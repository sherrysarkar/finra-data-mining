This is an appeal  from the\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\ndenial  of plaintiff's motion  to amend her  complaint to add\r\n\nEllen Kaplan, an insurance  broker, as a defendant in  a suit\r\n\narising out  of Paul Revere Life  Insurance Company's refusal\r\n\nto  pay  disability  insurance benefits  to  plaintiff's late\r\n\nhusband when he was suffering from his final illness.  In her\r\n\nmotion  to  amend,  plaintiff  sought  to  add  a  new  party\r\n\ndefendant  on  a  state law  claim  in  an  action which  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  was  simultaneously dismissing  against  the\r\n\noriginal defendants as  being preempted by  federal law.   We\r\n\nreview  the  denial  of the  motion  to  amend  for abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion and conclude that there is no such abuse under the\r\n\ncircumstances.   We  need not and  do not reach  the issue of\r\n\nwhether the state law misrepresentation claim is preempted by\r\n\nthe Employee Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.   1001 et\r                                                                         \r\n\nseq. (\"ERISA\").\r                \r\n\n          In  August  1992,  plaintiff's  husband  obtained a\r\n\ndisability  insurance policy  through his  employer, HomeView\r\n\nInc.   One month later he was  diagnosed with bone cancer and\r\n\nsought  disability benefits.  His request was denied as being\r\n\nrelated  to  a  preexisting  condition for  which  he  sought\r\n\ntreatment during the enrollment period.\r\n\n          After  her husband's death,  plaintiff brought suit\r\n\nin Massachusetts state court against Paul Revere and HomeView\r\n\nbased on state law misrepresentation theories.  The complaint\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nalleged  that  HomeView  supplied  its  employees,  including\r\n\nDonald  Golas,  with a  pamphlet,  prepared  by Paul  Revere,\r\n\nexplaining  the  rules   governing  preexisting   conditions.\r\n\nPlaintiff  contends that  this pamphlet  was misleading.   It\r\n\nindicated that  an insured individual could obtain disability\r\n\nbenefits  as long  as  the disability  was  not caused  by  a\r\n\nsickness that  required him  to consult  a doctor during  the\r\n\nthree  month enrollment  period.   Plaintiff claims  that, in\r\n\nreliance  on this  statement,  her husband  visited a  doctor\r\n\nduring  the enrollment  period  for  administrative  purposes\r\n\nonly.  However, he was not diagnosed with bone cancer at that\r\n\ntime.   It was this  visit, plaintiff alleges,  that made him\r\n\nineligible  to  receive  benefits.   Plaintiff  argues  that,\r\n\nabsent the flawed information,  her husband would have waited\r\n\nuntil  after the enrollment period ended  to visit the doctor\r\n\nand therefore would have been eligible for benefits.\r\n\n          Plaintiff  sought damages  in  state court  for her\r\n\nlate  husband's emotional  distress and  for her own  loss of\r\n\nconsortium.  Plaintiff simultaneously brought suit in federal\r\n\ncourt against the same  two defendants for benefits allegedly\r\n\ndue  under the  disability policy  pursuant to  ERISA.   That\r\n\nERISA  case  continues  to  be  pending  in  the  District of\r\n\nMassachusetts.   Defendants  removed  the state  law suit  to\r\n\nfederal court,  arguing that those claims  were also governed\r\n\nby ERISA.  The two cases were not consolidated.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          Once in federal court, Paul Revere moved to dismiss\r\n\nthe state  law claims,  arguing that they  were preempted  by\r\n\nERISA.1   Plaintiff countered by moving for a remand to state\r\n\ncourt.  While these motions were pending, plaintiff moved  to\r\n\namend the complaint  to add Kaplan as  a defendant, asserting\r\n\nthat, since  filing her  initial action, she  had \"discovered\r\n\nthat  critical  misrepresentations  upon  which  her  husband\r\n\nrelied  were made  to him  by Ellen  Kaplan.\"   The complaint\r\n\nalleged that, \"[p]rior to accepting disability  coverage, Mr.\r\n\nGolas  spoke to Ellen Kaplan who made false statements to him\r\n\nregarding  his  coverage under  the  disability policy,\"  and\r\n\nthat,  \"[a]s   the  broker  responsible  for  overseeing  the\r\n\nprovision  of  disability  insurance   from  Paul  Revere  to\r\n\nHomeView  employees, Ms. Kaplan owed Mr. Golas a duty to make\r\n\nsure she did nothing to interfere with his obtaining coverage\r\n\nunder the policy.\"\r\n\n          Defendants opposed  the motion  to add Kaplan  as a\r\n\ndefendant, arguing that amendment would be futile because the\r\n\nclaim  against  Kaplan  would  also be  preempted  by  ERISA.\r\n\nPlaintiff argued  that a  claim against Kaplan  would not  be\r\n\npreempted  by  ERISA  because  Kaplan was  not  an  agent  of\r\n\nHomeView or Paul Revere, but an independent insurance broker.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  HomeView made its own motion to dismiss some three months\r\nlater, incorporating by reference Paul Revere's arguments  in\r\nsupport.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          The   district   court  adopted   the  magistrate's\r\n\nrecommendation to grant  the motion to dismiss the  state law\r\n\nclaims  against  HomeView  and  Paul Revere  based  on  ERISA\r\n\npreemption.    The district court went on to consider whether\r\n\nto adopt  the magistrate's recommendation to deny plaintiff's\r\n\nmotion to amend the  complaint to add Kaplan as  a defendant.\r\n\nHaving  already decided  to dismiss  the claims  against Paul\r\n\nRevere  and HomeView, the  district court  was faced  with an\r\n\nanomalous situation.   Plaintiff wished to add a defendant to\r\n\na  case  which was  being dismissed  as  to the  two original\r\n\ndefendants.  In  addition, the ERISA cause of  action against\r\n\nPaul Revere and HomeView was pending in the same court but in\r\n\na different  action from the one in which the motion to amend\r\n\nwas filed.   The district court's ultimate  decision to adopt\r\n\nthe magistrate's  recommendation to deny the  motion to amend\r\n\nthe complaint must be viewed in this practical and procedural\r\n\ncontext.\r\n\n          Golas appeals only from the denial of the motion to\r\n\namend the complaint to add Kaplan as a defendant and not from\r\n\nthe dismissal of the underlying action on preemption grounds.\r\n\nReview is for abuse of discretion.  Reid v. New Hampshire, 56\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 332, 342 (1st Cir. 1995);  see also Carlo v. Reed Rolled\r                                                                         \r\n\nThread Die Co., 49 F.3d 790, 792 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that\r                          \r\n\nthe appeals court will \"generally defer to a district court's\r\n\ndecision  to deny leave to amend where the reason is apparent\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nor   declared\"   (internal  quotation   marks   and  citation\r\n\nomitted)).   It  is well-settled,  as the  concurring opinion\r\n\nfrom  our  respected  colleague  points  out,  that,  when  a\r\n\ndistrict court makes an error of law, by definition it abuses\r\n\nits discretion.  However, that is not the issue that concerns\r\n\nus here.  The facts and circumstances of the case necessarily\r\n\ninfluence our evaluation of the denial of the motion to amend\r\n\nthe  complaint, and here,  they make it  unnecessary to reach\r\n\nthe ERISA preemption issue.\r\n\n          We note that at the time the motion was denied, the\r\n\ntwo original defendants  had been dismissed and there  was no\r\n\ndiversity jurisdiction over Kaplan.2  Furthermore, a parallel\r\n\nERISA action was pending against HomeView and Paul Revere  in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  concurrence  argues that  the  ERISA  issue must  be\r\nreached  because  issues of  jurisdiction  must be  addressed\r\nfirst and, in  the absence  of diversity, there  is no  other\r\nbasis  for  federal jurisdiction.    This is  incorrect.   We\r\ndisagree with  the premise that  the court could  not address\r\nthe motion to amend without first addressing the ERISA issue.\r\nSecond, even  if the claim against Kaplan  were not preempted\r\nby  ERISA,   the  district  court  would   have  supplemental\r\njurisdiction over the claim, because  the other two state law\r\nclaims had properly been  before the district court.   In any\r\ncivil  action over  which the  district courts  have original\r\njurisdiction,  they also have  supplemental jurisdiction over\r\nall  other  claims  that  form  part  of  the  same  case  or\r\ncontroversy.    28 U.S.C.    1367.    The district  court had\r\njurisdiction over  the state  law claims against  Paul Revere\r\nand   HomeView  under   the  complete   preemption  doctrine.\r\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 65 (1987).\r                                                \r\nThis  is sufficient  to confer  original jurisdiction  on the\r\ndistrict courts.  Franchise  Tax Bd. v.

Federal courts have  traditionally been more\r\n\nreluctant to exercise jurisdiction over pendent  parties than\r\n\nover pendent claims.  See, e.g., Lykins v. Pointer, Inc., 725\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 645, 649 (11th Cir. 1984).3  Under these  circumstances,\r\n\nthe district court could not  have abused its discretion when\r\n\nit denied  plaintiff's motion to  amend the complaint  to add\r\n\nKaplan  as the sole  defendant.  Even  if our review  were de\r                                                                         \r\n\nnovo,  as the concurrence  suggests, we  could affirm  on any\r                \r\n\nlegal  ground supported in the  record.  See,  e.g., Eagan v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited  States, 80 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1996); Levy v. FDIC,\r                                                                        \r\n\n7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n          We  therefore uphold  the denial  of the  motion to\r\n\namend, albeit on  different grounds than  those relied on  by\r\n\nthe district court,  and thus  we express no  opinion on  the\r\n\npreemption issue.  This opinion does not, as  the concurrence\r\n\nclaims,  uphold the district  court's preemption decision sub\r                                                                         \r\n\nsilentio.  Plaintiff may decide to attempt to add Kaplan as a\r                    \r\n\ndefendant in the pending ERISA action.4  The district court's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The   codification   of  the   supplemental  jurisdiction\r\ndoctrine in  1990, which  makes clear that  such jurisdiction\r\nincludes  the  joinder of  additional  parties,  28 U.S.C.   \r\n1367(a), does not change the prudential analysis.\r\n\n4.  It is true that the three-year statute of limitations for\r\na state law based fraudulent misrepresentation claim expired,\r\nat the  very latest, in early  1996.  However, to  the extent\r\nthat  plaintiff has  a viable  state law  claim (on  which we\r\nexpress  no opinion),  the  claim could  apparently still  be\r\nbrought,  within a year of the date of this opinion, pursuant\r\nto Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260,   32.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nruling  that  any claim  against  Kaplan  would be  preempted\r\n\npresents  no bar.  It has no precedential or issue preclusive\r\n\neffect.   If  a motion  is made  to add  Kaplan to  the ERISA\r\n\naction,  the  court will  have  the ability  to  consider the\r\n\npreemption  issue anew in light  of the facts  that have been\r\n\ndeveloped in discovery.   Cf. Boston Children's Heart Found.,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc. v.  Nadal-Ginard, 73  F.3d 429,  439-40 (1st Cir.  1996)\r                                 \r\n\n(absent precedent on closely related issue, the inquiry as to\r\n\nwhether  state law is preempted requires the court to look at\r\n\nthe facts of the particular case).5\r\n\n          The decision of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                     \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  At oral argument we were advised that there was discovery\r\ntaken on  the issue of whether Kaplan was an agent, either of\r\nHomeView or of Paul Revere.  The  proffered amended complaint\r\nis ambiguous on this  issue, although the concurrence assumes\r\nthat Kaplan was not an agent of either  company.  In Kaplan's\r\ndeposition  testimony attached to Golas' brief, Kaplan states\r\nthat  she  held an  employee  benefits  meeting for  HomeView\r\nemployees to explain the Paul Revere disability policy and an\r\nAetna  insurance  policy  that  was  also  being  offered  to\r\nHomeView  employees.   This undermines  Golas' argument  that\r\nKaplan was  an independent broker.   The facts may  by now be\r\nestablished, but  no  findings are  before us.   However,  if\r\nKaplan  was  an agent  of either  of  the two  companies, the\r\nfactual assumption  underlying the concurrence  is incorrect,\r\nand the resulting legal  conclusions unjustified.  Indeed, if\r\nKaplan  is an agent of HomeView, the case would fall squarely\r\nwithin  the ambit of Vartanian  v.

In his  report and  recommendation,\r\n\nadopted by  the district  court, the magistrate  judge stated\r\n\nthe following  reason  for denying  the motion  to amend  the\r\n\ncomplaint:\r\n\n          I  find that Plaintiff['s] attempt to add\r\n          Ellen Kaplan as a  party defendant and to\r\n          assert   against   her   a    claim   for\r\n          misrepresentation would be futile because\r\n          such  a  claim  would  be  pre-empted  by\r\n          ERISA.\r\n\n          It is clear that the district court's denial of the\r\n\nmotion was not an  exercise of discretion, but  was compelled\r\n\nby  its legal ruling that  the claim against  Kaplan would be\r\n\npre-empted  by  ERISA.   Accordingly,  the  district  court's\r                                 .\r\n\ndenial of the  motion is  subject to review  de novo,  rather\r                                                                \r\n\nthan  for  abuse of  discretion.   See  Carlo v.  Reed Rolled\r                                                                         \r\n\nThread  Die Co.,  49  F.3d 790,  793 (1st  Cir.  1995).   The\r                           \r\n\nSupreme  Court has  stated  unequivocally that  \"[a] district\r\n\ncourt  by definition abuses  its discretion when  it makes an\r\n\nerror of law.\"  Koon v.  United States, 116 S. Ct. 2035, 2047\r                                                  \r\n\n(1996) (citation omitted).  \r\n\n          To  be sure,  in  the ordinary  case, the  decision\r\n\nwhether to grant or deny  a motion to amend the complaint  is\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ndiscretionary  with  the  trial  court, and  so  is  normally\r\n\nreviewed for abuse of  discretion; but the case before  us is\r\n\nnot ordinary  in this  respect.   Here it  is clear  that the\r\n\nmotion  was  denied   because  of  the   magistrate's  stated\r\n\nconclusion that the claim against  Kaplan was pre-empted as a\r\n\nmatter  of  law,  and  his unstated  but  apparent  corollary\r\n\nconclusion  that, as a result,  he was deprived of discretion\r\n\n(by the doctrine of futility) to grant the motion.  \r\n\n          Thus,  the question  before us  is not  whether the\r\n\ndistrict court  abused its discretion  in denying plaintiff's\r\n\nmotion to amend the complaint, but whether the basis for this\r\n\nruling was legally  correct.  If the  district court's ruling\r\n\nwas erroneous,  as I think it  was, then the  motion to amend\r\n\nwas  not \"futile\"  and should  not have  been denied  on that\r\n\nground.     As  a  consequence,  the   district  court  lacks\r\n\njurisdiction  to   decide   the  merits   of  the   state-law\r\n\nmisrepresentation claim because, as the majority acknowledges\r\n\ninferentially, the  only basis  for  federal jurisdiction  is\r\n\nERISA  pre-emption.   I  do not  think, therefore,  that this\r\n\nappeal  can   be  decided  on  a   principled  basis  without\r\n\ndiscussing the scope of ERISA pre-emption.  \r\n\n          The majority purports to \"express no opinion on the\r\n\npreemption issue,\"  and  suggests that  the  plaintiff  could\r\n\nstill pursue her claim against Kaplan by seeking to amend her\r\n\npending ERISA complaint so  as to add Kaplan as  a defendant.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nThe majority fails to  recognize, however, that the practical\r\n\neffect  of its  disposition  of the  case  is to  uphold  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's pre-emption  ruling  sub silentio,  and  to\r                                                               \r\n\nleave the plaintiff with no recourse in any forum.  A finding\r                                                       \r\n\nof  no pre-emption results in dismissal of the claim for lack\r\n\nof federal jurisdiction and leaves the plaintiff free to seek\r\n\nredress in state  court.  In contrast, the majority's refusal\r\n\nto  address the  merits of  the district  court's pre-emption\r\n\nruling is not only  analytically unsound, it also leaves  the\r\n\nplaintiff exactly  where she started --  with her state-court\r\n\naction subject to removal  to federal court on the  ground of\r\n\npre-emption  and with  pre-emption as  a bar  to recourse  in\r\n\nfederal court.       \r\n\n          For the reasons that  follow, I conclude that ERISA\r\n\ndoes not pre-empt plaintiff's misrepresentation claim against\r\n\nKaplan and  that, therefore,  the proper disposition  of this\r\n\ncase  would be to deny plaintiff's motion for lack of federal\r\n\njurisdiction  over the purported state-law claim, leaving the\r\n\nplaintiff free to pursue the claim in the state court.6 \r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          I  start my  analysis  with the  key  words of  the\r\n\nstatute bearing on pre-emption:\r\n\n             Except as provided  in subsection  (b)\r\n          of this section,  the provisions of  this\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.

Otherwise,  the\r\n          inefficiencies created could work  to the\r\n          detriment  of plan  beneficiaries. .  . .\r\n          Particularly disruptive  is the potential\r\n          for conflict  in substantive law.   It is\r\n          foreseeable that state courts, exercising\r\n          their  common  law powers,  might develop\r\n          different      substantive      standards\r\n          applicable to the same  employer conduct,\r\n          requiring  the  tailoring  of  plans  and\r\n          employer conduct to the  peculiarities of\r\n          the law  of each  jurisdiction.

Writing  for a unanimous\r                                     \r\n\nCourt, Justice  Souter made a  number of observations  on the\r\n\nscope of ERISA pre-emption:\r\n\n               Our past cases have  recognized that\r\n          the Supremacy Clause,  U.S. Const.,  Art.\r\n          VI,  may entail pre-emption  of state law\r\n          either    by   express    provision,   by\r\n          implication,  or  by  a conflict  between\r\n          federal and state law.   And yet, despite\r\n          the  variety  of these  opportunities for\r\n          federal   preeminence,   we  have   never\r\n          assumed   lightly   that   Congress   has\r\n          derogated  state regulation,  but instead\r\n          have addressed claims of pre-emption with\r\n          the  starting  presumption that  Congress\r\n          does  not intend  to supplant  state law.\r\n          Indeed,  in cases  like  this one,  where\r\n          federal  law is said  to bar state action\r\n          in    fields    of   traditional    state\r\n          regulation,   we   have  worked   on  the\r\n          assumption   that  the   historic  police\r\n          powers of  the  States  were  not  to  be\r\n          superseded by the Federal Act unless that\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          was  the  clear and  manifest  purpose of\r\n          Congress.\r\n\nId. at 1676 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\r               \r\n\nThe Court commented on  the statutory pre-emption language of\r\n\n  514(a), \"all state laws insofar as they . . . relate to any\r\n\nemployee benefit  plan,\" pointing out that  \"[i]f 'relate to'\r\n\nwere   taken  to  extend  to  the  furthest  stretch  of  its\r\n\nindeterminacy,  then for  all practical  purposes pre-emption\r\n\nwould never  run its  course.\"     Id. at  1677.

Over a year  after the replacement\r\n\npolicy  was  issued,  plaintiff  had  total  hip  replacement\r\n\nsurgery.

See\r                                                                         \r\n\nDegnan  v. Publicker  Indus.,  Inc., 83  F.3d  at 28-29.    I\r                                               \r\n\nrecognize that the standard of review for  a district court's\r\n\nrefusal  to allow an amendment  to the complaint  is abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.   This standard is not  applicable here, however,\r\n\nbecause the root issue -- stated by the district court as the\r\n\nbasis for its decision -- is ERISA pre-emption, a question of\r\n\nlaw.  See  Carlo v. Reed  Rolled Thread Die  Co., 49 F.3d  at\r                                                            \r\n\n792-93.   Moreover, if there  is no pre-emption,  the federal\r\n\ncourts are bereft of  jurisdiction.  Thus, in my  view, there\r\n\nis no way of avoiding the pre-emption issue.\r\n\n          Normally in  a pre-emption case  the starting point\r\n\nis an examination of the facts,  but there is not much in the\r\n\nway  of  facts  here.   All  we  know  is  derived  from  the\r\n\nallegations in the purported amended complaint, which must be\r\n\naccepted  as true  at this  stage of  the litigation.   These\r\n\nallegations can only be construed as stating that Kaplan made\r\n\nmisrepresentations  to  plaintiff's  husband,  Donald  Golas,\r\n\nand/or  failed  to give  him  correct  information about  the\r\n\nconditions of  eligibility for  participation  in the  Revere\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nInsurance policy.  The  amended complaint alleges that Kaplan\r\n\nwas an insurance broker.  I take that to mean that she \"sold\"\r\n\nRevere's insurance  policy to  HomeView.  Although  Kaplan is\r\n\nlinked   to   HomeView  and   Revere   as   to  the   alleged\r\n\nmisrepresentations, there  is no  claim that Kaplan  acted as\r\n\nagent for  or on behalf  of either or  both of the  other two\r\n\ndefendants.     The  amended  complaint,  broadly  construed,\r\n\nalleges  a common-law misrepresentation  claim against Kaplan\r\n\nindividually.\r\n\n          Strictly speaking, the  ERISA disability  insurance\r\n\nplan  is  not  implicated  in  plaintiff's  misrepresentation\r\n\nclaim.    Donald  Golas  never  became  a  covered  employee;\r\n\ninstead,    the    complaint   focuses    on    the   alleged\r\n\nmisrepresentations which plaintiff alleges  were the cause of\r\n\nGolas's being excluded from  insurance coverage.  Neither the\r\n\nextent of insurance  coverage nor the  amount of benefits  is\r\n\ninvolved.   Even the eligibility  requirements themselves are\r\n\nnot  in dispute;  it is  only the  alleged misrepresentations\r\n\nabout  those  eligibility  requirements  that  give  rise  to\r\n\nplaintiff's  cause of  action.   Plaintiff's burden  of proof\r\n\nthus  goes to whether her husband would have been eligible to\r\n\njoin the plan if Kaplan had not made misrepresentations as to\r\n\nhis eligibility.   See Coyne  &amp; Delaney Co., 98  F.3d at 1462\r                                                       \r\n\nn.4.\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\n          This case is markedly different from Carlo, 49 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n790.   In  Carlo,  the plaintiff  was  a former  employee  of\r                            \r\n\ndefendant  Reed and  a  participant in  its retirement  plan.\r\n\nPlaintiff  Carlo elected  early  retirement on  the basis  of\r\n\nmonthly  benefits he was told  he would receive.   The actual\r\n\nmonthly benefits  he received  were twenty percent  less than\r\n\nthe amount promised  him.  Defendant apologized for the error\r\n\nand offered to let him continue working at the same position.\r\n\nCarlo did  not accept  the offer  and  took early  retirement\r\n\nunder protest.  He subsequently brought suit in Massachusetts\r\n\nstate  court   for   breach   of   contract   and   negligent\r\n\nmisrepresentation.  Id. at 792.   We found ERISA pre-emption.\r                                   \r\n\n          In Carlo,  plaintiff had been a  participant in the\r                              \r\n\nplan  and one  of  the  issues  was  the  amount  of  monthly\r\n\nretirement pay  due him  under the substantive  provisions of\r\n\nthe plan.  Here, by contrast, Donald  Golas was not a covered\r\n\nemployee  and none  of the  issues implicate  the substantive\r\n\nprovisions of the insurance plan.  The allegations are solely\r\n\nconcerned    with   misrepresentations    regarding   Golas's\r\n\neligibility to become a covered employee.\r\n\n          The analysis used in Boston Children's Heart Found.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Nadal-Ginard  has  much  to  recommend  it.    In  Boston\r                                                                         \r\n\nChildren's Heart  Found., 73 F.3d  429, suit  was brought  in\r                                    \r\n\nfederal  district  court against  defendant,  who worked  for\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nplaintiff nonprofit corporation  as an officer and  director.\r\n\nThe suit  alleged that defendant breached  his fiduciary duty\r\n\nby misappropriating plaintiff's funds.  The basis of the suit\r\n\nwas defendant's failure to disclose to the other directors of\r\n\nthe corporation important  information concerning  provisions\r\n\nof a severance-benefit plan (the Banks Plan) he  had devised.\r\n\nWhen the  plan was  terminated on defendant's  initiative, he\r\n\nreceived  more than  $4,000,000  in severance  benefits.   On\r\n\nappeal defendant  contended that ERISA  specifically exempted\r\n\nthe  type  of  severance  benefits  plan at  issue  from  its\r\n\nfiduciary duty provisions  and pre-empted the  application of\r\n\nstate fiduciary law.  73 F.3d at 438.  We held:\r\n\n          Here,  the  alleged  breach of  fiduciary\r\n          duty relates to Nadal-Ginard's  action in\r\n          establishing   the  Banks   Plan  without\r\n          disclosing   information  that   a  self-\r\n          interested fiduciary would be required to\r\n          reveal  to his fellow  directors.  Nadal-\r\n          Ginard's  misconduct preceded  the formal\r\n          adoption   of  the   plan.     The  legal\r\n          determination that Nadal-Ginard's conduct\r\n          constitutes a fiduciary  breach does  not\r\n          require  the  resolution  of any  dispute\r\n          about      the     interpretation      or\r\n          administration of the plan.  Further, the\r                                                               \r\n          application of state law in this instance\r                                                               \r\n          does   not   raise   the   core   concern\r                                                               \r\n          underlying ERISA preemption.  Indeed, the\r                                                 \r\n          fact  that  Nadal-Ginard  chose an  ERISA\r\n          plan  rather  than  some  other  form  of\r\n          compensation   is   peripheral   to   the\r\n          underlying   claim    that   Nadal-Ginard\r\n          breached his corporate responsibilities.\r\n\n               This  being the  case, it  cannot be\r\n          said  that  Massachusetts  fiduciary  law\r\n          must be preempted in this instance. \r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nId. at 440 (emphasis added). \r               \r\n\n          Based  upon our own  circuit cases, the restriction\r\n\nof the scope  of pre-emption  under   514(a)  of the  statute\r\n\nestablished in  Travelers, and  the  post-Travelers cases  in\r                                                               \r\n\nother circuits,  it is evident  that ERISA does  not pre-empt\r\n\nthe misrepresentation claim against  Ellen Kaplan.  There are\r\n\neight  reasons,  gleaned  from  the  cited  cases,  for  this\r\n\nconclusion.   (1) No ERISA  benefits are sought  and no ERISA\r\n\nrights  or obligations  are asserted.   (2)  Defendant Kaplan\r\n\nwould be personally responsible for any money damages awarded\r\n\nto plaintiff.   (3) Defendant Kaplan is not an  ERISA entity,\r\n\nnor  does the  alleged  misrepresentation  claim  affect  the\r\n\nrelationship between  ERISA entities.  (4) None  of the three\r\n\ncategories  of  state  laws  that  Travelers  holds  Congress\r                                                        \r\n\nintended  to pre-empt  are  implicated.   (5) The  common-law\r\n\nclaim  of  misrepresentation  is   a  state  law  of  general\r\n\napplication.  Moreover, tort  law in general is traditionally\r\n\nan area of state  regulation.  It is therefore  unlikely that\r\n\nCongress intended  to intrude into this  area by pre-emption.\r\n\n(6)  Congress  did  not  intend to  shield  tortfeasors  from\r\n\nliability for misrepresentation where ERISA benefits, rights,\r\n\nobligations, and core concerns are not implicated.  (7) State\r\n\ncommon law imposes a duty of care relative to representations\r\n\nmade by  insurance professionals which  does not  in any  way\r\n\ndepend   upon  ERISA.    (8)  The  alleged  misrepresentation\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\noccurred prior to  the time  when the ERISA  plan would  have\r\n\ntaken effect.\r\n\n          I would  hold, therefore, that  the district  court\r\n\ncommitted reversible error  in denying plaintiff's  motion to\r\n\namend on the ground  that the claim raised therein  \"would be\r\n\npre-empted  by ERISA.\"7  Because ERISA  does not pre-empt the\r\n\nclaim asserted against  Ellen Kaplan, and because there is no\r\n\ndiversity of  citizenship between the parties,  nor any other\r\n\nbasis for  federal jurisdiction, the motion  should have been\r\n\ndenied for lack of federal jurisdiction.  Plaintiff should be\r\n\nleft to pursue her  misrepresentation claim against Kaplan in\r\n\nthe Massachusetts state courts.  \r\n\n          Although the  majority and I agree  on the ultimate\r\n\nresult, we disagree as to the proper path to take in reaching\r\n\nit.   Because  I  think that  this  is a  case  in which  the\r\n\nprocedural path  is  important, I  must respectfully  concur,\r\n\nrather than join the majority opinion.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  I  would  also hold  that  the  district court  erred  in\r\nadopting the magistrate's recommendation, without considering\r\nthe application of ERISA to Kaplan as an individual, in light\r\nof  the differences  between her  status vis-a-vis  ERISA and\r\nthat of the other defendants.  Instead, the magistrate merely\r\nsaid, \"For the reason stated . . . [regarding Paul Revere and\r\nHomeView] . . .,\" plaintiff's claim against Kaplan would also\r\n\"be pre-empted by ERISA.\"   He simply assumed that,  if ERISA\r\npre-empted  the claim  against Revere  and HomeView,  it must\r\nlikewise  pre-empt  the  claim  against Kaplan.    Given  the\r\ndistinctions between  Kaplan's status as an  ERISA entity and\r\nthat of  the other defendants,  this failure to  consider the\r\nclaim  against Kaplan on its own merit also constituted legal\r\nerror.\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n",

In her motion to amend, plaintiff sought to add a new party defendant on a state law claim in an action which the district court was simultaneously dismissing against the original defendants as being preempted by federal law.  We review the denial of the motion to amend for abuse of discretion and conclude that there is no such abuse under the circumstances.  We need not and do not reach the issue of whether the state law misrepresentation claim is preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 et seq.

The complaint alleged that HomeView supplied its employees, including Donald Golas, with a pamphlet, prepared by Paul Revere, explaining the rules governing preexisting conditions.  Plaintiff contends that this pamphlet was misleading.  It indicated that an insured individual could obtain disability benefits as long as the disability was not caused by a sickness that required him to consult a doctor during the three month enrollment period.  Plaintiff claims that, in reliance on this statement, her husband visited a doctor during the enrollment period for administrative purposes only.  However, he was not diagnosed with bone cancer at that time.  It was this visit, plaintiff alleges, that made him ineligible to receive benefits.  Plaintiff argues that, absent the flawed information, her husband would have waited until after the enrollment period ended to visit the doctor and therefore would have been eligible for benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff sought damages in state court for her late husband's emotional distress and for her own loss of consortium.  Plaintiff simultaneously brought suit in federal court against the same two defendants for benefits allegedly due under the disability policy pursuant to ERISA.  That ERISA case continues to be pending in the District of Massachusetts.  Defendants removed the state law suit to federal court, arguing that those claims were also governed by ERISA.

While these motions were pending, plaintiff moved to amend the complaint to add Kaplan as a defendant, asserting that, since filing her initial action, she had \"discovered that critical misrepresentations upon which her husband relied were made to him by Ellen Kaplan.\"   The complaint alleged that, \"[p]rior to accepting disability coverage, Mr. Golas spoke to Ellen Kaplan who made false statements to him regarding his coverage under the disability policy,\" and that, \"[a]s the broker responsible for overseeing the provision of disability insurance from Paul Revere to HomeView employees, Ms. Kaplan owed Mr. Golas a duty to make sure she did nothing to interfere with his obtaining coverage under the policy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants opposed the motion to add Kaplan as a defendant, arguing that amendment would be futile because the claim against Kaplan would also be preempted by ERISA.  Plaintiff argued that a claim against Kaplan would not be preempted by ERISA because Kaplan was not an agent of HomeView or Paul Revere, but an independent insurance broker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the magistrate's recommendation to grant the motion to dismiss the state law claims against HomeView and Paul Revere based on ERISA preemption.  The district court went on to consider whether to adopt the magistrate's recommendation to deny plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to add Kaplan as a defendant.  Having already decided to dismiss the claims against Paul Revere and HomeView, the district court was faced with an anomalous situation.  Plaintiff wished to add a defendant to a case which was being dismissed as to the two original defendants.  In addition, the ERISA cause of action against Paul Revere and HomeView was pending in the same court but in a different action from the one in which the motion to amend was filed.  The district court's ultimate decision to adopt the magistrate's recommendation to deny the motion to amend the complaint must be viewed in this practical and procedural context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Golas appeals only from the denial of the motion to amend the complaint to add Kaplan as a defendant and not from the dismissal of the underlying action on preemption grounds.  Review is for abuse of discretion.  Reid v. New Hampshire, 56 F.3d 332, 342 (1st Cir.1995);  see also Carlo v. Reed Rolled Thread Die Co., 49 F.3d 790, 792 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that the appeals court will \"generally defer to a district court's decision to deny leave to amend where the reason is apparent or declared\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  It is well-settled, as the concurring opinion from our respected colleague points out, that, when a district court makes an error of law, by definition it abuses its discretion.  However, that is not the issue that concerns us here.  The facts and circumstances of the case necessarily influence our evaluation of the denial of the motion to amend the complaint, and here, they make it unnecessary to reach the ERISA preemption issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that at the time the motion was denied, the two original defendants had been dismissed and there was no diversity jurisdiction over Kaplan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Furthermore, a parallel ERISA action was pending against HomeView and Paul Revere in federal court.  Federal courts have traditionally been more reluctant to exercise jurisdiction over pendent parties than over pendent claims.  See, e.g., Lykins v. Pointer, Inc., 725 F.2d 645, 649 (11th Cir.1984).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Under these circumstances, the district court could not have abused its discretion when it denied plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to add Kaplan as the sole defendant.  Even if our review were de novo, as the concurrence suggests, we could affirm on any legal ground supported in the record.  See, e.g., Eagan v. United States, 80 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1996);  Levy v. FDIC, 7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore uphold the denial of the motion to amend, albeit on different grounds than those relied on by the district court, and thus we express no opinion on the preemption issue.  This opinion does not, as the concurrence claims, uphold the district court's preemption decision sub silentio.   Plaintiff may decide to attempt to add Kaplan as a defendant in the pending ERISA action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The district court's ruling that any claim against Kaplan would be preempted presents no bar.  It has no precedential or issue preclusive effect.  If a motion is made to add Kaplan to the ERISA action, the court will have the ability to consider the preemption issue anew in light of the facts that have been developed in discovery.  Cf. Boston Children's Heart Found., Inc. v. Nadal-Ginard, 73 F.3d 429, 439-40 (1st Cir.1996) (absent precedent on closely related issue, the inquiry as to whether state law is preempted requires the court to look at the facts of the particular case).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I concur in the result, but, with respect, I do not think that this case can be disposed of by the conclusory assertion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff's motion to amend her complaint so as to add Ellen Kaplan as a defendant.  In his report and recommendation, adopted by the district court, the magistrate judge stated the following reason for denying the motion to amend the complaint:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>I find that Plaintiff['s] attempt to add Ellen Kaplan as a party defendant and to assert against her a claim for misrepresentation would be futile because such a claim would be pre-empted by ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that the district court's denial of the motion was not an exercise of discretion, but was compelled by its legal ruling that the claim against Kaplan would be preempted by ERISA.  Accordingly, the district court's denial of the motion is subject to review de novo, rather than for abuse of discretion.  See Carlo v. Reed Rolled Thread Die Co., 49 F.3d 790, 793 (1st Cir.1995).  The Supreme Court has stated unequivocally that \"[a] district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\"  Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, in the ordinary case, the decision whether to grant or deny a motion to amend the complaint is discretionary with the trial court, and so is normally reviewed for abuse of discretion;  but the case before us is not ordinary in this respect.  Here it is clear that the motion was denied because of the magistrate's stated conclusion that the claim against Kaplan was pre-empted as a matter of law, and his unstated but apparent corollary conclusion that, as a result, he was deprived of discretion (by the doctrine of futility) to grant the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the question before us is not whether the district court abused its discretion in denying plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint, but whether the basis for this ruling was legally correct.  If the district court's ruling was erroneous, as I think it was, then the motion to amend was not \"futile\" and should not have been denied on that ground.  As a consequence, the district court lacks jurisdiction to decide the merits of the state-law misrepresentation claim because, as the majority acknowledges inferentially, the only basis for federal jurisdiction is ERISA pre-emption.  I do not think, therefore, that this appeal can be decided on a principled basis without discussing the scope of ERISA pre-emption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority purports to \"express no opinion on the preemption issue,\" and suggests that the plaintiff could still pursue her claim against Kaplan by seeking to amend her pending ERISA complaint so as to add Kaplan as a defendant.  The majority fails to recognize, however, that the practical effect of its disposition of the case is to uphold the district court's pre-emption ruling sub silentio, and to leave the plaintiff with no recourse in any forum.  A finding of no preemption results in dismissal of the claim for lack of federal jurisdiction and leaves the plaintiff free to seek redress in state court.  In contrast, the majority's refusal to address the merits of the district court's pre-emption ruling is not only analytically unsound, it also leaves the plaintiff exactly where she started--with her state-court action subject to removal to federal court on the ground of pre-emption and with pre-emption as a bar to recourse in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons that follow, I conclude that ERISA does not pre-empt plaintiff's misrepresentation claim against Kaplan and that, therefore, the proper disposition of this case would be to deny plaintiff's motion for lack of federal jurisdiction over the purported state-law claim, leaving the plaintiff free to pursue the claim in the state court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I start my analysis with the key words of the statute bearing on pre-emption:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan ....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this section:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>(1) The term \"State law\" includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law, of any State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court teaches that the pre-emption provision of &#167; 514(a), codified at 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a), was intended</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of benefits law;  the goal was to minimize the administrative and financial burden of complying with conflicting directives among States or between States and the Federal Government.

VI, may entail pre-emption of state law either by express provision, by implication, or by a conflict between federal and state law.  And yet, despite the variety of these opportunities for federal preeminence, we have never assumed lightly that Congress has derogated state regulation, but instead have addressed claims of pre-emption with the starting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law.  Indeed, in cases like this one, where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation, we have worked on the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1676 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

As we have discussed, Congress enacted ERISA to protect the interests of employees and other beneficiaries of employee benefit plans.  To immunize insurance agents from personal liability for fraudulent misrepresentation regarding ERISA plans would not promote this objective.  If ERISA preempts a beneficiary's potential cause of action for misrepresentation, employees, beneficiaries, and employers choosing among various plans will no longer be able to rely on the representations of the insurance agent regarding the terms of the plan.  These employees, whom Congress sought to protect, will find themselves unable to make informed choices regarding available benefit plans where state law places the duty on agents to deal honestly with applicants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 723-24 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Health and Welfare Fund v.

The question of ERISA pre-emption is reviewed de novo.  See Degnan v. Publicker Indus., Inc., 83 F.3d at 28-29.   I recognize that the standard of review for a district court's refusal to allow an amendment to the complaint is abuse of discretion.  This standard is not applicable here, however, because the root issue--stated by the district court as the basis for its decision--is ERISA pre-emption, a question of law.  See Carlo v. Reed Rolled Thread Die Co., 49 F.3d at 792-93.   Moreover, if there is no pre-emption, the federal courts are bereft of jurisdiction.  Thus, in my view, there is no way of avoiding the pre-emption issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normally in a pre-emption case the starting point is an examination of the facts, but there is not much in the way of facts here.  All we know is derived from the allegations in the purported amended complaint, which must be accepted as true at this stage of the litigation.  These allegations can only be construed as stating that Kaplan made misrepresentations to plaintiff's husband, Donald Golas, and/or failed to give him correct information about the conditions of eligibility for participation in the Revere Insurance policy.  The amended complaint alleges that Kaplan was an insurance broker.  I take that to mean that she \"sold\" Revere's insurance policy to HomeView.  Although Kaplan is linked to HomeView and Revere as to the alleged misrepresentations, there is no claim that Kaplan acted as agent for or on behalf of either or both of the other two defendants.  The amended complaint, broadly construed, alleges a common-law misrepresentation claim against Kaplan individually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Strictly speaking, the ERISA disability insurance plan is not implicated in plaintiff's misrepresentation claim.  Donald Golas never became a covered employee;  instead, the complaint focuses on the alleged misrepresentations which plaintiff alleges were the cause of Golas's being excluded from insurance coverage.  Neither the extent of insurance coverage nor the amount of benefits is involved.  Even the eligibility requirements themselves are not in dispute;  it is only the alleged misrepresentations about those eligibility requirements that give rise to plaintiff's cause of action.  Plaintiff's burden of proof thus goes to whether her husband would have been eligible to join the plan if Kaplan had not made misrepresentations as to his eligibility.  See Coyne &amp; Delany Co., 98 F.3d at 1462 n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is markedly different from Carlo, 49 F.3d 790.   In Carlo, the plaintiff was a former employee of defendant Reed and a participant in its retirement plan.  Plaintiff Carlo elected early retirement on the basis of monthly benefits he was told he would receive.  The actual monthly benefits he received were twenty percent less than the amount promised him.  Defendant apologized for the error and offered to let him continue working at the same position.  Carlo did not accept the offer and took early retirement under protest.  He subsequently brought suit in Massachusetts state court for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation.  Id. at 792.   We found ERISA pre-emption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Carlo, plaintiff had been a participant in the plan and one of the issues was the amount of monthly retirement pay due him under the substantive provisions of the plan.  Here, by contrast, Donald Golas was not a covered employee and none of the issues implicate the substantive provisions of the insurance plan.  The allegations are solely concerned with misrepresentations regarding Golas's eligibility to become a covered employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The analysis used in Boston Children's Heart Found. v. Nadal-Ginard has much to recommend it.  In Boston Children's Heart Found., 73 F.3d 429, suit was brought in federal district court against defendant, who worked for plaintiff nonprofit corporation as an officer and director.  The suit alleged that defendant breached his fiduciary duty by misappropriating plaintiff's funds.  The basis of the suit was defendant's failure to disclose to the other directors of the corporation important information concerning provisions of a severance-benefit plan (the Banks Plan) he had devised.  When the plan was terminated on defendant's initiative, he received more than $4,000,000 in severance benefits.  On appeal defendant contended that ERISA specifically exempted the type of severance benefits plan at issue from its fiduciary duty provisions and pre-empted the application of state fiduciary law.  73 F.3d at 438.   We held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>Here, the alleged breach of fiduciary duty relates to Nadal-Ginard's action in establishing the Banks Plan without disclosing information that a self-interested fiduciary would be required to reveal to his fellow directors.  Nadal-Ginard's misconduct preceded the formal adoption of the plan.  The legal determination that Nadal-Ginard's conduct constitutes a fiduciary breach does not require the resolution of any dispute about the interpretation or administration of the plan.  Further, the application of state law in this instance does not raise the core concern underlying ERISA preemption.   Indeed, the fact that Nadal-Ginard chose an ERISA plan rather than some other form of compensation is peripheral to the underlying claim that Nadal-Ginard breached his corporate responsibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This being the case, it cannot be said that Massachusetts fiduciary law must be preempted in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 440 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon our own circuit cases, the restriction of the scope of pre-emption under &#167; 514(a) of the statute established in Travelers, and the post-Travelers cases in other circuits, it is evident that ERISA does not pre-empt the misrepresentation claim against Ellen Kaplan.  There are eight reasons, gleaned from the cited cases, for this conclusion.  (1) No ERISA benefits are sought and no ERISA rights or obligations are asserted.  (2) Defendant Kaplan would be personally responsible for any money damages awarded to plaintiff.  (3) Defendant Kaplan is not an ERISA entity, nor does the alleged misrepresentation claim affect the relationship between ERISA entities.  (4) None of the three categories of state laws that Travelers holds Congress intended to pre-empt are implicated.  (5) The common-law claim of misrepresentation is a state law of general application.  Moreover, tort law in general is traditionally an area of state regulation.  It is therefore unlikely that Congress intended to intrude into this area by pre-emption.  (6) Congress did not intend to shield tortfeasors from liability for misrepresentation where ERISA benefits, rights, obligations, and core concerns are not implicated.  (7) State common law imposes a duty of care relative to representations made by insurance professionals which does not in any way depend upon ERISA.  (8) The alleged misrepresentation occurred prior to the time when the ERISA plan would have taken effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would hold, therefore, that the district court committed reversible error in denying plaintiff's motion to amend on the ground that the claim raised therein \"would be pre-empted by ERISA.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Because ERISA does not pre-empt the claim asserted against Ellen Kaplan, and because there is no diversity of citizenship between the parties, nor any other basis for federal jurisdiction, the motion should have been denied for lack of federal jurisdiction.  Plaintiff should be left to pursue her misrepresentation claim against Kaplan in the Massachusetts state courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the majority and I agree on the ultimate result, we disagree as to the proper path to take in reaching it.  Because I think that this is a case in which the procedural path is important, I must respectfully concur, rather than join the majority opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> HomeView made its own motion to dismiss some three months later, incorporating by reference Paul Revere's arguments in support</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The concurrence argues that the ERISA issue must be reached because issues of jurisdiction must be addressed first and, in the absence of diversity, there is no other basis for federal jurisdiction.  This is incorrect.  We disagree with the premise that the court could not address the motion to amend without first addressing the ERISA issue.  Second, even if the claim against Kaplan were not preempted by ERISA, the district court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the claim, because the other two state law claims had properly been before the district court.  In any civil action over which the district courts have original jurisdiction, they also have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that form part of the same case or controversy.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367.  The district court had jurisdiction over the state law claims against Paul Revere and HomeView under the complete preemption doctrine.  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 65, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 1547, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987).  This is sufficient to confer original jurisdiction on the district courts.  Franchise Tax Bd. v.

Gen. Laws ch. 260, &#167; 32</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> At oral argument we were advised that there was discovery taken on the issue of whether Kaplan was an agent, either of HomeView or of Paul Revere.  The proffered amended complaint is ambiguous on this issue, although the concurrence assumes that Kaplan was not an agent of either company.  In Kaplan's deposition testimony attached to Golas' brief, Kaplan states that she held an employee benefits meeting for HomeView employees to explain the Paul Revere disability policy and an Aetna insurance policy that was also being offered to HomeView employees.  This undermines Golas' argument that Kaplan was an independent broker.  The facts may by now be established, but no findings are before us.  However, if Kaplan was an agent of either of the two companies, the factual assumption underlying the concurrence is incorrect, and the resulting legal conclusions unjustified.  Indeed, if Kaplan is an agent of HomeView, the case would fall squarely within the ambit of Vartanian v. Monsanto Co., 14 F.3d 697 (1st Cir.1994)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> I, of course, intimate no opinion as to the merits of plaintiff's state-law claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> I would also hold that the district court erred in adopting the magistrate's recommendation, without considering the application of ERISA to Kaplan as an individual, in light of the differences between her status vis-a-vis ERISA and that of the other defendants.  Instead, the magistrate merely said, \"For the reason stated ... [regarding Paul Revere and HomeView] ...,\" plaintiff's claim against Kaplan would also \"be pre-empted by ERISA.\"   He simply assumed that, if ERISA pre-empted the claim against Revere and HomeView, it must likewise pre-empt the claim against Kaplan.  Given the distinctions between Kaplan's status as an ERISA entity and that of the other defendants, this failure to consider the claim against Kaplan on its own merit also constituted legal error</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In her motion to amend, plaintiff sought to add a new party defendant on a state law claim in an action which the district court was simultaneously dismissing against the original defendants as being preempted by federal law.  We review the denial of the motion to amend for abuse of discretion and conclude that there is no such abuse under the circumstances.  We need not and do not reach the issue of whether the state law misrepresentation claim is preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 et seq.  (\"ERISA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1992, plaintiff's husband obtained a disability insurance policy through his employer, HomeView Inc. One month later he was diagnosed with bone cancer and sought disability benefits.  His request was denied as being related to a preexisting condition for which he sought treatment during the enrollment period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After her husband's death, plaintiff brought suit in Massachusetts state court against Paul Revere and HomeView based on state law misrepresentation theories.  The complaint alleged that HomeView supplied its employees, including Donald Golas, with a pamphlet, prepared by Paul Revere, explaining the rules governing preexisting conditions.  Plaintiff contends that this pamphlet was misleading.  It indicated that an insured individual could obtain disability benefits as long as the disability was not caused by a sickness that required him to consult a doctor during the three month enrollment period.  Plaintiff claims that, in reliance on this statement, her husband visited a doctor during the enrollment period for administrative purposes only.  However, he was not diagnosed with bone cancer at that time.  It was this visit, plaintiff alleges, that made him ineligible to receive benefits.  Plaintiff argues that, absent the flawed information, her husband would have waited until after the enrollment period ended to visit the doctor and therefore would have been eligible for benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff sought damages in state court for her late husband's emotional distress and for her own loss of consortium.  Plaintiff simultaneously brought suit in federal court against the same two defendants for benefits allegedly due under the disability policy pursuant to ERISA.  That ERISA case continues to be pending in the District of Massachusetts.  Defendants removed the state law suit to federal court, arguing that those claims were also governed by ERISA.  The two cases were not consolidated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once in federal court, Paul Revere moved to dismiss the state law claims, arguing that they were preempted by ERISA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Plaintiff countered by moving for a remand to state court.  While these motions were pending, plaintiff moved to amend the complaint to add Kaplan as a defendant, asserting that, since filing her initial action, she had \"discovered that critical misrepresentations upon which her husband relied were made to him by Ellen Kaplan.\"   The complaint alleged that, \"[p]rior to accepting disability coverage, Mr. Golas spoke to Ellen Kaplan who made false statements to him regarding his coverage under the disability policy,\" and that, \"[a]s the broker responsible for overseeing the provision of disability insurance from Paul Revere to HomeView employees, Ms. Kaplan owed Mr. Golas a duty to make sure she did nothing to interfere with his obtaining coverage under the policy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants opposed the motion to add Kaplan as a defendant, arguing that amendment would be futile because the claim against Kaplan would also be preempted by ERISA.  Plaintiff argued that a claim against Kaplan would not be preempted by ERISA because Kaplan was not an agent of HomeView or Paul Revere, but an independent insurance broker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the magistrate's recommendation to grant the motion to dismiss the state law claims against HomeView and Paul Revere based on ERISA preemption.  The district court went on to consider whether to adopt the magistrate's recommendation to deny plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to add Kaplan as a defendant.  Having already decided to dismiss the claims against Paul Revere and HomeView, the district court was faced with an anomalous situation.  Plaintiff wished to add a defendant to a case which was being dismissed as to the two original defendants.  In addition, the ERISA cause of action against Paul Revere and HomeView was pending in the same court but in a different action from the one in which the motion to amend was filed.  The district court's ultimate decision to adopt the magistrate's recommendation to deny the motion to amend the complaint must be viewed in this practical and procedural context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Golas appeals only from the denial of the motion to amend the complaint to add Kaplan as a defendant and not from the dismissal of the underlying action on preemption grounds.

This opinion does not, as the concurrence claims, uphold the district court's preemption decision sub silentio.   Plaintiff may decide to attempt to add Kaplan as a defendant in the pending ERISA action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The district court's ruling that any claim against Kaplan would be preempted presents no bar.  It has no precedential or issue preclusive effect.  If a motion is made to add Kaplan to the ERISA action, the court will have the ability to consider the preemption issue anew in light of the facts that have been developed in discovery.  Cf. Boston Children's Heart Found., Inc. v.

In his report and recommendation, adopted by the district court, the magistrate judge stated the following reason for denying the motion to amend the complaint:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>I find that Plaintiff['s] attempt to add Ellen Kaplan as a party defendant and to assert against her a claim for misrepresentation would be futile because such a claim would be pre-empted by ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that the district court's denial of the motion was not an exercise of discretion, but was compelled by its legal ruling that the claim against Kaplan would be preempted by ERISA.  Accordingly, the district court's denial of the motion is subject to review de novo, rather than for abuse of discretion.  See Carlo v. Reed Rolled Thread Die Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691308\"><a href=\"/opinion/691308/pens-plan-guide-p-23907e-victor-e-carlo-jr-and-kathleen-m-carlo-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span>, 793 (1st Cir.1995).  The Supreme Court has stated unequivocally that \"[a] district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\"  Koon v.

Here it is clear that the motion was denied because of the magistrate's stated conclusion that the claim against Kaplan was pre-empted as a matter of law, and his unstated but apparent corollary conclusion that, as a result, he was deprived of discretion (by the doctrine of futility) to grant the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the question before us is not whether the district court abused its discretion in denying plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint, but whether the basis for this ruling was legally correct.  If the district court's ruling was erroneous, as I think it was, then the motion to amend was not \"futile\" and should not have been denied on that ground.  As a consequence, the district court lacks jurisdiction to decide the merits of the state-law misrepresentation claim because, as the majority acknowledges inferentially, the only basis for federal jurisdiction is ERISA pre-emption.  I do not think, therefore, that this appeal can be decided on a principled basis without discussing the scope of ERISA pre-emption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority purports to \"express no opinion on the preemption issue,\" and suggests that the plaintiff could still pursue her claim against Kaplan by seeking to amend her pending ERISA complaint so as to add Kaplan as a defendant.  The majority fails to recognize, however, that the practical effect of its disposition of the case is to uphold the district court's pre-emption ruling sub silentio, and to leave the plaintiff with no recourse in any forum.  A finding of no preemption results in dismissal of the claim for lack of federal jurisdiction and leaves the plaintiff free to seek redress in state court.  In contrast, the majority's refusal to address the merits of the district court's pre-emption ruling is not only analytically unsound, it also leaves the plaintiff exactly where she started--with her state-court action subject to removal to federal court on the ground of pre-emption and with pre-emption as a bar to recourse in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons that follow, I conclude that ERISA does not pre-empt plaintiff's misrepresentation claim against Kaplan and that, therefore, the proper disposition of this case would be to deny plaintiff's motion for lack of federal jurisdiction over the purported state-law claim, leaving the plaintiff free to pursue the claim in the state court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I start my analysis with the key words of the statute bearing on pre-emption:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan ....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this section:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>(1) The term \"State law\" includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law, of any State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court teaches that the pre-emption provision of &#167; 514(a), codified at 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a), was intended</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of benefits law;  the goal was to minimize the administrative and financial burden of complying with conflicting directives among States or between States and the Federal Government.

And yet, despite the variety of these opportunities for federal preeminence, we have never assumed lightly that Congress has derogated state regulation, but instead have addressed claims of pre-emption with the starting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law.  Indeed, in cases like this one, where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation, we have worked on the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1676 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

The question of ERISA pre-emption is reviewed de novo.  See Degnan v. Publicker Indus., Inc., 83 F.3d at 28-29.   I recognize that the standard of review for a district court's refusal to allow an amendment to the complaint is abuse of discretion.  This standard is not applicable here, however, because the root issue--stated by the district court as the basis for its decision--is ERISA pre-emption, a question of law.  See Carlo v. Reed Rolled Thread Die Co., 49 F.3d at 792-93.   Moreover, if there is no pre-emption, the federal courts are bereft of jurisdiction.  Thus, in my view, there is no way of avoiding the pre-emption issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normally in a pre-emption case the starting point is an examination of the facts, but there is not much in the way of facts here.  All we know is derived from the allegations in the purported amended complaint, which must be accepted as true at this stage of the litigation.  These allegations can only be construed as stating that Kaplan made misrepresentations to plaintiff's husband, Donald Golas, and/or failed to give him correct information about the conditions of eligibility for participation in the Revere Insurance policy.  The amended complaint alleges that Kaplan was an insurance broker.  I take that to mean that she \"sold\" Revere's insurance policy to HomeView.  Although Kaplan is linked to HomeView and Revere as to the alleged misrepresentations, there is no claim that Kaplan acted as agent for or on behalf of either or both of the other two defendants.  The amended complaint, broadly construed, alleges a common-law misrepresentation claim against Kaplan individually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Strictly speaking, the ERISA disability insurance plan is not implicated in plaintiff's misrepresentation claim.  Donald Golas never became a covered employee;  instead, the complaint focuses on the alleged misrepresentations which plaintiff alleges were the cause of Golas's being excluded from insurance coverage.  Neither the extent of insurance coverage nor the amount of benefits is involved.  Even the eligibility requirements themselves are not in dispute;  it is only the alleged misrepresentations about those eligibility requirements that give rise to plaintiff's cause of action.  Plaintiff's burden of proof thus goes to whether her husband would have been eligible to join the plan if Kaplan had not made misrepresentations as to his eligibility.  See Coyne &amp; Delany Co., 98 F.3d at 1462 n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is markedly different from Carlo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691308\"><a href=\"/opinion/691308/pens-plan-guide-p-23907e-victor-e-carlo-jr-and-kathleen-m-carlo-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span>.   In Carlo, the plaintiff was a former employee of defendant Reed and a participant in its retirement plan.  Plaintiff Carlo elected early retirement on the basis of monthly benefits he was told he would receive.  The actual monthly benefits he received were twenty percent less than the amount promised him.  Defendant apologized for the error and offered to let him continue working at the same position.  Carlo did not accept the offer and took early retirement under protest.  He subsequently brought suit in Massachusetts state court for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation.

Here, by contrast, Donald Golas was not a covered employee and none of the issues implicate the substantive provisions of the insurance plan.  The allegations are solely concerned with misrepresentations regarding Golas's eligibility to become a covered employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The analysis used in Boston Children's Heart Found. v.

The suit alleged that defendant breached his fiduciary duty by misappropriating plaintiff's funds.  The basis of the suit was defendant's failure to disclose to the other directors of the corporation important information concerning provisions of a severance-benefit plan (the Banks Plan) he had devised.  When the plan was terminated on defendant's initiative, he received more than $4,000,000 in severance benefits.  On appeal defendant contended that ERISA specifically exempted the type of severance benefits plan at issue from its fiduciary duty provisions and pre-empted the application of state fiduciary law.  73 F.3d at 438.   We held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>Here, the alleged breach of fiduciary duty relates to Nadal-Ginard's action in establishing the Banks Plan without disclosing information that a self-interested fiduciary would be required to reveal to his fellow directors.  Nadal-Ginard's misconduct preceded the formal adoption of the plan.  The legal determination that Nadal-Ginard's conduct constitutes a fiduciary breach does not require the resolution of any dispute about the interpretation or administration of the plan.  Further, the application of state law in this instance does not raise the core concern underlying ERISA preemption.   Indeed, the fact that Nadal-Ginard chose an ERISA plan rather than some other form of compensation is peripheral to the underlying claim that Nadal-Ginard breached his corporate responsibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This being the case, it cannot be said that Massachusetts fiduciary law must be preempted in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 440 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon our own circuit cases, the restriction of the scope of pre-emption under &#167; 514(a) of the statute established in Travelers, and the post-Travelers cases in other circuits, it is evident that ERISA does not pre-empt the misrepresentation claim against Ellen Kaplan.  There are eight reasons, gleaned from the cited cases, for this conclusion.  (1) No ERISA benefits are sought and no ERISA rights or obligations are asserted.  (2) Defendant Kaplan would be personally responsible for any money damages awarded to plaintiff.  (3) Defendant Kaplan is not an ERISA entity, nor does the alleged misrepresentation claim affect the relationship between ERISA entities.  (4) None of the three categories of state laws that Travelers holds Congress intended to pre-empt are implicated.  (5) The common-law claim of misrepresentation is a state law of general application.  Moreover, tort law in general is traditionally an area of state regulation.  It is therefore unlikely that Congress intended to intrude into this area by pre-emption.  (6) Congress did not intend to shield tortfeasors from liability for misrepresentation where ERISA benefits, rights, obligations, and core concerns are not implicated.  (7) State common law imposes a duty of care relative to representations made by insurance professionals which does not in any way depend upon ERISA.  (8) The alleged misrepresentation occurred prior to the time when the ERISA plan would have taken effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would hold, therefore, that the district court committed reversible error in denying plaintiff's motion to amend on the ground that the claim raised therein \"would be pre-empted by ERISA.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Because ERISA does not pre-empt the claim asserted against Ellen Kaplan, and because there is no diversity of citizenship between the parties, nor any other basis for federal jurisdiction, the motion should have been denied for lack of federal jurisdiction.  Plaintiff should be left to pursue her misrepresentation claim against Kaplan in the Massachusetts state courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the majority and I agree on the ultimate result, we disagree as to the proper path to take in reaching it.  Because I think that this is a case in which the procedural path is important, I must respectfully concur, rather than join the majority opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> HomeView made its own motion to dismiss some three months later, incorporating by reference Paul Revere's arguments in support</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The concurrence argues that the ERISA issue must be reached because issues of jurisdiction must be addressed first and, in the absence of diversity, there is no other basis for federal jurisdiction.  This is incorrect.  We disagree with the premise that the court could not address the motion to amend without first addressing the ERISA issue.  Second, even if the claim against Kaplan were not preempted by ERISA, the district court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the claim, because the other two state law claims had properly been before the district court.  In any civil action over which the district courts have original jurisdiction, they also have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that form part of the same case or controversy.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367.  The district court had jurisdiction over the state law claims against Paul Revere and HomeView under the complete preemption doctrine.  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.

In Kaplan's deposition testimony attached to Golas' brief, Kaplan states that she held an employee benefits meeting for HomeView employees to explain the Paul Revere disability policy and an Aetna insurance policy that was also being offered to HomeView employees.  This undermines Golas' argument that Kaplan was an independent broker.  The facts may by now be established, but no findings are before us.  However, if Kaplan was an agent of either of the two companies, the factual assumption underlying the concurrence is incorrect, and the resulting legal conclusions unjustified.  Indeed, if Kaplan is an agent of HomeView, the case would fall squarely within the ambit of Vartanian v. Monsanto Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195179\"><a href=\"/opinion/195179/vartanian-v-monsanto-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> I, of course, intimate no opinion as to the merits of plaintiff's state-law claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> I would also hold that the district court erred in adopting the magistrate's recommendation, without considering the application of ERISA to Kaplan as an individual, in light of the differences between her status vis-a-vis ERISA and that of the other defendants.  Instead, the magistrate merely said, \"For the reason stated ... [regarding Paul Revere and HomeView] ...,\" plaintiff's claim against Kaplan would also \"be pre-empted by ERISA.\"   He simply assumed that, if ERISA pre-empted the claim against Revere and HomeView, it must likewise pre-empt the claim against Kaplan.  Given the distinctions between Kaplan's status as an ERISA entity and that of the other defendants, this failure to consider the claim against Kaplan on its own merit also constituted legal error</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
