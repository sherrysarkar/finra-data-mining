Kelli Swain was subjected to\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\na strip search and visual body cavity inspection, while being\r\n\nheld in  a cell  in the  North Reading,  Massachusetts police\r\n\nstation.   This search occurred  after Swain had  been in the\r\n\ncell for twenty  minutes, and more than an hour after she was\r\n\narrested.  She was arrested with her boyfriend as a result of\r\n\nhis  shoplifting; she  was  suspected of  having possessed  a\r\n\nsmall baggie of marijuana.  The search was ordered, she says,\r\n\nby  a police  officer immediately  after he  had interrogated\r\n\nher,  while knowing she was  represented by counsel.   He had\r\n\nbecome angry with Swain for saying she knew nothing about her\r\n\nboyfriend's shoplifting.  Swain's  boyfriend, who was also in\r\n\ncustody, whose shoplifting had triggered the arrests, and who\r\n\nhad an extensive criminal  record, including drug crimes, was\r\n\nnot  strip-searched.     The  charges   against  Swain   were\r\n\neventually nol prossed.\r\n\n          Swain brought suit under 42 U.S.C.   1983 and Mass.\r\n\nGen.  Laws  ch. 12,     11H,  11I,  alleging that  the search\r\n\nhumiliated  her and  caused  lasting emotional  damage.   The\r\n\ndistrict court  granted summary judgment for  the defendants.\r\n\nThe court held that  there were no material facts  in dispute\r\n\nwhich would support  Swain's claims that  the search was  not\r\n\nreasonable under  the Fourth Amendment and  that the officers\r\n\nwere not entitled to immunity.   We hold that, as  alleged by\r\n\nSwain, a jury could find that the search was not justified by\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\na reasonable suspicion,  and that  the jury  should have  the\r\n\nopportunity to resolve the  factual disputes pertinent to the\r\n\nissue  of   whether  the   officers  were  entitled   to  the\r\n\nprotections of qualified immunity.   Swain fails, however, to\r\n\nmeet the  exacting standards for municipal  liability under  \r\n\n1983, even on  her version  of the facts.   Accordingly,  the\r\n\njudgment of the district court with respect to the individual\r\n\ndefendants is reversed, but the grant of  summary judgment as\r\n\nto the Town of North Reading is affirmed.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          We  review the facts in the light most favorable to\r\n\nSwain, the party opposing summary judgment.  On May 18, 1993,\r\n\nKelli  Swain and  her  boyfriend,  Christopher Milbury,  went\r\n\napartment hunting in the Danvers, Massachusetts area.  Around\r\n\n10:00  a.m., after the couple  had been driving  for a little\r\n\nwhile,  Milbury told  Swain that  he needed  to pick  up some\r\n\nthings at Moynihan  Lumber.   Swain waited in  the car  while\r\n\nMilbury went into the  store; he was gone about  ten minutes.\r\n\nWhen Milbury got back,  he placed a bag  behind the seat  and\r\n\nstarted to leave the parking  lot.  As they drove out  of the\r\n\nparking lot, Swain saw  Moynihan Lumber employees pointing at\r\n\nthe car; she  also saw a police cruiser pulling  into the lot\r\n\njust as she and Milbury were pulling out.\r\n\n          Swain  became very  upset.   She  began questioning\r\n\nMilbury about what was going on.  Then, after they had driven\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n200  or  300  yards,  the  police  cruiser,  which  had  been\r\n\nfollowing the  couple since  the parking lot,  turned on  its\r\n\nblue lights  and its  siren; Milbury  pulled their  car over.\r\n\nOfficer Robert  Marchionda then  approached  the vehicle  and\r\n\nMilbury got out of the car.  Swain remained in the  car for a\r\n\nminute or two,  and then got out  when she saw Milbury  being\r\n\nhandcuffed.   As  Swain  got out,  she  dropped a  baggie  of\r\n\nmarijuana on the ground  about three feet away from  the car.\r\n\nOfficer Marchionda  had seen Swain  put her hands  behind her\r\n\nback and  drop an object  onto the grass,  but could not,  at\r\n\nthat point, identify the  object.  Officer Marchionda radioed\r\n\nfor backup, and another  officer, Officer Romeo, arrived soon\r\n\nthereafter.   Swain  then  approached the  officers, but  was\r\n\nstopped  by one of them,  who restrained her  with his hands.\r\n\nShe asked what  was going on,  and was told that  Milbury was\r\n\nsuspected  of taking  things from  Moynihan Lumber.   Officer\r\n\nMarchionda then arrested Swain and handcuffed her.   While he\r\n\nwas handcuffing her,  he saw  that the dropped  object was  a\r\n\nbaggie of marijuana.  He retrieved it.  Swain was pat frisked\r\n\nat the scene, but nothing was found on her person.\r\n\n           When the police searched  the car, they found $400\r\n\nworth of hardware  in the  trunk, which had  been taken  from\r\n\nanother store in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and  another $400\r\n\nworth of  sawblades, wrapped in  a hardware flyer,  under the\r\n\nfront  seat.   Swain  was  surprised to  see  the merchandise\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthere.   The  police implied  that she  was an  accomplice to\r\n\nMilbury's  theft;  she kept  saying  that  she  did not  know\r\n\nanything about it.   Milbury also told the police  that Swain\r\n\nwas innocent.\r\n\n          Neither of  the officers  ever asked her  about the\r\n\nmarijuana on the  ground.  Swain did  not see anyone pick  up\r\n\nthe marijuana and did  not know if  anyone had seen her  drop\r\n\nit.\r\n\n           After about thirty minutes at the scene, Swain and\r\n\nMilbury were transported  in a  police cruiser  to the  North\r\n\nReading Police Station.   When  she got to  the station,  her\r\n\nhandcuffs  were removed.  Swain was seated at a booking desk,\r\n\nand an  officer had  her sign  a rights card.   Matron  Laura\r\n\nSpinney, the chief  of police's secretary, was  called to the\r\n\nbooking desk because a female was under arrest.\r\n\n          While in the booking area, Swain asked to go to the\r\n\nbathroom.   Matron Spinney escorted  her to a  bathroom,  but\r\n\ndid not  come in with  her.  Swain  was allowed to  close the\r\n\ndoor almost all of  the way, leaving it  open just a  little.\r\n\nSpinney stood outside the  door to the room, where  she could\r\n\nhear Swain using the facilities, but could not see Swain.  \r\n\nSwain  then returned to the  booking area, and  was told that\r\n\nshe  could  make a  phone call.   She  was  shown to  a small\r\n\noffice, and a police  officer stood outside.  She  called her\r\n\nattorney and spoke with him for five to ten minutes.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          While  Swain was  seated in  the booking  area, her\r\n\npocketbook was searched by  Spinney.  Spinney found cigarette\r\n\nrolling papers  in the  pocketbook.   No one  discussed these\r\n\npapers  with Swain.    At that  point,  one of  the  officers\r\n\nadvised  Swain that marijuana had been found at the scene and\r\n\nthat  she  was going  to be  charged  in connection  with it.\r\n\nSwain denied that it was her marijuana. \r\n\n          Swain  was  then  fingerprinted  and  photographed.\r\n\nOfficer  Ed  Hayes,  the  prosecuting  officer and  detective\r\n\ndepartment supervisor,  ordered Matron Spinney  to take Swain\r\n\nto a  cell.  Spinney pat  frisked Swain before taking  her to\r\n\nthe cell and  found nothing on her.  Swain  was left alone in\r\n\nthe  cell  for about  twenty  minutes.   According  to Swain,\r\n\nSergeant  Hayes  then  came  to her  cell  and  attempted  to\r\n\nquestion  her  about Milbury's  criminal  activities.   Hayes\r\n\nyelled at Swain, telling her that she was lying, and that she\r\n\nshould tell him  what was going  on.   Swain, who was  crying\r\n\nhysterically, kept repeating that she honestly knew nothing. \r\n\nAccording to Swain,  Hayes' questioning lasted  approximately\r\n\nfifteen minutes and then he \"walked out in a huff.\"\r\n\n          Hayes states that he only  stayed with Swain in the\r\n\ncell  area   for  approximately  one  minute.     He  has  no\r\n\nrecollection  of what  he discussed  with Swain,  but asserts\r\n\nthat  it would  be  normal  procedure  for  him  to  talk  to\r\n\ndetainees  to advise them about  their arraignments.  He does\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nnot  recall interrogating  Swain about  Milbury's activities,\r\n\nbut cannot state  that he did not  do so.    Milbury, who was\r\n\nlocated  in  another cell  where he  could  hear but  not see\r\n\nSwain, stated that  he heard  Hayes talking to  her and  also\r\n\nheard Swain crying and saying that she was innocent.\r\n\n          About five  to ten minutes after  Hayes' departure,\r\n\nSpinney returned and apologetically informed Swain that Hayes\r\n\nhad  ordered her  to  strip  search  Swain.    It  is  Hayes'\r\n\ntestimony  that he  believes  he would  have  ordered such  a\r\n\nsearch prior to speaking  with Swain.  Spinney does  not know\r\n\nwhether  the search was  ordered before or  after Hayes spoke\r\n\nwith Swain, but knows that Hayes did not order a strip search\r\n\nwhen  he originally told Spinney  to take Swain  to the cell.\r\n\nSpinney states, however, that the  order to strip search came\r\n\nalmost  immediately after she brought Swain  to the cell, and\r\n\nnot a significant amount of time later.  \r\n\n          Swain  could  not  understand  why  she  was  being\r\n\nsearched and  began crying again. Spinney  then ordered Swain\r\n\nto remove all of  her clothing except for  her bra.   Spinney\r\n\nshook out  each item as Swain took it off.  Spinney then made\r\n\nSwain  bend over  and spread  her buttocks.   Swain  was very\r\n\nupset and shaking uncontrollably the entire time.   Swain was\r\n\nthen  told she  could  get dressed.    Spinney found  nothing\r\n\nduring  her  search.   The  entire  procedure lasted  fifteen\r\n\nminutes.   Hayes had not told  Spinney what to look  for, but\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nSpinney  knew that marijuana had been found at the scene, and\r\n\nassumed that she was looking for drugs. \r\n\n          Swain asserts that, before  she was asked to strip,\r\n\nSpinney  assured Swain that the video camera in the cell area\r\n\nwas already off. Swain did not  see her turn the camera  off.\r\n\nChief of  Police Henry  Purnell testified, however,  that the\r\n\nstation cameras, including  the one in  the female cell,  are\r\n\nconstantly left on.  Videotapes are sometimes made from these\r\n\ncameras,  but the  Department has  no policies  or procedures\r\n\nconcerning the making, storage,  or retention of these tapes.\r\n\nMatrons  are  instructed to  turn  the  cell  camera off,  by\r\n\npressing a button, when conducting  a search.  Spinney states\r\n\nthat  she turned  the camera  off with  a wall  switch before\r\n\nsearching Swain, but  does not recall telling  Swain that the\r\n\ncamera was off  or making  any comments about  the camera  at\r\n\nall. \r\n\n          Milbury, who had an extensive criminal record,  was\r\n\nnever strip searched.   Hayes was aware of Milbury's  history\r\n\nof drug convictions and  knew that Milbury was  on probation,\r\n\nhaving pulled the  records while booking Milbury.   Swain had\r\n\nno prior criminal convictions.\r\n\n          Officer  Hayes,  for his  part,  tells  a different\r\n\nstory.  He asserts that he ordered the strip  search of Swain\r\n\nimmediately  upon  his arrival  at  the  booking desk,  which\r\n\noccurred as soon as he was informed that the arrests had been\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nmade,  and, he believes, before he spoke with her.  According\r\n\nto Hayes, he ordered the search because the arresting officer\r\n\nshowed  him the marijuana and  informed him that  Swain was a\r\n\nprincipal suspect  in a narcotics incident.   He also asserts\r\n\nthat  he  suspected Swain  of  carrying  a concealed  weapon,\r\n\nalthough  he   acknowledges  that  this  was   a  generalized\r\n\nsuspicion  of narcotics  suspects,  rather  than a  suspicion\r\n\nbased on any characteristics of Swain.\r\n\n          Later that day, Milbury and Swain were arraigned in\r\n\nWoburn District Court and released on their own recognizance.\r\n\nAll charges  against Swain  were eventually \"nol  prossed\" or\r\n\ncontinued  without a  finding.    Swain  suffered  continuing\r\n\nemotional  trauma  as  a  result  of  the  search  and sought\r\n\ncounseling.     \r\n\n          The  Town  of  North  Reading's   policy  on  strip\r\n\nsearches is outlined  in a memo on \"Inventory Search Policy,\"\r\n\nprepared in 1989 by training officer Lieutenant Edward Nolan.\r\n\nThe  Policy states that: \"A  strip search of  the arrestee is\r\n\nwarranted only if the  police have probable cause  to believe\r\n\nthat  the arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons on his\r\n\nbody.\"  Chief Purnell testified that, in any arrest involving\r\n\ndrugs, all arrestees are strip searched.  The shift commander\r\n\n-- normally the highest-ranking officer  on duty -- makes the\r\n\ndetermination of when a strip search is warranted. \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          The Municipal Police  Institute (MPI), a  statewide\r\n\npolice  association, publishes a  book called \"Police Manual:\r\n\nPolicies  &amp; Procedures.\"   Chief  Purnell testified  that the\r\n\nNorth  Reading  police  adhere  to  the  MPI  policies.   The\r\n\nrelevant MPI policy is as follows:\r\n\n          A   strip  search   of  an   arrestee  is\r\n          warranted    only   if    officers   have\r\n          reasonable suspicion to believe  that the\r\n          arrestee  is   concealing  contraband  or\r\n          weapons on his body.\r\n\n          1.   All body strip-searches must  be approved\r\n               by   the  officer-in-charge,   who  shall\r\n               consider the following question:\r\n\n                    Is  the crime  one that  is normally\r\n                    associated    with    weapons     or\r\n                    contraband?\r\n\n               Only if  the answer  to this  question is\r\n               yes and  there is a  reasonable suspicion\r\n               that   the   arrestee   has  weapons   or\r\n               contraband  on his  person  will  a  body\r\n               strip-search be authorized.\r\n\n          2.   Body  cavity  searches   should  not   be\r\n               conducted    without the express approval\r\n               of the officer-in-charge,  and require  a\r\n               search warrant signed by a judge.     \r\n\nHowever,  both  Sergeant Hayes  and Matron  Spinney testified\r\n\nthat they were unaware that North Reading had any policy with\r\n\nregard  to strip searches.   Hayes testified that  it was his\r\n\npolicy  to strip  search individuals whenever  narcotics were\r\n\ninvolved in the case.  Nonetheless, he  did not order a strip\r\n\nsearch of Milbury.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          Swain claims, under 42 U.S.C.   1983 and Mass. Gen.\r\n\nLaws ch. 12,     11H, 11I, that Laura Spinney,  Edward Hayes,\r\n\nand the Town of  North Reading violated her rights  under the\r\n\nUnited States and  Massachusetts Constitutions by  subjecting\r\n\nher to  an unreasonable  search.   On defendants'  motion for\r\n\nsummary judgment, the district  court held that, under United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Klein, 522 F.2d 296 (1st Cir. 1975), the search  of\r                           \r\n\nSwain  was within  the bounds  of the  Fourth Amendment.   It\r\n\nthought  Klein unaffected  by Bell  v. Wolfish, 441  U.S. 520\r                                                          \r\n\n(1979).  The district court further  held that the individual\r\n\ndefendants were, in any event, entitled to qualified immunity\r\n\nfrom suit.   As to  the Massachusetts law  claims, the  court\r\n\nfound that,  in this  area, Massachusetts  constitutional law\r\n\ntracked the  federal standards.  Finally,  the district court\r\n\nfound that  Swain had failed  to meet the  exacting standards\r\n\nfor municipal liability under   1983.\r\n\n          Swain argues  on appeal  that the police  must have\r\n\nprobable  cause to  believe  that an  arrestee is  concealing\r\n\nweapons or contraband in order to strip search that arrestee.\r\n\nShe further argues that, even if the search needed only to be\r\n\nsupported by  a reasonable  suspicion, no such  suspicion was\r\n\npresent  and that the officers  are thus not  entitled to the\r\n\nprotections of qualified immunity. \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          We  review  the district  court's grant  of summary\r\n\njudgment  de novo.

Because  a jury  could find  that  Officer Hayes\r\n\nacted  without  a   reasonable  suspicion   that  Swain   was\r\n\nconcealing  drugs or weapons, we find that Swain has stated a\r\n\nclaim  against  the   individual  defendants  sufficient   to\r\n\nwithstand a motion for  summary judgment.  Furthermore, while\r\n\nsome  courts have  suggested that  a higher  standard may  be\r                                                       \r\n\nnecessary to justify  a strip search  and visual body  cavity\r\n\ninspection, it  was clearly  established at  the time  of the\r\n\nsearch  that  the  Fourth   Amendment  requires  at  least  a\r                                                                      \r\n\nreasonable suspicion  to  conduct these  types  of  searches.\r\n\nSignificant factual disputes remain, rendering  it impossible\r\n\nto  resolve  conclusively the  immunity  question on  summary\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\nA.

Rather, the evaluation of the constitutionality\r               \r\n\nof a warrantless search\r\n\n          requires a balancing of the need  for the\r\n          particular search against the invasion of\r\n          personal rights that the  search entails.\r\n          Courts  must  consider the  scope  of the\r\n          particular intrusion, the manner in which\r\n          it  is  conducted, the  justification for\r\n          initiating it,  and the place in which it\r\n          is conducted.\r\n\nId.   In Wolfish,  the Supreme  Court applied this  balancing\r                            \r\n\ntest  to a  prison policy  that required  arraigned pre-trial\r\n\ndetainees  to   \"expose  their   body  cavities  for   visual\r\n\ninspection  as a part of a strip search conducted after every\r\n\ncontact visit  with a  person from outside  the institution.\"\r\n\nId. at 558.

The Search of Swain\r                                  \r\n\n          Turning  to  the  particular search  at  issue,  we\r\n\nconclude, taking all the facts in the light most favorable to\r\n\nSwain,   that  a  jury   could  find  that   the  search  was\r\n\nunreasonable   and  thus   violated  the   Fourth  Amendment.\r\n\nAccordingly,  we find  that  Swain has  stated a  trialworthy\r\n\nclaim under 42 U.S.C.   1983.   On these facts, there appears\r\n\nto be the distinct possibility that Officer Hayes ordered the\r\n\nstrip search  in retaliation for his  failed interrogation of\r\n\nSwain  in her cell, imposing  sexual humiliation on  her as a\r\n\npunishment  for  what he  perceived  as  her non-cooperation.\r\n\nHayes'  angry  response  to  Swain's  inability   to  provide\r\n\ninformation about Milbury's activities  and the timing of the\r\n\nsearch  raise this inference.  This possibility distinguishes\r\n\nthis  case from Klein, where  the court found  that there was\r                                 \r\n\n\"no evidence that the stripping was a pretext to humiliate or\r\n\ndegrade.\"  Klein, 522 F.2d at 300.2  We  must   thus  examine\r                            \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  We also recognize that, under United States v. Whren, 116\r                                                                    \r\nS. Ct. 1769 (1996), a police officer's subjective motivations\r\ndo not  serve to  invalidate a  search for  exclusionary rule\r\npurposes, so  long as  the search was  objectively reasonable\r\nunder the circumstances.   Whren, however, also stressed that\r                                            \r\n\"the Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the  law\r\nbased on considerations such  as race,\" id. at 1774,  and, we\r                                                       \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nwhether, on these facts, an objective  officer would have had\r\n\na  reasonable suspicion  that Swain  was concealing  drugs or\r\n\ncontraband on her  person.  Three factors  suggest that there\r\n\nwere  not adequate  grounds to justify  the strip  and visual\r\n\nbody cavity search of Swain.   First, there is the timing  of\r\n\nthe search.  Swain had been alone in the cell for some period\r\n\nof  time  before  she was  searched  and  no  one thought  it\r\n\nimportant to  search  her before  she  angered Hayes  by  not\r\n\ngiving  him   the  information  he  sought.     Perhaps  more\r\n\nimportantly,  she had been allowed  to go to  the bathroom by\r\n\nherself,  unobserved, prior to being taken to her cell.  This\r\n\nalso  indicates that no one thought she had secreted drugs in\r\n\nher  private parts.    Cf. Burns,  907  F.2d at  238  (common\r                                            \r\n\nknowledge  that  drug  users   and  dealers  with  controlled\r\n\nsubstances on their persons often attempt to flush drugs down\r\n\nthe  toilet).  If a warrantless strip search may be justified\r\n\nby the need to avoid  the destruction of concealed  evidence,\r\n\nSwain already had had  ample opportunity to destroy any  such\r\n\nevidence.  To the extent there was any reason to believe such\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nwould assume, gender.   The exclusionary rule, as the Supreme\r\nCourt  recognized in  Malley  v. Briggs,  475  U.S. 335,  344\r                                                   \r\n(1986), balances different interests than  those in a    1983\r\naction.  (\"While  we believe the  exclusionary rule serves  a\r\nnecessary  purpose, it  obviously does  so at  a considerable\r\ncost  to the society as a whole, because it excludes evidence\r\nprobative  of guilt.  . .  .   On the  other hand,  a damages\r\nremedy  for [a  Fourth  Amendment violation]  imposes a  cost\r\ndirectly on the officer  responsible . . ., without  the side\r\neffect of hampering a criminal prosecution.\").\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nevidence  still existed,  further delay  to obtain  a warrant\r\n\nwould  not   have   significantly  increased   the  risk   of\r\n\ndestruction.   This was  particularly true because  Swain was\r\n\nkept under observation and recorded by video camera while  in\r\n\nthe holding cell.\r\n\n          Second, as noted, the most compelling justification\r\n\nfor  warrantless strip  and  visual body  cavity searches  is\r\n\ninstitutional security.  It  is uncontroverted that, prior to\r\n\nher  arraignment, Swain  was the  only person in  the women's\r\n\nholding  cell  of  the North  Reading  Police  Station.   Her\r\n\narraignment  was later the  same afternoon, and  she was then\r\n\nreleased,  on her own recognizance.   There was  no risk that\r\n\nshe  would come into contact with other prisoners, or be able\r\n\nto smuggle  contraband or weapons into  a secure environment.\r\n\nHayes  stated that  he  believed that  Swain, as  a narcotics\r\n\nsuspect,  might have been carrying  a concealed weapon but he\r\n\ndid not assert  that Swain posed  a threat  to his safety  or\r\n\nthat of  others in  the police  station.   The  institutional\r\n\nsecurity justification  thus appears  to be absent  from this\r\n\ncase.  \r\n\n          Third, there  is the differential treatment  by the\r\n\npolice  of  the young  woman and  her  boyfriend.   Swain and\r\n\nMilbury   were  first  pulled   over  because   of  Milbury's\r\n\nshoplifting activities.  Officer  Hayes stated that, prior to\r\n\nsearching Swain,  he had examined both  Swain's and Milbury's\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nrecords. Officer Hayes knew that Milbury was on probation and\r\n\nhad  a history of drug  convictions.  By  contrast, Swain did\r\n\nnot  have a  criminal  record.   Milbury  had told  officers,\r\n\nincluding Hayes, that the marijuana was his.  Yet Milbury was\r\n\nnot strip searched.  If there was an objective basis -- apart\r\n\nfrom  retaliation -- for stripping Swain,  it would have been\r\n\nobjectively  reasonable, and  more so,  to search  Milbury as\r\n\nwell.\r\n\n          On  the other  hand,  Swain did  drop  a baggie  of\r\n\nmarijuana at the scene of the crime.  Officer Hayes expressed\r\n\nthe view (belied by his failure to strip search Milbury) that\r\n\na strip search was  justified whenever narcotics are involved\r\n\nin  the case.   This is  not consistent with  either the Town\r\n\npolicy,  which requires  probable cause,  or the  MPI policy,\r\n\nwhich requires an  individualized suspicion,  even where  the\r\n\ncrime involves contraband  or weapons.   The record does  not\r\n\nreveal  how much marijuana  was in the  baggie Swain dropped,\r\n\nnor  does  it  reveal   whether  possession  of  that  amount\r\n\nconstitutes  a misdemeanor  or a  felony  under Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw.  Nothing in the record suggests that Swain was suspected\r\n\nof being a distributor of marijuana.  The fact that Swain may\r\n\nhave possessed  some unspecified  amount of marijuana  is not\r\n\nenough  to  overcome,  as  a  matter  of  law,  the  factors,\r\n\ndiscussed  above, under which a jury could find the search of\r\n\nSwain unreasonable.\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          Accordingly,  we  hold that  a jury  could lawfully\r\n\nfind that there was no objectively reasonable basis for strip\r\n\nsearching  Swain and that, on these facts, Swain has stated a\r\n\nclaim  for violation of her Fourth Amendment right to be free\r\n\nfrom  unreasonable searches that  survives defendants' motion\r\n\nfor summary judgment.\r\n\nC. Qualified Immunity\r                                 \r\n\n          Defendants  assert  that they  are,  in  any event,\r\n\nentitled to  qualified immunity  from suit.    There are  two\r\n\nprongs  to the  qualified immunity  analysis. First,  was the\r\n\nconstitutional right in  question clearly established  at the\r\n\ntime  of the alleged violation?   St. Hilaire  v. Laconia, 71\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 20, 24  (1st Cir. 1995).  That is a  question of law for\r\n\nthe  court.   Elder v.  Holloway, 510  U.S. 510,  516 (1994).\r                                            \r\n\nSecond,  would  a  reasonable,  similarly  situated  official\r\n\nunderstand   that  the   challenged  conduct   violated  that\r\n\nestablished right?  St. Hilaire, 71 F.3d at 24.  \r                                           \r\n\n          The  Fourth  Amendment   right  to  be   free  from\r\n\nunreasonable strip searches has long been clearly established\r\n\nin this circuit, as elsewhere.   See Burns, 907 F.2d at  236;\r                                                      \r\n\nBlackburn,  771 F.2d at 569 (\"It can hardly be debated that .\r                     \r\n\n.  .  in 1977,  [there  was] a  'clearly  established' Fourth\r\n\nAmendment right to  be free of unreasonable  searches.\").  As\r\n\ndiscussed  above, Klein's  holding  that such  a search  is a\r                                   \r\n\nreasonable search  incident to  arrest had been  abrogated by\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nsubsequent  Supreme Court  and First  Circuit cases,  and had\r\n\nbeen  squarely  rejected  by  the  other  circuit  courts  to\r\n\nconsider the issue.

Here,  some   material  facts  are\r\n\nsignificantly in dispute.  Swain's story and that  of Officer\r\n\nHayes conflict on   the timing of the relevant  events.  Some\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nproffers are supported  or contradicted  by other  witnesses,\r\n\nincluding Spinney and  Milbury.  Hayes contends that,  as the\r\n\nofficer in charge of the investigation, he ordered the search\r\n\nimmediately  upon being  informed that a  narcotics violation\r\n\nhad occurred.  The timing of  when the search was ordered  is\r\n\nessential to  a determination of whether  defendants' conduct\r\n\nwas objectively  reasonable. There  are thus  factual issues,\r\n\npotentially turning on credibility,  that must be resolved by\r\n\nthe  trier of  fact.   Only  after  the resolution  of  these\r\n\nconflicts  may  the trial  court  apply the  relevant  law on\r\n\nobjective reasonableness.3 \r\n\n          We   also  recognize   that  police   officers  are\r\n\nprotected  in  close  cases  by  the  doctrine  of  qualified\r\n\nimmunity, and that immunity serves to protect law enforcement\r\n\nfrom  the chilling  threat of  liability.

On the facts as\r                    \r\n\nrelated  by Swain,  Officer  Hayes used  a warrantless  strip\r\n\nsearch  and  visual body  cavity  inspection  as  a  tool  to\r\n\nhumiliate and degrade her in  retaliation for her refusal  to\r\n\nrespond to interrogation.\r\n\n          Independently  of the  issue  of  allegations  that\r\n\nOfficer  Hayes  deliberately violated  the  law  in order  to\r\n\nretaliate,  as forbidden  by Malley,  Swain also  asserts the\r                                               \r\n\nsearch is not,  on its facts,  objectively reasonable.   This\r\n\nsearch, on Swain's allegations,  occurred after she had ample\r\n\nopportunity to  dispose of any  hidden evidence and  when she\r\n\nwas alone in  a monitored  cell, posing no  danger to  others\r\n\nthat  might justify  hastily  proceeding without  a  warrant.\r\n\nSuch allegations,  if true, do  not represent a  \"close case\"\r\n\nbut a flagrant violation  of the Fourth Amendment's guarantee\r\n\nagainst unreasonable searches.  Whether those allegations are\r\n\ntrue or not must be resolved by the finder of fact.  \r\n\nD. Municipal Liability\r                                  \r\n\n          Swain  claims that  the  Town of  North Reading  is\r\n\nliable for the injuries that she suffered.

The plaintiff must\r\n          also   demonstrate   that,  through   its\r\n          deliberate conduct,  the municipality was\r\n          the  \"moving  force\"  behind  the  injury\r\n          alleged.   That is, a plaintiff must show\r\n          that  the municipal action was taken with\r\n          the requisite degree  of culpability  and\r\n          must  demonstrate  a  direct causal  link\r\n          between  the  municipal  action  and  the\r\n          deprivation of federal rights.\r\n\nBoard of the County Comm'rs  v.

This failure  to train, Swain alleges, rose\r\n\nto the level of  conscious indifference to the constitutional\r\n\nrights of arrestees.  Swain accurately notes that the various\r\n\npolice personnel, including the  police chief, expressed some\r\n\nconfusion as to when strip searches are warranted.  \r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\n          The Supreme Court addressed failure to train claims\r\n\nin Brown:\r                    \r\n\n          We   concluded   in   Canton    that   an\r                                                  \r\n          \"inadequate training\" claim could  be the\r\n          basis  for    1983 liability  in \"limited\r\n          circumstances.\"  We  spoke, however, of a\r\n          deficient training \"program,\" necessarily\r\n          intended to apply  over time to  multiple\r\n          employees.    Existence  of  a  \"program\"\r\n          makes proof of fault at least possible in\r\n          an   inadequate  training  case.

There    was thus  \"no  notice to  the  municipal\r\n\ndecisionmaker,  based  on  previous violations  of  federally\r\n\nprotected rights, that his approach is inadequate.\"  Id. \r                                                                    \r\n\n          The Supreme  Court has  left  open the  possibility\r\n\nthat a  failure-to-train claim can succeed  without showing a\r\n\npattern of  constitutional violations.  \"[I]n  a narrow range\r\n\nof  circumstances, a  violation of  federal  rights may  be a\r\n\nhighly  predictable consequence  of  a failure  to equip  law\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nenforcement officers with specific tools  to handle recurring\r\n\nsituations.\"  Id. at 1391.  \r                             \r\n\n          This is  not that  case.   Officer Hayes  and Chief\r\n\nPurnell agreed  that every  officer was supplied  with policy\r\n\nguidelines,  including periodic updates.   Lieutenant Nolan's\r\n\nmemo  requiring strip  searches to  be justified  by probable\r\n\ncause  was such an update.   The police  officers also agreed\r\n\nthat the MPI, colloquially known as the  \"police manual,\" was\r\n\nto  be followed by, and  was available to,  the North Reading\r\n\nforce.  Apparently,  not all  the officers  had a  consistent\r\n\nunderstanding of those materials.   However, it is undisputed\r\n\nthat North  Reading did have  an appropriate policy  that was\r\n\ndistributed to  the force; absent prior claims,  it cannot be\r\n\nreasonably inferred  that Chief Purnell knew,  or should have\r\n\nknown,  that his  officers  were not  executing that  policy.\r\n\nAccordingly,  Swain  cannot  make  the  requisite showing  of\r\n\n\"deliberate indifference\"  to her constitutional  rights.  We\r\n\naffirm the grant of summary judgment as to the Town of  North\r\n\nReading.\r\n\nE. State Law Claim\r                              \r\n\n          The  Massachusetts  Declaration of  Rights, article\r\n\n14,   gives  every   person  the  right   to  be   free  from\r\n\n\"unreasonable searches.\"  The Massachusetts Civil Rights Act,\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 12,    11H, 11I, provides a private right\r\n\nof action for persons who are deprived of rights protected by\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\neither federal or  state law.   The district court  concluded\r\n\nthat  the  protections  of  article  14  tracked  the  Fourth\r\n\nAmendment protections  of the federal  Constitution, and that\r\n\nthe  search of  Swain was reasonable  under both  federal and\r\n\nstate  law.  We agree  that cases like  Rodriques v. Furtado,\r                                                                        \r\n\n575  N.E.2d  1124  (Mass.  1991),  indicate  that  the  state\r\n\nconstitution  provides  at  least  the  level  of  protection\r\n\nagainst  strip and visual  body cavity  searches as  does the\r\n\nfederal  Constitution.    However,  in  some  instances,  the\r\n\nSupreme  Judicial  Court  has  concluded  that  \"art[icle] 14\r\n\nprovides  more substantive protection  to criminal defendants\r\n\nthan does the Fourth Amendment.\"   Commonwealth v. Upton, 476\r                                                                    \r\n\nN.E.2d 548,  556-57 (Mass. 1985) (rejecting  federal standard\r\n\nfor   determining  probable   cause  based   on  confidential\r\n\ninformant tips);  see also Commonwealth v.  Blood, 507 N.E.2d\r                                                             \r\n\n1029  (1987).  The Supreme Judicial Court has also noted that\r\n\nthe Massachusetts  law on body cavity  searches under article\r\n\n14 remains uncharted territory.  Rodriques, 575 N.E.2d at 884\r                                                      \r\n\nn.8.  The SJC  did remark, however, that the federal cases on\r\n\nsearches in  prisons  were not  \"germane\"  to a  body  cavity\r\n\nsearch of a suspect for evidence \"because of the 'diminished'\r\n\nFourth  Amendment  rights of  prisoners and  their visitors.\"\r\n\nId. (citations omitted).   This remark certainly suggests the\r               \r\n\npossibility  that  Massachusetts   law  might  place  greater\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\nlimitations  on  the  use of  strip  and  visual body  cavity\r\n\nsearches of arrestees than the federal Constitution does.  \r\n\n          We need  not attempt  to predict fully  what course\r\n\nMassachusetts  law will take.  The Massachusetts Constitution\r\n\ncertainly does not provide  less protection than federal law.\r                                            \r\n\nHaving  found  that  the  search  of  Swain  may   have  been\r\n\nobjectively unreasonable under  the federal Constitution,  we\r\n\nconclude that the law of the Commonwealth would at least view\r\n\nthe search  similarly, and  we therefore reinstate  her state\r\n\nlaw claim against the individual defendants.\r\n\n          Defendants contend that Swain cannot prove that her\r\n\ninjuries  were  perpetrated  by  \"threats,  intimidation,  or\r\n\ncoercion\" as  required under  Massachusetts law.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nPlanned  Parenthood  League v.  Blake,  631  N.E.2d 985,  990\r                                                 \r\n\n(Mass. 1994).  The Supreme Judicial Court has accepted that a\r\n\n\"threat\" may be defined  as an \"exertion of pressure  to make\r\n\nanother  fearful or  apprehensive  of injury  or harm\";  that\r\n\n\"intimidation\" may  be defined as \"putting [a person] in fear\r\n\nfor the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct\"; and that\r\n\n\"coercion\" may be  defined as the application of  physical or\r\n\nmoral  force so as to force someone to do something she would\r\n\notherwise  not have  done.  Id.   On  the facts  here, a jury\r                                           \r\n\ncould  find  that Officer  Hayes  used  the strip  search  to\r\n\nhumiliate or punish Swain and as a means of exerting moral or\r\n\npsychological  pressure  designed  to  weaken  her  perceived\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nresistance to her questioning.

This search occurred after Swain had been in the cell for twenty minutes, and more than an hour after she was arrested.  She was arrested with her boyfriend as a result of his shoplifting;  she was suspected of having possessed a small baggie of marijuana.  The search was ordered, she says, by a police officer immediately after he had interrogated her, while knowing she was represented by counsel.  He had become angry with Swain for saying she knew nothing about her boyfriend's shoplifting.  Swain's boyfriend, who was also in custody, whose shoplifting had triggered the arrests, and who had an extensive criminal record, including drug crimes, was not strip-searched.  The charges against Swain were eventually nol prossed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; 11H, 11I, alleging that the search humiliated her and caused lasting emotional damage.  The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.  The court held that there were no material facts in dispute which would support Swain's claims that the search was not reasonable under the Fourth Amendment and that the officers were not entitled to immunity.  We hold that, as alleged by Swain, a jury could find that the search was not justified by a reasonable suspicion, and that the jury should have the opportunity to resolve the factual disputes pertinent to the issue of whether the officers were entitled to the protections of qualified immunity.  Swain fails, however, to meet the exacting standards for municipal liability under &#167; 1983, even on her version of the facts.  Accordingly, the judgment of the district court with respect to the individual defendants is reversed, but the grant of summary judgment as to the Town of North Reading is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the facts in the light most favorable to Swain, the party opposing summary judgment.  On May 18, 1993, Kelli Swain and her boyfriend, Christopher Milbury, went apartment hunting in the Danvers, Massachusetts area.  Around 10:00 a.m., after the couple had been driving for a little while, Milbury told Swain that he needed to pick up some things at Moynihan Lumber.  Swain waited in the car while Milbury went into the store;  he was gone about ten minutes.  When Milbury got back, he placed a bag behind the seat and started to leave the parking lot.  As they drove out of the parking lot, Swain saw Moynihan Lumber employees pointing at the car;  she also saw a police cruiser pulling into the lot just as she and Milbury were pulling out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain became very upset.  She began questioning Milbury about what was going on.  Then, after they had driven 200 or 300 yards, the police cruiser, which had been following the couple since the parking lot, turned on its blue lights and its siren;  Milbury pulled their car over.  Officer Robert Marchionda then approached the vehicle and Milbury got out of the car.  Swain remained in the car for a minute or two, and then got out when she saw Milbury being handcuffed.  As Swain got out, she dropped a baggie of marijuana on the ground about three feet away from the car.  Officer Marchionda had seen Swain put her hands behind her back and drop an object onto the grass, but could not, at that point, identify the object.  Officer Marchionda radioed for backup, and another officer, Officer Romeo, arrived soon thereafter.  Swain then approached the officers, but was stopped by one of them, who restrained her with his hands.  She asked what was going on, and was told that Milbury was suspected of taking things from Moynihan Lumber.  Officer Marchionda then arrested Swain and handcuffed her.  While he was handcuffing her, he saw that the dropped object was a baggie of marijuana.  He retrieved it.  Swain was pat frisked at the scene, but nothing was found on her person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the police searched the car, they found $400 worth of hardware in the trunk, which had been taken from another store in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and another $400 worth of sawblades, wrapped in a hardware flyer, under the front seat.  Swain was surprised to see the merchandise there.  The police implied that she was an accomplice to Milbury's theft;  she kept saying that she did not know anything about it.  Milbury also told the police that Swain was innocent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of the officers ever asked her about the marijuana on the ground.  Swain did not see anyone pick up the marijuana and did not know if anyone had seen her drop it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After about thirty minutes at the scene, Swain and Milbury were transported in a police cruiser to the North Reading Police Station.  When she got to the station, her handcuffs were removed.  Swain was seated at a booking desk, and an officer had her sign a rights card.  Matron Laura Spinney, the chief of police's secretary, was called to the booking desk because a female was under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While in the booking area, Swain asked to go to the bathroom.  Matron Spinney escorted her to a bathroom, but did not come in with her.  Swain was allowed to close the door almost all of the way, leaving it open just a little.  Spinney stood outside the door to the room, where she could hear Swain using the facilities, but could not see Swain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain then returned to the booking area, and was told that she could make a phone call.  She was shown to a small office, and a police officer stood outside.  She called her attorney and spoke with him for five to ten minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Swain was seated in the booking area, her pocketbook was searched by Spinney.  Spinney found cigarette rolling papers in the pocketbook.  No one discussed these papers with Swain.  At that point, one of the officers advised Swain that marijuana had been found at the scene and that she was going to be charged in connection with it.  Swain denied that it was her marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain was then fingerprinted and photographed.  Officer Ed Hayes, the prosecuting officer and detective department supervisor, ordered Matron Spinney to take Swain to a cell.  Spinney pat frisked Swain before taking her to the cell and found nothing on her.  Swain was left alone in the cell for about twenty minutes.  According to Swain, Sergeant Hayes then came to her cell and attempted to question her about Milbury's criminal activities.  Hayes yelled at Swain, telling her that she was lying, and that she should tell him what was going on.  Swain, who was crying hysterically, kept repeating that she honestly knew nothing.  According to Swain, Hayes' questioning lasted approximately fifteen minutes and then he \"walked out in a huff.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hayes states that he only stayed with Swain in the cell area for approximately one minute.  He has no recollection of what he discussed with Swain, but asserts that it would be normal procedure for him to talk to detainees to advise them about their arraignments.  He does not recall interrogating Swain about Milbury's activities, but cannot state that he did not do so.  Milbury, who was located in another cell where he could hear but not see Swain, stated that he heard Hayes talking to her and also heard Swain crying and saying that she was innocent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About five to ten minutes after Hayes' departure, Spinney returned and apologetically informed Swain that Hayes had ordered her to strip search Swain.  It is Hayes' testimony that he believes he would have ordered such a search prior to speaking with Swain.  Spinney does not know whether the search was ordered before or after Hayes spoke with Swain, but knows that Hayes did not order a strip search when he originally told Spinney to take Swain to the cell.  Spinney states, however, that the order to strip search came almost immediately after she brought Swain to the cell, and not a significant amount of time later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain could not understand why she was being searched and began crying again.  Spinney then ordered Swain to remove all of her clothing except for her bra.  Spinney shook out each item as Swain took it off.  Spinney then made Swain bend over and spread her buttocks.  Swain was very upset and shaking uncontrollably the entire time.  Swain was then told she could get dressed.  Spinney found nothing during her search.  The entire procedure lasted fifteen minutes.  Hayes had not told Spinney what to look for, but Spinney knew that marijuana had been found at the scene, and assumed that she was looking for drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain asserts that, before she was asked to strip, Spinney assured Swain that the video camera in the cell area was already off.  Swain did not see her turn the camera off.  Chief of Police Henry Purnell testified, however, that the station cameras, including the one in the female cell, are constantly left on.  Videotapes are sometimes made from these cameras, but the Department has no policies or procedures concerning the making, storage, or retention of these tapes.  Matrons are instructed to turn the cell camera off, by pressing a button, when conducting a search.  Spinney states that she turned the camera off with a wall switch before searching Swain, but does not recall telling Swain that the camera was off or making any comments about the camera at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Milbury, who had an extensive criminal record, was never strip searched.  Hayes was aware of Milbury's history of drug convictions and knew that Milbury was on probation, having pulled the records while booking Milbury.  Swain had no prior criminal convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Hayes, for his part, tells a different story.  He asserts that he ordered the strip search of Swain immediately upon his arrival at the booking desk, which occurred as soon as he was informed that the arrests had been made, and, he believes, before he spoke with her.  According to Hayes, he ordered the search because the arresting officer showed him the marijuana and informed him that Swain was a principal suspect in a narcotics incident.  He also asserts that he suspected Swain of carrying a concealed weapon, although he acknowledges that this was a generalized suspicion of narcotics suspects, rather than a suspicion based on any characteristics of Swain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Milbury and Swain were arraigned in Woburn District Court and released on their own recognizance.  All charges against Swain were eventually \"nol prossed\" or continued without a finding.  Swain suffered continuing emotional trauma as a result of the search and sought counseling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Town of North Reading's policy on strip searches is outlined in a memo on \"Inventory Search Policy,\" prepared in 1989 by training officer Lieutenant Edward Nolan.  The Policy states that:  \"A strip search of the arrestee is warranted only if the police have probable cause to believe that the arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons on his body.\"   Chief Purnell testified that, in any arrest involving drugs, all arrestees are strip searched.  The shift commander--normally the highest-ranking officer on duty--makes the determination of when a strip search is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipal Police Institute (MPI), a statewide police association, publishes a book called \"Police Manual:  Policies &amp; Procedures.\"   Chief Purnell testified that the North Reading police adhere to the MPI policies.  The relevant MPI policy is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>A strip search of an arrestee is warranted only if officers have reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons on his body.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. All body strip-searches must be approved by the officer-in-charge, who shall consider the following question:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>Is the crime one that is normally associated with weapons or contraband?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Only if the answer to this question is yes and there is a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee has weapons or contraband on his person will a body strip-search be authorized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Body cavity searches should not be conducted without the express approval of the officer-in-charge, and require a search warrant signed by a judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, both Sergeant Hayes and Matron Spinney testified that they were unaware that North Reading had any policy with regard to strip searches.  Hayes testified that it was his policy to strip search individuals whenever narcotics were involved in the case.  Nonetheless, he did not order a strip search of Milbury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain claims, under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; 11H, 11I, that Laura Spinney, Edward Hayes, and the Town of North Reading violated her rights under the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions by subjecting her to an unreasonable search.  On defendants' motion for summary judgment, the district court held that, under United States v. Klein, 522 F.2d 296 (1st Cir.1975), the search of Swain was within the bounds of the Fourth Amendment.  It thought Klein unaffected by Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).  The district court further held that the individual defendants were, in any event, entitled to qualified immunity from suit.  As to the Massachusetts law claims, the court found that, in this area, Massachusetts constitutional law tracked the federal standards.  Finally, the district court found that Swain had failed to meet the exacting standards for municipal liability under &#167; 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain argues on appeal that the police must have probable cause to believe that an arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband in order to strip search that arrestee.  She further argues that, even if the search needed only to be supported by a reasonable suspicion, no such suspicion was present and that the officers are thus not entitled to the protections of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.  EEOC v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 141 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A strip and visual body cavity search of an arrestee must be justified, at the least, by a reasonable suspicion.  Because a jury could find that Officer Hayes acted without a reasonable suspicion that Swain was concealing drugs or weapons, we find that Swain has stated a claim against the individual defendants sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment.  Furthermore, while some courts have suggested that a higher standard may be necessary to justify a strip search and visual body cavity inspection, it was clearly established at the time of the search that the Fourth Amendment requires at least a reasonable suspicion to conduct these types of searches.  Significant factual disputes remain, rendering it impossible to resolve conclusively the immunity question on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>A.

Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 477, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973).  Thus, under Robinson, if the arrest was lawful, a searching officer does not need to have any further justification for performing a full body search of an arrestee.  See United States v. Bizier, 111 F.3d 214, 217 (1st Cir.1997).  Moreover, a search incident to arrest need not occur at the scene of the arrest, but \"may legally be conducted later when the accused arrives at the place of detention.\"  United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 803, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 1237, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Robinson did not hold that all possible searches of an arrestee's body are automatically permissible as a search incident to arrest.  To the contrary, any such search must still be reasonable:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>Holding the Warrant Clause inapplicable to the circumstances present here does not leave law enforcement officials subject to no restraints.  This type of police conduct \"must [still] be tested by the Fourth Amendment's general proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards, 415 U.S. at 808 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. at 1239 n. 9 (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1879, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)).  In Robinson itself, the Court noted that the search at issue, while thorough, did not have \"extreme or patently abusive characteristics.\"  414 U.S. at 236, 94 S.Ct. at 477 (citing Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952)).  Later, in Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 77 L.Ed.2d 65 (1983), the Court explicitly stated that \"[w]e were not addressing in Edwards, and do not discuss here, the circumstances in which a strip search of an arrestee may or may not be appropriate.\"  Id. at 646 n. 2, 103 S.Ct. at 2609 n. 2. \"Robinson simply did not authorize\" a strip and visual body cavity search.  Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1446 (9th Cir.1991);  see also Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1271 (7th Cir.1983)(\"[T]he Robinson court simply did not contemplate the significantly greater intrusions that occur[ ]\" in a visual body cavity inspection.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A strip and visual body cavity search thus requires independent analysis under the Fourth Amendment.  In Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court noted that \"[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.\"  Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.   Rather, the evaluation of the constitutionality of a warrantless search</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. In Wolfish, the Supreme Court applied this balancing test to a prison policy that required arraigned pre-trial detainees to \"expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from outside the institution.\"  Id. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.   Noting that \"this practice instinctively gives [the Court] the most pause,\" id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884, the Court found only that visual body cavity searches can \"be conducted on less than probable cause.\"  Id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885.   In so holding, Wolfish \"did not, however, read out of the Constitution the provision of general application that a search be justified as reasonable under the circumstances.\"  Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 800 (2d Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying the Wolfish balancing test to searches of the type to which Swain was subjected, courts have recognized that strip and visual body cavity searches impinge seriously upon the values that the Fourth Amendment was meant to protect.  These searches require an arrestee not only to strip naked in front of a stranger, but also to expose the most private areas of her body to others.  This is often, as here, done while the person arrested is required to assume degrading and humiliating positions.  Our circuit has \"recognize[d], as have all courts that have considered the issue, the severe if not gross interference with a person's privacy that occurs when guards conduct a visual inspection of body cavities.\"  Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886, 887 (1st Cir.1983).  The Seventh Circuit has described \"strip searches involving the visual inspection of the anal and genital areas as demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission.\"  Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272 (internal quotation marks omitted);  see also Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[A] strip search can hardly be characterized as a routine procedure or as a minimally invasive means of maintaining prison security.  Indeed, a strip search, by its very nature, constitutes an extreme intrusion upon personal privacy, as well as an offense to the dignity of the individual.\");  Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 702, 711 (9th Cir.1990)(\"Strip searches involving the visual exploration of body cavities are dehumanizing and humiliating.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other side of the scales, courts must weigh the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  Institutional security has been found to be a compelling reason for conducting warrantless strip and visual body cavity searches.  See, e.g., Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884 (prisoner strip searches after contact visits justified because detention facility \"is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers\").  Some courts have held that a warrantless strip search may also be justified by the need to discover and preserve concealed evidence of a crime.  See, e.g., Justice v. Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11th Cir.1992).  But see Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1446 (strip and visual body cavity search with less than probable cause only permitted to protect institutional safety and security;  search for evidence must be justified by probable cause).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Balancing these interests, courts have concluded that, to be reasonable under Wolfish, strip and visual body cavity searches must be justified by at least a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See, e.g, Justice, 961 F.2d at 192;  Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989);  Weber, 804 F.2d at 802;  Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1985);  Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 615 (9th Cir.1984);  Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273.   This court has held that the reasonable suspicion standard is the appropriate one for justifying strip searches in other contexts.  See Wood, 89 F.3d at 929 (prison visitors);  United States v. Uricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d 162, 166 (1st Cir.1991)(non-routine border searches);  cf.  Burns v. Loranger, 907 F.2d 233, 236-38 (1st Cir.1990) (officers protected by qualified immunity for warrantless strip search of arrestee where there were exigent circumstances and probable cause to believe controlled substance would be found on arrestee's person).  Accordingly, it is clear that at least the reasonable suspicion standard governs strip and visual body cavity searches in the arrestee context as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants, and the court below, rely upon United States v. Klein, 522 F.2d 296 (1st Cir.1975).  In that case, the defendant, who was arrested after a sale of cocaine, was subjected to a strip search, including a visual inspection of his rectum.  Id. at 299.   This court approved that search as \"[a] post-arrest search of the person, plainly approved by Edwards,\" and found that a lack of individualized suspicion that the suspect was harboring evidence did not render the search unreasonable.  Id. at 300 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Klein was decided before significant Supreme Court precedent in the area, and we are bound by the Supreme Court's developing doctrine.  Klein predates Lafayette, decided in 1983, where the Supreme Court stated that Edwards did not answer the question of when a strip search was appropriate.  Lafayette, 462 U.S. at 646 n. 2, 103 S.Ct. at 2609 n. 2. Klein also predated Wolfish, with its explicit recognition of the invasiveness of strip and visual body cavity searches.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.   Subsequent to Klein, and sensitive to the developing doctrine, this circuit has repeatedly recognized that strip and/or visual body cavity searches are not routine, and must be carefully evaluated.  See Burns, 907 F.2d at 236-37;  Bonitz v. Fair, 804 F.2d 164, 170-72 (1st Cir.1986);  Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 564 (1st Cir.1985);  Arruda, 710 F.2d at 887.   Accordingly, to the extent that Klein held that strip and visual body cavity searches are simply searches incident to arrest, and do not need to be further tested for reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, it does not survive Lafayette, Wolfish, and this court's subsequent strip search decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Search of Swain</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the particular search at issue, we conclude, taking all the facts in the light most favorable to Swain, that a jury could find that the search was unreasonable and thus violated the Fourth Amendment.  Accordingly, we find that Swain has stated a trialworthy claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  On these facts, there appears to be the distinct possibility that Officer Hayes ordered the strip search in retaliation for his failed interrogation of Swain in her cell, imposing sexual humiliation on her as a punishment for what he perceived as her non-cooperation.  Hayes' angry response to Swain's inability to provide information about Milbury's activities and the timing of the search raise this inference.  This possibility distinguishes this case from Klein, where the court found that there was \"no evidence that the stripping was a pretext to humiliate or degrade.\"  Klein, 522 F.2d at 300.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must thus examine whether, on these facts, an objective officer would have had a reasonable suspicion that Swain was concealing drugs or contraband on her person.  Three factors suggest that there were not adequate grounds to justify the strip and visual body cavity search of Swain.  First, there is the timing of the search.  Swain had been alone in the cell for some period of time before she was searched and no one thought it important to search her before she angered Hayes by not giving him the information he sought.  Perhaps more importantly, she had been allowed to go to the bathroom by herself, unobserved, prior to being taken to her cell.  This also indicates that no one thought she had secreted drugs in her private parts.  Cf. Burns, 907 F.2d at 238 (common knowledge that drug users and dealers with controlled substances on their persons often attempt to flush drugs down the toilet).  If a warrantless strip search may be justified by the need to avoid the destruction of concealed evidence, Swain already had had ample opportunity to destroy any such evidence.  To the extent there was any reason to believe such evidence still existed, further delay to obtain a warrant would not have significantly increased the risk of destruction.  This was particularly true because Swain was kept under observation and recorded by video camera while in the holding cell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as noted, the most compelling justification for warrantless strip and visual body cavity searches is institutional security.  It is uncontroverted that, prior to her arraignment, Swain was the only person in the women's holding cell of the North Reading Police Station.  Her arraignment was later the same afternoon, and she was then released, on her own recognizance.  There was no risk that she would come into contact with other prisoners, or be able to smuggle contraband or weapons into a secure environment.  Hayes stated that he believed that Swain, as a narcotics suspect, might have been carrying a concealed weapon but he did not assert that Swain posed a threat to his safety or that of others in the police station.  The institutional security justification thus appears to be absent from this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, there is the differential treatment by the police of the young woman and her boyfriend.  Swain and Milbury were first pulled over because of Milbury's shoplifting activities.  Officer Hayes stated that, prior to searching Swain, he had examined both Swain's and Milbury's records.  Officer Hayes knew that Milbury was on probation and had a history of drug convictions.  By contrast, Swain did not have a criminal record.  Milbury had told officers, including Hayes, that the marijuana was his.  Yet Milbury was not strip searched.  If there was an objective basis--apart from retaliation--for stripping Swain, it would have been objectively reasonable, and more so, to search Milbury as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, Swain did drop a baggie of marijuana at the scene of the crime.  Officer Hayes expressed the view (belied by his failure to strip search Milbury) that a strip search was justified whenever narcotics are involved in the case.  This is not consistent with either the Town policy, which requires probable cause, or the MPI policy, which requires an individualized suspicion, even where the crime involves contraband or weapons.  The record does not reveal how much marijuana was in the baggie Swain dropped, nor does it reveal whether possession of that amount constitutes a misdemeanor or a felony under Massachusetts law.  Nothing in the record suggests that Swain was suspected of being a distributor of marijuana.  The fact that Swain may have possessed some unspecified amount of marijuana is not enough to overcome, as a matter of law, the factors, discussed above, under which a jury could find the search of Swain unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that a jury could lawfully find that there was no objectively reasonable basis for strip searching Swain and that, on these facts, Swain has stated a claim for violation of her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches that survives defendants' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Qualified Immunity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants assert that they are, in any event, entitled to qualified immunity from suit.  There are two prongs to the qualified immunity analysis.  First, was the constitutional right in question clearly established at the time of the alleged violation?  St. Hilaire v. Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1995).  That is a question of law for the court.  Elder v. Holloway, 510 U.S. 510, 516, 114 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 344 (1994).  Second, would a reasonable, similarly situated official understand that the challenged conduct violated that established right?  St. Hilaire, 71 F.3d at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable strip searches has long been clearly established in this circuit, as elsewhere.  See Burns, 907 F.2d at 236;  Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 569 (\"It can hardly be debated that ... in 1977, [there was] a 'clearly established' Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches.\").  As discussed above, Klein 's holding that such a search is a reasonable search incident to arrest had been abrogated by subsequent Supreme Court and First Circuit cases, and had been squarely rejected by the other circuit courts to consider the issue.  See Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1446, 1449 n. 11 (holding that strip search with visual body cavity inspection was not justifiable as a search incident to arrest but was governed by higher standard, and rejecting Klein );  Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1271 n. 7 (searches like the one in Klein are only constitutional where there is a reasonable belief that arrestee is concealing contraband;  routine post-arrest strip search of misdemeanants is unconstitutional);  see also Weber, 804 F.2d at 801 nn. 6 &amp; 7, 803 (holding that it was, in 1986, \"clearly established\" that policy of routine strip and visual body cavity searches of arrestees was unconstitutional, and citing \"ten opinions from seven circuits\" that refused to condone such searches).  Defendants themselves agree that the search must be evaluated under the reasonableness standard articulated by the 1979 Supreme Court decision in Wolfish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is thus whether an objectively reasonable officer would understand that a strip search of Swain was, under these circumstances, unreasonable.  This prong of the inquiry, while requiring a legal determination, is highly fact specific, and may not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment when material facts are substantially in dispute.  2 Nahmod, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Litigation:  The Law of Section 1983 &#167; 8.08, at 136-39 (3d ed.1991).The ultimate question of whether a reasonable police officer, on the basis of information known to him, could have believed his actions were in accord with constitutional rights is a question of law, subject to resolution by the judge not the jury.  But if there is a factual dispute, that factual dispute must be resolved by a fact finder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">St. Hilaire, 71 F.3d at 24 n. 1 (internal citations omitted);  Figueroa-Rodriguez v. Aquino, 863 F.2d 1037, 1041 (1st Cir.1988)(\"While the qualified immunity inquiry is ultimately a question of law, it may also necessitate determining certain of the essential facts.\")  (citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987));  see also Consolo v. George, 58 F.3d 791, 794 (1st Cir.)  (where law is clearly established, and there is ample evidence that officers acted unreasonably, proper to submit issue of objective reasonableness to the jury on special interrogatories), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 520, 133 L.Ed.2d 428 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the immunity question should be resolved, where possible, in advance of trial.  See, e.g., Veilleux v. Perschau, 101 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1996).  However, disposition of the question on summary judgment is not always possible.  Here, some material facts are significantly in dispute.  Swain's story and that of Officer Hayes conflict on the timing of the relevant events.  Some proffers are supported or contradicted by other witnesses, including Spinney and Milbury.  Hayes contends that, as the officer in charge of the investigation, he ordered the search immediately upon being informed that a narcotics violation had occurred.  The timing of when the search was ordered is essential to a determination of whether defendants' conduct was objectively reasonable.  There are thus factual issues, potentially turning on credibility, that must be resolved by the trier of fact.  Only after the resolution of these conflicts may the trial court apply the relevant law on objective reasonableness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also recognize that police officers are protected in close cases by the doctrine of qualified immunity, and that immunity serves to protect law enforcement from the chilling threat of liability.  Vargas-Badillo v. Diaz-Torres, 114 F.3d 3, (1st Cir.1997);  Joyce v. Town of Tewksbury, 112 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.1997) (patent violation of law necessary to strip police officers of qualified immunity).  On the other hand, qualified immunity does not protect \"those who knowingly violate the law.\"  Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1096, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986).  Here, further resolution of the facts is necessary to determine whether or not this case falls into the category of \"close cases\" in which the police are accorded \"a fairly wide zone of protection.\"  Roy v. Inhabitants of the City of Lewiston, 42 F.3d 691, 695 (1st Cir.1994).  On the facts as related by Swain, Officer Hayes used a warrantless strip search and visual body cavity inspection as a tool to humiliate and degrade her in retaliation for her refusal to respond to interrogation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Independently of the issue of allegations that Officer Hayes deliberately violated the law in order to retaliate, as forbidden by Malley, Swain also asserts the search is not, on its facts, objectively reasonable.  This search, on Swain's allegations, occurred after she had ample opportunity to dispose of any hidden evidence and when she was alone in a monitored cell, posing no danger to others that might justify hastily proceeding without a warrant.  Such allegations, if true, do not represent a \"close case\" but a flagrant violation of the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable searches.  Whether those allegations are true or not must be resolved by the finder of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Municipal Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain claims that the Town of North Reading is liable for the injuries that she suffered.  The Supreme Court has recently clarified the necessary showing for a claim of municipal liability under &#167; 1983:[I]n Monell and subsequent cases we have required a plaintiff seeking to impose liability on a municipality under &#167; 1983 to identify a municipal \"policy\" or \"custom\" that caused the plaintiff's injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As our &#167; 1983 municipal liability jurisprudence illustrates, however, it is not enough for a &#167; 1983 plaintiff merely to identify conduct properly attributable to the municipality.  The plaintiff must also demonstrate that, through its deliberate conduct, the municipality was the \"moving force\" behind the injury alleged.  That is, a plaintiff must show that the municipal action was taken with the requisite degree of culpability and must demonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Board of the County Comm'rs v. Brown, --- U.S. ----, ----, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 1388, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997) (discussing Monell v. New York City Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), and progeny).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Swain predicates municipal liability on a failure to properly communicate to the police force a uniform policy on when strip searches are appropriate and who may authorize them.  This failure to train, Swain alleges, rose to the level of conscious indifference to the constitutional rights of arrestees.  Swain accurately notes that the various police personnel, including the police chief, expressed some confusion as to when strip searches are warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court addressed failure to train claims in Brown:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>We concluded in Canton that an \"inadequate training\" claim could be the basis for &#167; 1983 liability in \"limited circumstances.\"   We spoke, however, of a deficient training \"program,\" necessarily intended to apply over time to multiple employees.  Existence of a \"program\" makes proof of fault at least possible in an inadequate training case.  If a program does not prevent constitutional violations, municipal decisionmakers may eventually be put on notice that a new program is called for.  Their continued adherence to an approach that they know or should know has failed to prevent tortious conduct by employees may establish the conscious disregard for the consequences of their action--the \"deliberate indifference\"--necessary to trigger municipal liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 117 S.Ct. at 1390 (discussing and citing Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain does not, however, point to any other incidents in which the North Reading police force violated the rights of arrestees through strip and visual body cavity searches.  There was thus \"no notice to the municipal decisionmaker, based on previous violations of federally protected rights, that his approach is inadequate.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has left open the possibility that a failure-to-train claim can succeed without showing a pattern of constitutional violations.  \"[I]n a narrow range of circumstances, a violation of federal rights may be a highly predictable consequence of a failure to equip law enforcement officers with specific tools to handle recurring situations.\"  Id. at 1391.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not that case.  Officer Hayes and Chief Purnell agreed that every officer was supplied with policy guidelines, including periodic updates.  Lieutenant Nolan's memo requiring strip searches to be justified by probable cause was such an update.  The police officers also agreed that the MPI, colloquially known as the \"police manual,\" was to be followed by, and was available to, the North Reading force.  Apparently, not all the officers had a consistent understanding of those materials.  However, it is undisputed that North Reading did have an appropriate policy that was distributed to the force;  absent prior claims, it cannot be reasonably inferred that Chief Purnell knew, or should have known, that his officers were not executing that policy.  Accordingly, Swain cannot make the requisite showing of \"deliberate indifference\" to her constitutional rights.  We affirm the grant of summary judgment as to the Town of North Reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. State Law Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, article 14, gives every person the right to be free from \"unreasonable searches.\"   The Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; 11H, 11I, provides a private right of action for persons who are deprived of rights protected by either federal or state law.  The district court concluded that the protections of article 14 tracked the Fourth Amendment protections of the federal Constitution, and that the search of Swain was reasonable under both federal and state law.  We agree that cases like Rodriques v. Furtado, 410 Mass. 878, 575 N.E.2d 1124 (1991), indicate that the state constitution provides at least the level of protection against strip and visual body cavity searches as does the federal Constitution.  However, in some instances, the Supreme Judicial Court has concluded that \"art[icle] 14 provides more substantive protection to criminal defendants than does the Fourth Amendment.\"  Commonwealth v. Upton, 394 Mass. 363, 476 N.E.2d 548, 556-57 (1985) (rejecting federal standard for determining probable cause based on confidential informant tips);  see also Commonwealth v. Blood, 400 Mass. 61, 507 N.E.2d 1029 (1987).  The Supreme Judicial Court has also noted that the Massachusetts law on body cavity searches under article 14 remains uncharted territory.  Rodriques, 410 Mass. at 884 n. 8, 575 N.E.2d 1124.  The SJC did remark, however, that the federal cases on searches in prisons were not \"germane\" to a body cavity search of a suspect for evidence \"because of the 'diminished' Fourth Amendment rights of prisoners and their visitors.\"  Id. (citations omitted).  This remark certainly suggests the possibility that Massachusetts law might place greater limitations on the use of strip and visual body cavity searches of arrestees than the federal Constitution does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not attempt to predict fully what course Massachusetts law will take.  The Massachusetts Constitution certainly does not provide less protection than federal law.  Having found that the search of Swain may have been objectively unreasonable under the federal Constitution, we conclude that the law of the Commonwealth would at least view the search similarly, and we therefore reinstate her state law claim against the individual defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that Swain cannot prove that her injuries were perpetrated by \"threats, intimidation, or coercion\" as required under Massachusetts law.  See, e.g., Planned Parenthood League v. Blake, 417 Mass. 467, 631 N.E.2d 985, 990 (1994).  The Supreme Judicial Court has accepted that a \"threat\" may be defined as an \"exertion of pressure to make another fearful or apprehensive of injury or harm\";  that \"intimidation\" may be defined as \"putting [a person] in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct\";  and that \"coercion\" may be defined as the application of physical or moral force so as to force someone to do something she would otherwise not have done.  Id. On the facts here, a jury could find that Officer Hayes used the strip search to humiliate or punish Swain and as a means of exerting moral or psychological pressure designed to weaken her perceived resistance to her questioning.  This could indeed constitute \"intimidation\" or \"coercion\" within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed with respect to the Town of North Reading, and reversed with respect to the individual defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As noted above, the Ninth Circuit has held that, absent a threat to institutional security, the higher showing of probable cause is required to justify such a search.

United States, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), a police officer's subjective motivations do not serve to invalidate a search for exclusionary rule purposes, so long as the search was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.  Whren, however, also stressed that \"the Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race,\" id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774, and, we would assume, gender.  The exclusionary rule, as the Supreme Court recognized in Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 344, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1097-98, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986), balances different interests than those in a &#167; 1983 action.  (\"While we believe the exclusionary rule serves a necessary purpose, it obviously does so at a considerable cost to the society as a whole, because it excludes evidence probative of guilt....  On the other hand, a damages remedy for [a Fourth Amendment violation] imposes a cost directly on the officer responsible ..., without the side effect of hampering a criminal prosecution.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In St. Hilaire, we noted that the proper division of functions between judge and jury on the objective reasonableness inquiry may be accomplished either through special interrogatories or through carefully structured jury instructions.

This search occurred after Swain had been in the cell for twenty minutes, and more than an hour after she was arrested.  She was arrested with her boyfriend as a result of his shoplifting;  she was suspected of having possessed a small baggie of marijuana.  The search was ordered, she says, by a police officer immediately after he had interrogated her, while knowing she was represented by counsel.  He had become angry with Swain for saying she knew nothing about her boyfriend's shoplifting.  Swain's boyfriend, who was also in custody, whose shoplifting had triggered the arrests, and who had an extensive criminal record, including drug crimes, was not strip-searched.  The charges against Swain were eventually nol prossed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; 11H, 11I, alleging that the search humiliated her and caused lasting emotional damage.  The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.  The court held that there were no material facts in dispute which would support Swain's claims that the search was not reasonable under the Fourth Amendment and that the officers were not entitled to immunity.  We hold that, as alleged by Swain, a jury could find that the search was not justified by a reasonable suspicion, and that the jury should have the opportunity to resolve the factual disputes pertinent to the issue of whether the officers were entitled to the protections of qualified immunity.  Swain fails, however, to meet the exacting standards for municipal liability under &#167; 1983, even on her version of the facts.  Accordingly, the judgment of the district court with respect to the individual defendants is reversed, but the grant of summary judgment as to the Town of North Reading is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the facts in the light most favorable to Swain, the party opposing summary judgment.  On May 18, 1993, Kelli Swain and her boyfriend, Christopher Milbury, went apartment hunting in the Danvers, Massachusetts area.  Around 10:00 a.m., after the couple had been driving for a little while, Milbury told Swain that he needed to pick up some things at Moynihan Lumber.  Swain waited in the car while Milbury went into the store;  he was gone about ten minutes.  When Milbury got back, he placed a bag behind the seat and started to leave the parking lot.  As they drove out of the parking lot, Swain saw Moynihan Lumber employees pointing at the car;  she also saw a police cruiser pulling into the lot just as she and Milbury were pulling out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain became very upset.  She began questioning Milbury about what was going on.  Then, after they had driven 200 or 300 yards, the police cruiser, which had been following the couple since the parking lot, turned on its blue lights and its siren;  Milbury pulled their car over.  Officer Robert Marchionda then approached the vehicle and Milbury got out of the car.  Swain remained in the car for a minute or two, and then got out when she saw Milbury being handcuffed.  As Swain got out, she dropped a baggie of marijuana on the ground about three feet away from the car.  Officer Marchionda had seen Swain put her hands behind her back and drop an object onto the grass, but could not, at that point, identify the object.  Officer Marchionda radioed for backup, and another officer, Officer Romeo, arrived soon thereafter.  Swain then approached the officers, but was stopped by one of them, who restrained her with his hands.  She asked what was going on, and was told that Milbury was suspected of taking things from Moynihan Lumber.  Officer Marchionda then arrested Swain and handcuffed her.  While he was handcuffing her, he saw that the dropped object was a baggie of marijuana.  He retrieved it.  Swain was pat frisked at the scene, but nothing was found on her person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the police searched the car, they found $400 worth of hardware in the trunk, which had been taken from another store in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and another $400 worth of sawblades, wrapped in a hardware flyer, under the front seat.  Swain was surprised to see the merchandise there.  The police implied that she was an accomplice to Milbury's theft;  she kept saying that she did not know anything about it.  Milbury also told the police that Swain was innocent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of the officers ever asked her about the marijuana on the ground.  Swain did not see anyone pick up the marijuana and did not know if anyone had seen her drop it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After about thirty minutes at the scene, Swain and Milbury were transported in a police cruiser to the North Reading Police Station.  When she got to the station, her handcuffs were removed.  Swain was seated at a booking desk, and an officer had her sign a rights card.  Matron Laura Spinney, the chief of police's secretary, was called to the booking desk because a female was under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While in the booking area, Swain asked to go to the bathroom.  Matron Spinney escorted her to a bathroom, but did not come in with her.  Swain was allowed to close the door almost all of the way, leaving it open just a little.  Spinney stood outside the door to the room, where she could hear Swain using the facilities, but could not see Swain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain then returned to the booking area, and was told that she could make a phone call.  She was shown to a small office, and a police officer stood outside.  She called her attorney and spoke with him for five to ten minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Swain was seated in the booking area, her pocketbook was searched by Spinney.  Spinney found cigarette rolling papers in the pocketbook.  No one discussed these papers with Swain.  At that point, one of the officers advised Swain that marijuana had been found at the scene and that she was going to be charged in connection with it.  Swain denied that it was her marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain was then fingerprinted and photographed.  Officer Ed Hayes, the prosecuting officer and detective department supervisor, ordered Matron Spinney to take Swain to a cell.  Spinney pat frisked Swain before taking her to the cell and found nothing on her.  Swain was left alone in the cell for about twenty minutes.  According to Swain, Sergeant Hayes then came to her cell and attempted to question her about Milbury's criminal activities.  Hayes yelled at Swain, telling her that she was lying, and that she should tell him what was going on.  Swain, who was crying hysterically, kept repeating that she honestly knew nothing.  According to Swain, Hayes' questioning lasted approximately fifteen minutes and then he \"walked out in a huff.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hayes states that he only stayed with Swain in the cell area for approximately one minute.  He has no recollection of what he discussed with Swain, but asserts that it would be normal procedure for him to talk to detainees to advise them about their arraignments.  He does not recall interrogating Swain about Milbury's activities, but cannot state that he did not do so.  Milbury, who was located in another cell where he could hear but not see Swain, stated that he heard Hayes talking to her and also heard Swain crying and saying that she was innocent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About five to ten minutes after Hayes' departure, Spinney returned and apologetically informed Swain that Hayes had ordered her to strip search Swain.  It is Hayes' testimony that he believes he would have ordered such a search prior to speaking with Swain.  Spinney does not know whether the search was ordered before or after Hayes spoke with Swain, but knows that Hayes did not order a strip search when he originally told Spinney to take Swain to the cell.  Spinney states, however, that the order to strip search came almost immediately after she brought Swain to the cell, and not a significant amount of time later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain could not understand why she was being searched and began crying again.  Spinney then ordered Swain to remove all of her clothing except for her bra.  Spinney shook out each item as Swain took it off.  Spinney then made Swain bend over and spread her buttocks.  Swain was very upset and shaking uncontrollably the entire time.  Swain was then told she could get dressed.  Spinney found nothing during her search.  The entire procedure lasted fifteen minutes.  Hayes had not told Spinney what to look for, but Spinney knew that marijuana had been found at the scene, and assumed that she was looking for drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain asserts that, before she was asked to strip, Spinney assured Swain that the video camera in the cell area was already off.  Swain did not see her turn the camera off.  Chief of Police Henry Purnell testified, however, that the station cameras, including the one in the female cell, are constantly left on.  Videotapes are sometimes made from these cameras, but the Department has no policies or procedures concerning the making, storage, or retention of these tapes.  Matrons are instructed to turn the cell camera off, by pressing a button, when conducting a search.  Spinney states that she turned the camera off with a wall switch before searching Swain, but does not recall telling Swain that the camera was off or making any comments about the camera at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Milbury, who had an extensive criminal record, was never strip searched.  Hayes was aware of Milbury's history of drug convictions and knew that Milbury was on probation, having pulled the records while booking Milbury.  Swain had no prior criminal convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Hayes, for his part, tells a different story.  He asserts that he ordered the strip search of Swain immediately upon his arrival at the booking desk, which occurred as soon as he was informed that the arrests had been made, and, he believes, before he spoke with her.  According to Hayes, he ordered the search because the arresting officer showed him the marijuana and informed him that Swain was a principal suspect in a narcotics incident.  He also asserts that he suspected Swain of carrying a concealed weapon, although he acknowledges that this was a generalized suspicion of narcotics suspects, rather than a suspicion based on any characteristics of Swain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Milbury and Swain were arraigned in Woburn District Court and released on their own recognizance.  All charges against Swain were eventually \"nol prossed\" or continued without a finding.  Swain suffered continuing emotional trauma as a result of the search and sought counseling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Town of North Reading's policy on strip searches is outlined in a memo on \"Inventory Search Policy,\" prepared in 1989 by training officer Lieutenant Edward Nolan.  The Policy states that:  \"A strip search of the arrestee is warranted only if the police have probable cause to believe that the arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons on his body.\"   Chief Purnell testified that, in any arrest involving drugs, all arrestees are strip searched.  The shift commander--normally the highest-ranking officer on duty--makes the determination of when a strip search is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipal Police Institute (MPI), a statewide police association, publishes a book called \"Police Manual:  Policies &amp; Procedures.\"   Chief Purnell testified that the North Reading police adhere to the MPI policies.  The relevant MPI policy is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>A strip search of an arrestee is warranted only if officers have reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons on his body.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. All body strip-searches must be approved by the officer-in-charge, who shall consider the following question:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>Is the crime one that is normally associated with weapons or contraband?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Only if the answer to this question is yes and there is a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee has weapons or contraband on his person will a body strip-search be authorized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Body cavity searches should not be conducted without the express approval of the officer-in-charge, and require a search warrant signed by a judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, both Sergeant Hayes and Matron Spinney testified that they were unaware that North Reading had any policy with regard to strip searches.  Hayes testified that it was his policy to strip search individuals whenever narcotics were involved in the case.  Nonetheless, he did not order a strip search of Milbury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain claims, under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; 11H, 11I, that Laura Spinney, Edward Hayes, and the Town of North Reading violated her rights under the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions by subjecting her to an unreasonable search.  On defendants' motion for summary judgment, the district court held that, under United States v. Klein, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"329981\"><a href=\"/opinion/329981/united-states-v-lawrence-a-klein/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1975), the search of Swain was within the bounds of the Fourth Amendment.  It thought Klein unaffected by Bell v. Wolfish, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span> (1979).  The district court further held that the individual defendants were, in any event, entitled to qualified immunity from suit.  As to the Massachusetts law claims, the court found that, in this area, Massachusetts constitutional law tracked the federal standards.  Finally, the district court found that Swain had failed to meet the exacting standards for municipal liability under &#167; 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swain argues on appeal that the police must have probable cause to believe that an arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband in order to strip search that arrestee.  She further argues that, even if the search needed only to be supported by a reasonable suspicion, no such suspicion was present and that the officers are thus not entitled to the protections of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.

Because a jury could find that Officer Hayes acted without a reasonable suspicion that Swain was concealing drugs or weapons, we find that Swain has stated a claim against the individual defendants sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment.  Furthermore, while some courts have suggested that a higher standard may be necessary to justify a strip search and visual body cavity inspection, it was clearly established at the time of the search that the Fourth Amendment requires at least a reasonable suspicion to conduct these types of searches.  Significant factual disputes remain, rendering it impossible to resolve conclusively the immunity question on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>A.

These searches require an arrestee not only to strip naked in front of a stranger, but also to expose the most private areas of her body to others.  This is often, as here, done while the person arrested is required to assume degrading and humiliating positions.

In that case, the defendant, who was arrested after a sale of cocaine, was subjected to a strip search, including a visual inspection of his rectum.  Id. at 299.   This court approved that search as \"[a] post-arrest search of the person, plainly approved by Edwards,\" and found that a lack of individualized suspicion that the suspect was harboring evidence did not render the search unreasonable.

Klein predates Lafayette, decided in 1983, where the Supreme Court stated that Edwards did not answer the question of when a strip search was appropriate.  Lafayette, 462 U.S. at 646 n. 2, 103 S.Ct. at 2609 n. 2. Klein also predated Wolfish, with its explicit recognition of the invasiveness of strip and visual body cavity searches.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.   Subsequent to Klein, and sensitive to the developing doctrine, this circuit has repeatedly recognized that strip and/or visual body cavity searches are not routine, and must be carefully evaluated.  See Burns, 907 F.2d at 236-37;  Bonitz v. Fair, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"478732\"><a href=\"/opinion/478732/karen-bonitz-v-michael-v-fair-karen-bonitz-v-michael-v-fair-appeal-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">804</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 170-72 (1st Cir.1986);  Blackburn v.

Accordingly, to the extent that Klein held that strip and visual body cavity searches are simply searches incident to arrest, and do not need to be further tested for reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, it does not survive Lafayette, Wolfish, and this court's subsequent strip search decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Search of Swain</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the particular search at issue, we conclude, taking all the facts in the light most favorable to Swain, that a jury could find that the search was unreasonable and thus violated the Fourth Amendment.  Accordingly, we find that Swain has stated a trialworthy claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  On these facts, there appears to be the distinct possibility that Officer Hayes ordered the strip search in retaliation for his failed interrogation of Swain in her cell, imposing sexual humiliation on her as a punishment for what he perceived as her non-cooperation.  Hayes' angry response to Swain's inability to provide information about Milbury's activities and the timing of the search raise this inference.  This possibility distinguishes this case from Klein, where the court found that there was \"no evidence that the stripping was a pretext to humiliate or degrade.\"  Klein, 522 F.2d at 300.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must thus examine whether, on these facts, an objective officer would have had a reasonable suspicion that Swain was concealing drugs or contraband on her person.  Three factors suggest that there were not adequate grounds to justify the strip and visual body cavity search of Swain.  First, there is the timing of the search.  Swain had been alone in the cell for some period of time before she was searched and no one thought it important to search her before she angered Hayes by not giving him the information he sought.  Perhaps more importantly, she had been allowed to go to the bathroom by herself, unobserved, prior to being taken to her cell.  This also indicates that no one thought she had secreted drugs in her private parts.  Cf. Burns, 907 F.2d at 238 (common knowledge that drug users and dealers with controlled substances on their persons often attempt to flush drugs down the toilet).  If a warrantless strip search may be justified by the need to avoid the destruction of concealed evidence, Swain already had had ample opportunity to destroy any such evidence.  To the extent there was any reason to believe such evidence still existed, further delay to obtain a warrant would not have significantly increased the risk of destruction.  This was particularly true because Swain was kept under observation and recorded by video camera while in the holding cell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as noted, the most compelling justification for warrantless strip and visual body cavity searches is institutional security.  It is uncontroverted that, prior to her arraignment, Swain was the only person in the women's holding cell of the North Reading Police Station.  Her arraignment was later the same afternoon, and she was then released, on her own recognizance.  There was no risk that she would come into contact with other prisoners, or be able to smuggle contraband or weapons into a secure environment.  Hayes stated that he believed that Swain, as a narcotics suspect, might have been carrying a concealed weapon but he did not assert that Swain posed a threat to his safety or that of others in the police station.  The institutional security justification thus appears to be absent from this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, there is the differential treatment by the police of the young woman and her boyfriend.  Swain and Milbury were first pulled over because of Milbury's shoplifting activities.  Officer Hayes stated that, prior to searching Swain, he had examined both Swain's and Milbury's records.  Officer Hayes knew that Milbury was on probation and had a history of drug convictions.  By contrast, Swain did not have a criminal record.  Milbury had told officers, including Hayes, that the marijuana was his.  Yet Milbury was not strip searched.  If there was an objective basis--apart from retaliation--for stripping Swain, it would have been objectively reasonable, and more so, to search Milbury as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, Swain did drop a baggie of marijuana at the scene of the crime.  Officer Hayes expressed the view (belied by his failure to strip search Milbury) that a strip search was justified whenever narcotics are involved in the case.  This is not consistent with either the Town policy, which requires probable cause, or the MPI policy, which requires an individualized suspicion, even where the crime involves contraband or weapons.  The record does not reveal how much marijuana was in the baggie Swain dropped, nor does it reveal whether possession of that amount constitutes a misdemeanor or a felony under Massachusetts law.  Nothing in the record suggests that Swain was suspected of being a distributor of marijuana.  The fact that Swain may have possessed some unspecified amount of marijuana is not enough to overcome, as a matter of law, the factors, discussed above, under which a jury could find the search of Swain unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that a jury could lawfully find that there was no objectively reasonable basis for strip searching Swain and that, on these facts, Swain has stated a claim for violation of her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches that survives defendants' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Qualified Immunity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants assert that they are, in any event, entitled to qualified immunity from suit.  There are two prongs to the qualified immunity analysis.  First, was the constitutional right in question clearly established at the time of the alleged violation?  St. Hilaire v. Laconia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709033\"><a href=\"/opinion/709033/kathy-st-hilaire-etc-v-city-of-laconia/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1995).  That is a question of law for the court.  Elder v. Holloway, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112933\"><a href=\"/opinion/112933/elder-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 516, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112933\"><a href=\"/opinion/112933/elder-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span> (1994).  Second, would a reasonable, similarly situated official understand that the challenged conduct violated that established right?  St. Hilaire, 71 F.3d at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable strip searches has long been clearly established in this circuit, as elsewhere.  See Burns, 907 F.2d at 236;  Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 569 (\"It can hardly be debated that ... in 1977, [there was] a 'clearly established' Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches.\").  As discussed above, Klein 's holding that such a search is a reasonable search incident to arrest had been abrogated by subsequent Supreme Court and First Circuit cases, and had been squarely rejected by the other circuit courts to consider the issue.  See Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1446, 1449 n. 11 (holding that strip search with visual body cavity inspection was not justifiable as a search incident to arrest but was governed by higher standard, and rejecting Klein );  Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1271 n. 7 (searches like the one in Klein are only constitutional where there is a reasonable belief that arrestee is concealing contraband;  routine post-arrest strip search of misdemeanants is unconstitutional);  see also Weber, 804 F.2d at 801 nn. 6 &amp; 7, 803 (holding that it was, in 1986, \"clearly established\" that policy of routine strip and visual body cavity searches of arrestees was unconstitutional, and citing \"ten opinions from seven circuits\" that refused to condone such searches).  Defendants themselves agree that the search must be evaluated under the reasonableness standard articulated by the 1979 Supreme Court decision in Wolfish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is thus whether an objectively reasonable officer would understand that a strip search of Swain was, under these circumstances, unreasonable.  This prong of the inquiry, while requiring a legal determination, is highly fact specific, and may not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment when material facts are substantially in dispute.  2 Nahmod, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Litigation:  The Law of Section 1983 &#167; 8.08, at 136-39 (3d ed.1991).The ultimate question of whether a reasonable police officer, on the basis of information known to him, could have believed his actions were in accord with constitutional rights is a question of law, subject to resolution by the judge not the jury.

However, disposition of the question on summary judgment is not always possible.  Here, some material facts are significantly in dispute.  Swain's story and that of Officer Hayes conflict on the timing of the relevant events.  Some proffers are supported or contradicted by other witnesses, including Spinney and Milbury.  Hayes contends that, as the officer in charge of the investigation, he ordered the search immediately upon being informed that a narcotics violation had occurred.  The timing of when the search was ordered is essential to a determination of whether defendants' conduct was objectively reasonable.  There are thus factual issues, potentially turning on credibility, that must be resolved by the trier of fact.  Only after the resolution of these conflicts may the trial court apply the relevant law on objective reasonableness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also recognize that police officers are protected in close cases by the doctrine of qualified immunity, and that immunity serves to protect law enforcement from the chilling threat of liability.

If a program does not prevent constitutional violations, municipal decisionmakers may eventually be put on notice that a new program is called for.  Their continued adherence to an approach that they know or should know has failed to prevent tortious conduct by employees may establish the conscious disregard for the consequences of their action--the \"deliberate indifference\"--necessary to trigger municipal liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 117 S.Ct. at 1390 (discussing and citing Canton v.

There was thus \"no notice to the municipal decisionmaker, based on previous violations of federally protected rights, that his approach is inadequate.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has left open the possibility that a failure-to-train claim can succeed without showing a pattern of constitutional violations.  \"[I]n a narrow range of circumstances, a violation of federal rights may be a highly predictable consequence of a failure to equip law enforcement officers with specific tools to handle recurring situations.\"  Id. at 1391.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not that case.  Officer Hayes and Chief Purnell agreed that every officer was supplied with policy guidelines, including periodic updates.  Lieutenant Nolan's memo requiring strip searches to be justified by probable cause was such an update.  The police officers also agreed that the MPI, colloquially known as the \"police manual,\" was to be followed by, and was available to, the North Reading force.  Apparently, not all the officers had a consistent understanding of those materials.  However, it is undisputed that North Reading did have an appropriate policy that was distributed to the force;  absent prior claims, it cannot be reasonably inferred that Chief Purnell knew, or should have known, that his officers were not executing that policy.  Accordingly, Swain cannot make the requisite showing of \"deliberate indifference\" to her constitutional rights.  We affirm the grant of summary judgment as to the Town of North Reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. State Law Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, article 14, gives every person the right to be free from \"unreasonable searches.\"   The Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; 11H, 11I, provides a private right of action for persons who are deprived of rights protected by either federal or state law.  The district court concluded that the protections of article 14 tracked the Fourth Amendment protections of the federal Constitution, and that the search of Swain was reasonable under both federal and state law.  We agree that cases like Rodriques v. Furtado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101534\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101534/rodriques-v-furtado/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">878</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101534\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101534/rodriques-v-furtado/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span> (1991), indicate that the state constitution provides at least the level of protection against strip and visual body cavity searches as does the federal Constitution.  However, in some instances, the Supreme Judicial Court has concluded that \"art[icle] 14 provides more substantive protection to criminal defendants than does the Fourth Amendment.\"  Commonwealth v. Upton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2028985\"><a href=\"/opinion/2028985/commonwealth-v-upton/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2028985\"><a href=\"/opinion/2028985/commonwealth-v-upton/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 556-57 (1985) (rejecting federal standard for determining probable cause based on confidential informant tips);  see also Commonwealth v. Blood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2043844\"><a href=\"/opinion/2043844/commonwealth-v-blood/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2043844\"><a href=\"/opinion/2043844/commonwealth-v-blood/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></a></span> (1987).  The Supreme Judicial Court has also noted that the Massachusetts law on body cavity searches under article 14 remains uncharted territory.  Rodriques, 410 Mass. at 884 n. 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101534\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101534/rodriques-v-furtado/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span>.  The SJC did remark, however, that the federal cases on searches in prisons were not \"germane\" to a body cavity search of a suspect for evidence \"because of the 'diminished' Fourth Amendment rights of prisoners and their visitors.\"  Id. (citations omitted).  This remark certainly suggests the possibility that Massachusetts law might place greater limitations on the use of strip and visual body cavity searches of arrestees than the federal Constitution does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not attempt to predict fully what course Massachusetts law will take.  The Massachusetts Constitution certainly does not provide less protection than federal law.  Having found that the search of Swain may have been objectively unreasonable under the federal Constitution, we conclude that the law of the Commonwealth would at least view the search similarly, and we therefore reinstate her state law claim against the individual defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that Swain cannot prove that her injuries were perpetrated by \"threats, intimidation, or coercion\" as required under Massachusetts law.  See, e.g., Planned Parenthood League v. Blake, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1982112\"><a href=\"/opinion/1982112/planned-parenthood-league-of-massachusetts-v-blake/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1982112\"><a href=\"/opinion/1982112/planned-parenthood-league-of-massachusetts-v-blake/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span>, 990 (1994).  The Supreme Judicial Court has accepted that a \"threat\" may be defined as an \"exertion of pressure to make another fearful or apprehensive of injury or harm\";  that \"intimidation\" may be defined as \"putting [a person] in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct\";  and that \"coercion\" may be defined as the application of physical or moral force so as to force someone to do something she would otherwise not have done.  Id. On the facts here, a jury could find that Officer Hayes used the strip search to humiliate or punish Swain and as a means of exerting moral or psychological pressure designed to weaken her perceived resistance to her questioning.  This could indeed constitute \"intimidation\" or \"coercion\" within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed with respect to the Town of North Reading, and reversed with respect to the individual defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As noted above, the Ninth Circuit has held that, absent a threat to institutional security, the higher showing of probable cause is required to justify such a search.  Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1446</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We also recognize that, under Whren v. United States, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118036\"><a href=\"/opinion/118036/whren-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span> (1996), a police officer's subjective motivations do not serve to invalidate a search for exclusionary rule purposes, so long as the search was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.  Whren, however, also stressed that \"the Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race,\" id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774, and, we would assume, gender.  The exclusionary rule, as the Supreme Court recognized in Malley v. Briggs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 344, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span> (1986), balances different interests than those in a &#167; 1983 action.  (\"While we believe the exclusionary rule serves a necessary purpose, it obviously does so at a considerable cost to the society as a whole, because it excludes evidence probative of guilt....  On the other hand, a damages remedy for [a Fourth Amendment violation] imposes a cost directly on the officer responsible ..., without the side effect of hampering a criminal prosecution.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In St. Hilaire, we noted that the proper division of functions between judge and jury on the objective reasonableness inquiry may be accomplished either through special interrogatories or through carefully structured jury instructions.
