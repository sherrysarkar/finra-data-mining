Appellant Robert Piccolo\n\nseeks to set aside the prison sentence imposed following his\n\nguilty plea to conspiring to possess marijuana with intent to\n\ndistribute, see 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.                  We affirm.\n\n                                       I\n\n                                BACKGROUND\n\n            After the arrests of the three individuals whom Piccolo\n\nhad dispatched to Texas, with $35,000, to acquire 100 pounds of\n\nmarijuana in November 1998, the government initially sought to\n\ninclude, as \"relevant conduct,\" an additional 200 pounds of\n\nmarijuana    which   Piccolo    allegedly      attempted       to    purchase   in\n\nDecember    1998,    an   offense    not     charged     in   the    indictment. 1\n\nFollowing    an   intervening       change    in   the    law,      however,    see\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000),\n\nthe   government     withdrew   its    request      relating        to   \"relevant\n\nconduct,\" and the revised presentence report reflected that\n\nPiccolo was accountable for only the 100 pounds involved in the\n\nattempted November 1998 marijuana purchase.\n\n\n\n      1\n      The additional 200 pounds of marijuana would have increased\nthe statutory maximum sentence to forty years; the base offense\nlevel to 26.      With a three-level downward adjustment for\nacceptance of responsibility, and a four-level upward adjustment\nfor role in the offense, Piccolo's offense level would have been\n27.   And given his category IV criminal history, Piccolo's\nguideline sentencing range would have been between 100 and 125\nmonths.\n\n                                       3\n\f            At sentencing, the district court assigned a base\n\noffense level (\"BOL\") of 20, and an adjusted offense level of\n\n21, (i.e., resulting in a guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") of\n\n57-71 months).         See supra note 1.           As five years is the maximum\n\nprison term for conspiring to possess 100 pounds of marijuana\n\nfor distribution, the court used 60 months as its starting point\n\nfor    calculating       the   downward          departure   recommended       by    the\n\ngovernment in recognition of Piccolo's \"substantial assistance,\"\n\nsee U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1.           The court then imposed a 45-month prison\n\nterm.\n\n                                            II\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n            Piccolo first contends that the district court — in\n\nnoting   that     he    had    received      a    \"break\"    when    the    government\n\nabandoned    its       request    that      the     additional       200    pounds    of\n\nmarijuana    be        considered      \"relevant          conduct\"    —     implicitly\n\nsuggested that it would credit him with that 200 pounds in\n\ndetermining the extent of its § 5K1.1 downward departure, and\n\nthat    absent    such    improper         consideration,      the    court    in    all\n\nlikelihood would have allowed an even larger downward departure,\n\nresulting in a lesser sentence than 45 months.                      We do not agree.\n\n            First,      even     if   we    assume    that    the    district    court\n\nrestricted      its    downward       departure      in    response    to    Piccolo's\n\n\n                                             4\n\faccountability for the additional 200 pounds of marijuana,2 the\n\nPSR    recites        ample   competent     evidence   (e.g.,    statements   by\n\ncriminal associates) implicating him in the December 1998 drug\n\ndeal.       See United States v. Caba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (holding Apprendi inapplicable where resulting sentence\n\ndoes not exceed statutory maximum).\n\n                 Second, Piccolo contends that there is insufficient\n\nrecord support for the four-level upward BOL adjustment imposed\n\nupon       him   as   an   organizer   or   leader   of   a   criminal   venture\n\ninvolving at least four other individuals.                      See U.S.S.G. §\n\n3B1.1(a).         This claim is groundless as well, due to the fact\n\nthat three of the four other conspirators, following their\n\narrests, identified Piccolo as their leader and/or organizer.\n\nSee United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 51 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(\"clear error\" review).3\n\n\n       2\n      The record bears out that the district court's remarks\nsimply constituted an observation regarding the government's\npost-Apprendi decision not to attempt to establish any such\nrelevant conduct, rather than that the court would consider the\n200-pound marijuana purchase in quantifying its downward\ndeparture, which it ascribed exclusively to two very different\nfactors: Piccolo's exemplary military record and his marijuana\ndependency.\n       3\n     Since the PSR contained ample references to Piccolo's\npivotal role in the offense, see United States v. Connolly, 51\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that court may base § 3B1.1\nadjustment on codefendants' hearsay statements), Piccolo's\nprincipal contention on appeal, i.e., that the only evidentiary\nsupport for this adjustment consisted of unsworn assertions by\n\n                                            5\n\f            Lastly, at oral argument Piccolo's counsel pressed the\n\nclaim   —   no   longer     colorable       —   that    the    district    court\n\ncontravened      Apprendi    by   not       requiring    the    government      to\n\nestablish, beyond a reasonable doubt, all facts relied upon in\n\narriving    at   its   determination        that   Piccolo's    \"role     in   the\n\noffense\" was that of an \"organizer\" or \"leader,\" see U.S.S.G. §\n\n3B1.1, cmt. n.4.       The Apprendi contention is plainly precluded\n\nby controlling authority directly on point.                   See, e.g., Caba,\n\n241 F.3d at 101; United States v. LaFreniere, 236 F.3d 41, 49-50\n\n(1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 40-41\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1030 (2001).\n\n            Caba makes crystal clear that Apprendi is inapposite\n\nwhere an upward departure does not result in a sentence which\n\nexceeds the lowest applicable statutory maximum.\n\n            By its own terms, the holding in Apprendi\n            applies only when the disputed \"fact\"\n            enlarges the applicable statutory maximum\n            and the defendant's sentence exceeds the\n            original maximum. For this reason, Apprendi\n            simply does not apply to guideline findings\n            .. . that increase the defendant's sentence,\n            but do not elevate the sentence to a point\n            beyond the lowest applicable statutory\n            maximum.     In other words, even after\n            Apprendi,   the   existence   vel   non   of\n            sentencing factors that boost defendant's\n            sentence but do not trip a new statutory\n\n\ngovernment counsel, see United States v. Patterson, 962 F.2d\n409, 415 (5th Cir. 1992) (finding such assertions insufficient,\n\"by themselves,\" under § 3B1.1) (emphasis added), is groundless.\n\n                                        6\n\f           maximum remain grist for the district\n           judge's   [factfinding]    mill   under a\n           preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.\n\nCaba, 241 F.3d at 101 (emphasis added; citations omitted).\n\n           Piccolo attempts to distinguish Caba on the grounds\n\nthat (i) the four-level increase in the BOL — stemming from the\n\ndistrict court determination that Piccolo was a \"leader or\n\norganizer\" — elevated the GSR above the statutory five-year\n\nmaximum prison term, and (ii) by then employing the improperly\n\nelevated GSR as the starting point from which it proceeded to\n\ncalculate the downward departure which Piccolo was awarded for\n\nsubstantial assistance to the government, see U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1.\n\nPiccolo    presents     neither    sound     argumentation   nor   pertinent\n\nsupporting authority for these distinctions.\n\n           The district court sentenced Piccolo to a forty-five\n\nmonth prison term for conspiring to possess marijuana, with\n\nintent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) &\n\n846.   As the maximum five-year prison sentence prescribed by\n\nstatute,    see 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D), clearly exceeds the\n\nforty-five      month    term     imposed,    Apprendi   plainly    is   not\n\nimplicated.\n\n           We    have   considered     all    the   remaining   contentions\n\nadvanced by Piccolo on appeal; many are meritless attempts to\n\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\fskirt the clear message in Apprendi and Caba and the remainder\n\nwere never preserved below.\n\n         Accordingly, the district court judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              8\n\f",

As five years is the maximum prison term for conspiring to possess 100 pounds of marijuana for distribution, the court used 60 months as its starting point for calculating the downward departure recommended by the government in recognition of Piccolo's \"substantial assistance,\" <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1. The court then imposed a 45-month prison term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Piccolo first contends that the district court &#8212; in noting that he had received a \"break\" when the government abandoned its request that the additional 200 pounds of marijuana be considered \"relevant conduct\" &#8212; implicitly suggested that it would credit him with that 200 pounds in determining the <i>extent</i> of its &#167; 5K1.1 downward departure, and that absent such improper consideration, the court in all likelihood would have allowed an even larger downward departure, resulting in a lesser sentence than 45 months. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, even if we assume that the district court restricted its downward departure in response to Piccolo's accountability for the additional 200 pounds of marijuana,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the PSR recites ample competent evidence (<i>e.g.,</i> statements by criminal associates) implicating him in the December 1998 drug deal. <i>See United States v. Caba,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199298\"><a href=\"/opinion/199298/united-states-v-caba/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 101 (1st Cir.2001) (holding <i>Apprendi</i> inapplicable where resulting sentence does not exceed statutory maximum).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Piccolo contends that there is insufficient record support for the fourlevel upward BOL adjustment imposed upon him as an organizer or leader of a criminal venture involving at least four <i>other</i> individuals. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a). This claim is groundless as well, due to the fact that three of the four other conspirators, following their arrests, identified Piccolo as their leader and/or organizer. <i>See United States v. Scott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775404\"><a href=\"/opinion/775404/united-states-v-alan-n-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.2001) (\"clear error\" review).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, at oral argument Piccolo's counsel pressed the claim &#8212; no longer colorable &#8212; that the district court contravened <i>Apprendi</i> by not requiring the government to establish, <i>beyond a reasonable doubt,</i> all facts relied upon in arriving at its determination that Piccolo's \"role in the offense\" was that of an \"organizer\" or \"leader,\" <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, cmt. n.4. The <i>Apprendi</i> contention is plainly precluded by controlling authority directly on point. <i>See, e.g., Caba,</i> 241 F.3d at 101; <i>United States v.

As the maximum five-year prison sentence prescribed by statute, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(D), clearly exceeds the forty-five month term imposed, <i>Apprendi</i> plainly is not implicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered all the remaining contentions advanced by Piccolo on appeal; many are meritless attempts to skirt the clear message in <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Caba</i> and the remainder were never preserved below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court <i>judgment is affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The additional 200 pounds of marijuana would have increased the statutory maximum sentence to forty years; the base offense level to 26.
