Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we find no merit in defendant's belated claim that his\r\nplea was invalid.  The district court was not obligated to\r\nprovide the detailed instruction suggested by defendant, and,\r\nin addition, it is implausible that the omitted information\r\nwould have made any material difference in defendant's decision\r\nto plead guilty.  Defendant has not shown \"a fundamental defect\r\nwhich inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice\r\n. . . or an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands\r\nof fair procedure.\"  United States v. Lopez-Pineda, 55 F.3d\r\n693, 696-97 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal citations and quotations\r\nomitted).\r\n          Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of\r\ncounsel also fails.  Even assuming arguendo that defendant's\r\nfactual assertions were true, in all the circumstances of this\r\ncase, we cannot say that defendant's attorney was required to\r\nadvise what we view as a \"very dangerous course.\"  See United\r\nStates v. Montanez, 82 F.3d 520, 523 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
