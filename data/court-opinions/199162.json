PHOENIX,\n\n                      Petitioner, Appellant,\n\n                                  v.\n\n                          JAMES MATESANZ,\n\n                       Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n        [Hon. Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                      Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n                   Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Robert L. Sheketoff, with whom Sheketoff & Homan was on brief, for\nappellant.\n     William J. Meade, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau,\nwith whom Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\fDecember 1, 2000\n\n\n\n\n      -2-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.      According to the prosecution,\n\nKenneth Phoenix \"almost committed the perfect crime . . . except for\n\none mistake.\" Based on that mistake -- a blood-soaked fingerprint left\n\nnear the scene -- Phoenix was convicted of the first degree murder of\n\nRaymond Green. Although Phoenix's defense counsel cross-examined the\n\nforensic serologist and fingerprint experts presented by the\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, he did not call defense experts to\n\nfurther contradict their testimony.      Phoenix now claims that his\n\nattorney's decision not to call such experts denied him his\n\nconstitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. Having had\n\nhis petition for a writ of habeas corpus denied by the district court,\n\nhe appeals to this Court. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the\n\ndecision of the district court.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          As our previous decision, Phoenix v. Matesanz, 189 F.3d 20,\n\n22-24 (1st Cir. 1999), summarizes this case's procedural history prior\n\nto the district court's denial of habeas, we need provide only a brief\n\nsummary here.\n\n          Raymond Green was a plant manager at the Belchertown State\n\nSchool. On August 4, 1986, he was found dead in his office, shot five\n\ntimes. Police found pieces of a green scouring pad on his face and on\n\nthe floor of his office, as well as in a metal drum on the first floor\n\nof the plant. In that drum police also found a crumpled brown paper\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fbag. Fingerprints and blood were found on the paper bag. Two experts\n\npresented by the Commonwealth testified at trial that the identifiable\n\nfingerprints on the bag belonged to Phoenix, who was one of 63\n\nemployees supervised by Green. Expert serologist Dr. Moses Schanfield\n\ntestified that the blood from the only successfully tested blood stain\n\nwas consistent with Green's blood and inconsistent with Phoenix's\n\nblood. Based largely on these two pieces of incriminating evidence,\n\nPhoenix was convicted.\n\n          Although Phoenix's counsel, William Bennett, had retained a\n\nforensic serologist and a fingerprint analyst, he called neither to\n\ntestify. The serologist, Dr. Brian Wraxall, later filed an affidavit\n\nstating that he would have testified that the allotype blood test\n\nperformed by Schanfield yielded scientifically meaningless results.\n\nWraxall would have further testified that no scientific basis existed\n\nto conclude that the tested stain was either consistent with Green's\n\nblood or inconsistent with Phoenix's blood. The fingerprint expert,\n\nHerbert MacDonnell, filed an affidavit stating that the fingerprint\n\nlacked sufficient detail to be identified either as Phoenix's or not\n\nPhoenix's.\n\n          After Phoenix's direct appeals were denied, ultimately by the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Commonwealth v. Phoenix, 567\n\nN.E.2d 193 (Mass. 1991), he filed a second motion for a new trial\n\nclaiming that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel based\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fon Bennett's failure to call Wraxall and MacDonnell. The Superior\n\nCourt denied his motion, as did a single gatekeeper justice of the SJC.\n\nThe federal district court then found that Phoenix was not procedurally\n\nbarred from filing a habeas petition based on ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel, a decision we affirmed. See Phoenix v. Matesanz, 189 F.3d 20\n\n(1st Cir. 1999). After remand, the district court ruled on the merits\n\nof Phoenix's petition, ultimately concluding that the state court\n\ndecisions did not involve an unreasonable application of the Strickland\n\nv. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), standard for determining\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nI.   Applying the habeas corpus statute\n\n          In enacting the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\n\n(AEDPA), Congress placed new restrictions on the power of federal\n\ncourts to grant writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners. As relevant\n\nhere, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) was revised to provide:\n\n          (d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on\n          behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the\n          judgment of a State court shall not be granted\n          with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on\n          the merits in State court proceedings unless the\n          adjudication of the claim -\n          (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to,\n          or involved an unreasonable application of,\n          clearly established Federal law, as determined by\n          the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          Until last Term, the Supreme Court had not been presented\n\nwith the opportunity to elucidate the meaning of the revised provision,\n\nand the various courts of appeals, including this Court, had been left\n\nto take our best shots. See, e.g., Green v. French, 153 F.3d 865 (4th\n\nCir. 1998); O'Brien v. DuBois, 145 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 1998); Drinkard v.\n\nJohnson, 97 F.3d 751 (5th Cir. 1996); Lindh v. Murphy, 96 F.3d 856 (7th\n\nCir. 1996). However, in Williams v. Taylor, 120 S. Ct. 1495 (2000),\n\nthe Supreme Court provided the first explicit guidance on the\n\nconstruction of this section of the AEDPA, fortuitously in the very\n\ncontext of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.1 It is to this\n\ndecision that we must now turn.\n\n          Addressing a case out of the Fourth Circuit, Williams v.\n\nTaylor, 163 F.3d 860 (4th Cir. 1998), the Supreme Court generally\n\nupheld Green's interpretation of § 2254(d)(1), albeit with several\n\nsignificant differences. The Court began by sustaining the Green\n\nconception of the \"contrary to\" clause, holding that the clause applied\n\nin two types of situations.    First, \"a state-court decision will\n\ncertainly be contrary to our clearly established precedent if the state\n\ncourt applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in\n\n[Supreme Court] cases.\" Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1519. For example,\n\n1 In Williams, Justice O'Connor delivered the section of the majority\nopinion interpreting § 2254(d)(1), see Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1518-23,\nbut Justice Stevens delivered the section applying the Strickland test\nto the facts at hand, see id. at 1512-16. Williams was decided after\nthe briefs were filed in this case.\n\n                                 -6-\n\frequiring a petitioner to meet a higher burden than that provided for\n\nin Strickland would be contrary to clearly established Supreme Court\n\nprecedent.   See id. Second, \"a state-court decision will also be\n\ncontrary to this Court's clearly established precedent if [it]\n\nconfronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a\n\n[Supreme Court decision] and nevertheless arrives at a [different\n\nresult].\" Id. at 1519-20. However, Justice O'Connor noted that the\n\nrun-of-the-mill state-court case, applying the correct legal rule to a\n\nnew set of facts, would not fit comfortably within the \"contrary to\"\n\nclause of § 2254(d)(1). To place such a case within that clause would\n\nsap the \"unreasonable application\" clause of any meaning.          See id.\n\n          The Court then found that the Fourth Circuit was again\n\ngenerally correct as to its interpretation of the \"unreasonable\n\napplication\" clause. Green held that an \"unreasonable application\" of\n\nSupreme Court precedent occurs when (i) \"the state court identifies the\n\ncorrect governing legal rule . . . but unreasonably applies it to the\n\nfacts of the particular [case],\" and (ii) when \"the state court either\n\nunreasonably extends a legal principle from [Supreme Court] precedent\n\nto a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to\n\nextend that principle to a new context where it should apply.\" Id. at\n\n1520 (citing Green, 153 F.3d at 869-70). The Court endorsed the first\n\napproach, see id. at 1520-21, while withholding judgment on the second,\n\nsee id. at 1521.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          However, the Court refused to endorse the Fourth Circuit's\n\ndetermination of \"what exactly qualifies\" as an unreasonable\n\napplication of law under § 2254(d)(1). Green limited unreasonable\n\napplications to those cases where all reasonable jurists would agree\n\nthat the state court application of law is unreasonable. See Green,\n\n153 F.3d at 870. The Supreme Court concluded that such an approach\n\nprovides little assistance to federal courts, and is in fact misleading\n\nin its subjectivity. See Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1521 (noting that\n\nunder such a standard, any conflicting authority, including a 2-1\n\nsplit, would foreclose review). Instead, the federal habeas court\n\n\"should ask whether the state court's application of clearly\n\nestablished federal law was objectively unreasonable.\" Id. Although\n\n\"unreasonable\" may be difficult to define, Justice O'Connor noted that\n\nit is a term familiar to the legal world and to federal judges. At the\n\nvery least, an unreasonable application of federal law differs from an\n\nincorrect application of federal law. See id. at 1522 (citing Wright\n\nv. West, 505 U.S. 277, 287 (1992), for this distinction). In sum,\n\n\"[u]nder § 2254(d)(1)'s 'unreasonable application' clause, a federal\n\nhabeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes\n\nin its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision\n\napplied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.\n\nRather, that application must also be unreasonable.\"         Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          Finally, Justice O'Connor noted that so-called \"old rules\"\n\nunder Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), would qualify as \"clearly\n\nestablished Federal law,\" the only caveat being that post-AEDPA, such\n\n\"old rules\" could only stem from the Supreme Court's jurisprudence.\n\nSee Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1523.\n\n          The Supreme Court then applied its Williams v. Taylor\n\nanalysis to the denial of effective assistance of counsel, concluding\n\nthat \"[i]t is past question that the rule set forth in [ Strickland]\n\nqualifies as 'clearly established law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt of the United States.'\" Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1512. The Court\n\nnoted that the Strickland test, \"of necessity,\" requires a case-by-case\n\nexamination of the evidence, but held that such case-specific concerns\n\n\"obviate neither the clarity of the rule nor the extent to which the\n\nrule must be seen as 'established' by this Court.\"         Id.\n\nII.   The Strickland Standard\n\n          The Court in Williams nicely summarized the relevant aspects\n\nof the Strickland test:\n\n                  [A] violation of the right [to effective\n          assistance of counsel] has two components:\n                  \"First, the defendant must show that\n          counsel's performance was deficient.         This\n          requires showing that counsel made errors so\n          serious that counsel was not functioning as the\n          'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\n          Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that\n          the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\n          This requires showing that counsel's errors were\n          so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\"\n          Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687.\n                  To establish ineffectiveness, a \"defendant\n          must show that counsel's representation fell\n          below an objective standard of reasonableness.\"\n          Id. at 688. To establish prejudice, he \"must\n          show that there is a reasonable probability that,\n          but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the\n          result of the proceeding would have been\n          different.     A reasonable probability is a\n          probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\n          the outcome.\" Id. at 694.\n\nWilliams, 120 S. Ct. at 1511-12.\n\n          In Strickland itself the Supreme Court spoke in more detail\n\nabout the deferential level of scrutiny involved in this review,\n\nparticularly with respect to potentially strategic decisions made by\n\ncounsel. The Court cautioned as to the use of hindsight: \"It is all\n\ntoo tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel's assistance after\n\nconviction . . . , and it is all too easy for a court, examining\n\ncounsel's defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a\n\nparticular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.\" Strickland,\n\n466 U.S at 689; see also United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 310\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (cautioning that \"[the fact that] counsel's selection\n\nof a stratagem may, in retrospect, have proved unsuccessful, or even\n\nunwise, is not the issue\"). The defendant, as a result, must \"overcome\n\nthe presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action\n\n'might be considered sound trial strategy.'\" Id. (quoting Michel v.\n\nLouisiana, 350 U.S. 91, 101 (1955)). Specifically, a court must judge\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe reasonableness of counsel's challenged conduct on the facts of the\n\ncase at the time of that conduct. Moreover, \"counsel is strongly\n\npresumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant\n\ndecisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\" Id. at\n\n690. In short, \"strategic choices made after thorough investigation of\n\nlaw   and   facts   relevant   to   plausible   options   are   virtually\n\nunchallengeable.\"      Id. (emphasis added).2\n\n\n\n\n2 We should note that \" virtually unchallengeable\" does differ from\n\"unchallengeable.\" Our overall task according to Strickland is to\ndetermine whether the challenged \"acts or omissions [are] outside the\nwide range of professionally competent assistance.\" Strickland, 466\nU.S. at 690. In making this statement, the Supreme Court cited with\napproval the Court of Appeals approach to strategic decision-making,\nwhich had in fact allowed challenges when \"the choice was so patently\nunreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it.\"\nWashington v. Strickland, 693 F.2d 1243, 1254 (5th Cir. 1982).\n\n                                    -11-\n\fIII.   Application to Phoenix's Appeal\n\n          Under Strickland, we must ask whether defense counsel's\n\ndecision not to call either defense expert was an act that falls below\n\n\"an objective standard of reasonableness.\" However, if the state court\n\napplied the correct test, we cannot answer this question de novo. See\n\nWilliams, 120 S. Ct. at 1519-20 (holding that application of the\n\nStrickland test is under the unreasonable application prong of §\n\n2254(d)(1)). Although Justice Fried, as single gatekeeper justice of\n\nthe SJC, did not cite Strickland in his analysis, it is clear from his\n\nlanguage that his decision denying Phoenix's motion was based on the\n\njudgment that the failure to call Wraxall was a strategic choice:\n\n          It is this strategy which defendant now claims\n          amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.\n          The defendant claims that if only the expert\n          witness, Dr. Wraxall, had been called to testify,\n          it would have had a damaging effect on the\n          Commonwealth's own expert testimony regarding the\n          crucial blood testimony. But the subject of the\n          reliability of the Commonwealth's testimony on\n          this score had been so thoroughly canvassed both\n          at trial, by cross-examination by defendant's\n          counsel, and then examined by the full court on\n          plenary review, that I think the claim of\n          ineffectiveness of counsel is so far-fetched as\n          to be insubstantial.\n\nPhoenix v. Commonwealth, No. SJ-96-0571, at 4-5 (SJC Memorandum, Fried,\n\nJ., May 8, 1997). The strategy to which Justice Fried referred was\n\ndescribed in the prior decision of the full SJC. See Commonwealth v.\n\nPhoenix, 409 Mass. 408, 421 n.8 (1991). In denying leave to admit into\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fthe record on direct appeal the Wraxall affidavit, the SJC referred to\n\ndefendant's arguments that he did not have Wraxall testify because of\n\nthe expense and because of his belief that Schanfield's testimony would\n\nexpose the unreliability of the critical test. The court concluded\n\nthat \"[t]hese considerations were purely ones of trial strategy, and,\n\ntherefore, there is no reason to permit the filing of the affidavit.\"\n\nId.\n\n          As for the fingerprint evidence, Judge Moriarty of the\n\nMassachusetts Superior Court plainly found that the failure to call\n\nMacDonnell was a strategic one. See Commonwealth v. Phoenix, No. 87-\n\n068, at 8 (Superior Court Memorandum, Moriarty, J., March 18, 1996)\n\n(\"[Bennett] made a tactical decision - and probably a wise one.\").\n\n          Hence, we must assess whether the respective state court\n\napplications of Strickland to these ineffective assistance claims was\n\nin fact objectively unreasonable. In other words, were the state court\n\nfindings that Bennett made strategic choices in not calling either\n\nWraxall or MacDonell reasonable determinations? Cf. Tucker v. Catoe,\n\n221 F.3d 600 (4th Cir. 2000) (applying Williams/Strickland analysis in\n\na similar manner); Barnabei v. Angelone, 214 F.3d 463, 469 (4th Cir.\n\n2000) (recognizing \"the legal effect of the prior state court\n\nadjudication while independently reviewing the issues raised\").\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f          We make this assessment under the guidance of our decision\n\nin Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 53 (1st Cir. 1993).3 In Lema,\n\nwe denied an ineffective assistance claim based on counsel's failure to\n\ncall three witnesses proposed by the defendant. We noted that \"[t]he\n\ndecision whether to call a particular witness is almost always\n\nstrategic, requiring a balancing of the benefits and risks of the\n\nanticipated testimony.\" Id. at 54. \"Where the prosecution's case is\n\nless than compelling . . . the risk of 'rocking the boat' may warrant\n\na decision by trial counsel to forego the presentation of further\n\ndefense testimony, even favorable testimony.\" Id. (citing Johnson v.\n\nLockhart, 921 F.2d 796, 800 (8th Cir. 1990)). Moreover, choices in\n\nemphasis during cross-examination are prototypical examples of\n\nunchallengeable strategy. See Matthews v. Rakiey, 54 F.3d 908, 916-18\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          We now examine each claim in turn.\n\n          A.   The Fingerprint Evidence\n\n          In response to the prosecution experts' identification of his\n\nclient's prints and exclusion of another suspect's prints, Bennett\n\ncross-examined the Commonwealth's two fingerprint experts both at voir\n\n\n\n3  Although decisions issuing from this Court are not \"clearly\nestablished\" for the purposes of § 2254(d)(1) because they do not issue\nfrom the Supreme Court, they provide significant insight on what\nconstitutes reasonableness for a particular fact pattern. Cf. Clark v.\nStinson, 214 F.3d 315, 327 n.8 (2d Cir. 2000) (citing New York state\nlaw for guidance as to the reasonableness of waiver).\n\n                                 -14-\n\fdire and at trial. Bennett challenged whether the paper bag had been\n\ntreated for prints at the appropriate time and in the appropriate\n\nmanner; he exposed that the expert worked only from photographs, rather\n\nthan from the paper bag itself; and he raised questions about the chain\n\nof custody.    Bennett also spent a significant amount of time\n\nquestioning the methodology of one of the Commonwealth experts\n\n(Shiflett), particularly with regard to discrepancies between the paper\n\nbag print and the comparison print.       In particular, his cross-\n\nexamination prompted Shiflett to testify that the quality of the print\n\nhad limited his observations and that the print on the paper bag was\n\n\"similar to\" but not \"identical\" to the print taken from Phoenix used\n\nfor purposes of comparison.\n\n          Defense expert MacDonnell submitted an affidavit stating\n\nthat, in his opinion, the \"quality of the fingerprint evidence is\n\ninadequate . . . to make a positive ID,\" and as a result he could not\n\n\"conclude with certainty that the unknown [print] is not from Phoenix.\"\n\nMacDonnell could only testify in response to the prosecution's experts\n\nthat identification of the fingerprint was impossible, in his opinion.\n\nHe could not identify the fingerprint as that of another potential\n\nsuspect. He could not say, for certain, that the fingerprint did not\n\nbelong to Phoenix. Although Bennett had not thoroughly discredited the\n\nCommonwealth's fingerprint experts at trial, he had made substantial\n\nprogress in this direction. It is possible that, given his progress\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fduring cross-examination, the limitations of MacDonnell's testimony,\n\nand the threat of exhaustive cross-examination of his own expert,\n\nBennett made a strategic decision not to call him. Judge Moriarty of\n\nthe Massachusetts Superior Court so concluded. We cannot say that such\n\na finding was objectively unreasonable, even if we might have found\n\ndifferently. See Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1522 (distinction between\n\n\"incorrect\" and \"unreasonable\"); see also Tucker, 221 F.3d at 614\n\n(finding that on a close issue, the appellate court can disagree with\n\nthe state court without the state court decision having been\n\nunreasonable); Barnabei, 214 F.3d at 469 (same).\n\n          We also cannot conclude that Bennett's failure to send\n\nMacDonnell additional photographs for review during and after trial\n\nconstituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Although it turned out\n\nthat MacDonnell's opinion of the additional photographs would probably\n\nhave been helpful at trial, Bennett's choice not to pursue further\n\ninvestigation on this front was a reasonable one at trial.\n\nMacDonnell's partially provided expert opinion had lowered Bennett's\n\nexpectations and Bennett had adequately cross-examined the Commonwealth\n\nwitnesses. Even with the stronger evidence, MacDonnell could still not\n\ntestify that the print did not belong to Phoenix. Defense counsel is\n\nallowed to make strategic decisions, within the wide bounds of\n\nprofessional competence, as to which leads to follow up, and on which\n\nareas to focus his energies. This is especially true during trial,\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fwhen time is short. See, e.g., Genius v. Pepe, 147 F.3d 64, 67 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).    Given our understanding of Bennett's failure to send\n\nMacDonnell additional photographs as a strategic choice at trial, we\n\ncannot find the state court's decision on this issue an unreasonable\n\napplication of Strickland.\n\n          B.   The Blood Evidence\n\n          The blood evidence presents a more difficult case, simply\n\nbecause the defense expert affidavit promised much more. Wraxall\n\noffered to testify that: (1) the blood on the paper bag was not the\n\nresult of \"blowback\" (i.e., blood splattered from the victim after he\n\nwas shot); (2) the results of the May 11 test were \"scientifically\n\nmeaningless\" and \"not the proper basis for a scientific opinion;\" (3)\n\nprosecution expert Schanfield's methodology was unreliable in important\n\naspects; (4) taken as a whole, the blood evidence was not consistent\n\nwith the victim, and Schanfield's statement to the contrary was\n\nmisleading; and (5) the blood could have been taken from anyone in the\n\npopulation. Wraxall also noted that he would not have been able to\n\nperform independent testing on the samples, because Schanfield had\n\nirreparably altered them and the prosecutors had requested their\n\nreturn.\n\n          At the voir dire, Bennett spent several hours cross-examining\n\nSchanfield and posed significant questions to the reliability of his\n\ntestimony. As a result, the trial judge only allowed Schanfield to\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fmake conclusions based on the May 11 tests. At trial, Bennett engaged\n\nin further cross-examination of Schanfield. Bennett was able to (1)\n\nexpose problems with the control samples; (2) suggest what the problems\n\nwith controls might mean for the reliability of the test as a whole;\n\n(3) prompt Schanfield to testify that he could not say, based on the\n\nMay 11 test, that the blood was that of Green; (4) clarify that the\n\ntest had yielded little in the way of interpretable results; (5)\n\nindicate inconsistencies in the testing of one potentially relevant\n\nblood allotype (the \"N\" allotype); (6) get Schanfield to describe\n\ncertain inconsistencies as \"false positives;\" and (7) get Schanfield to\n\nadmit inconsistencies among tests taken just 30 minutes apart. At the\n\nvery least, even upon reading a cold record, Bennett's cross-\n\nexamination at trial posed significant questions to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of Schanfield's test and his interpretation of the test\n\nresults. The mere fact that Bennett's cross-examination failed to\n\npersuade the jury of Phoenix's innocence is not enough to establish\n\nineffective assistance.\n\n          At best, Wraxall's testimony could have added to Bennett's\n\ncross-examination by further discrediting Schanfield. Wraxall could\n\nhave provided additional evidence challenging Schanfield's scientific\n\nmethods and testing. He could have given the jury a reason to believe\n\nthat the blood was not consistent with Green's. The jury would have\n\nheard that, because the blood was not the result of \"blowback,\" it had\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fnot been deposited on the paper bag in the manner Schanfield suggested.\n\nHowever, Wraxall could not testify that the blood was not Green's; in\n\nfact, he would not testify that the blood belonged to or did not belong\n\nto any specific person. In short, he would support Bennett's cross-\n\nexamination attempt, but not provide any significant new facts or\n\nevidence that might lead the jury to an alternate explanation. As\n\nsuch, we can see that Bennett might have made a strategic decision not\n\nto call him: to call Wraxall would reinforce the lack of an alternative\n\nexplanation, would open his own expert to cross-examination, and might\n\nsimply do no good. See United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 227-28\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (no ineffective assistance claim based on counsel's\n\ndecision not to call witness, after \"skillful cross-examination\" had\n\nelicited much the same opinion evidence that counsel had hoped to\n\nestablish through defense witness). Upon consideration of the record\n\nand Wraxall's affidavit, we cannot find that Justice Fried's\n\nunderstanding of Bennett's action as within the bounds of permissible\n\nstrategic choice is objectively unreasonable. Thus we may not grant a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus on this basis.\n\n          We also cannot conclude that the state court's refusal to\n\ngrant a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel was\n\nunreasonable based on Bennett's so-called \"promise\" to the jury.\n\nPhoenix bases this claim on a sentence of the opening statement in\n\nwhich Bennett noted that \"if anything, tests will show that . . . some\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fof the blood that was on the bag . . . could not have been the blood of\n\nRay Green.\"   It is true that no testimony explicitly showed this\n\n\"promised\" fact.    However, given that (i) Bennett used the \"if\n\nanything\" disclaimer; (ii) Wraxall would not have testified as\n\nsupposedly promised, but only that Schanfield's testing was fatally\n\nflawed; and (iii) Bennett's cross-examination of Schanfield had\n\nattempted, and potentially achieved, the same result, we cannot\n\nconclude that Bennett either made a promise or that any promise he made\n\nwent unfulfilled. Moreover, our cases that premise a habeas writ on an\n\nunfulfilled promise during opening argument generally require greater\n\nspecificity in the promise and greater contemporaneousness between the\n\npromise and jury deliberations. Compare Anderson v. Butler, 858 F.2d\n\n16, 19 (1st Cir. 1988) (ineffective assistance found upon explicit\n\npromise to call psychiatric witness made a day prior to jury\n\ndeliberations, where voir dire had focused on jury willingness to\n\naccept such testimony), with McGill, 11 F.3d at 227-28 (decision not to\n\ncall previously promised witness who had \"feet of clay\" not ineffective\n\nassistance). The promise here was neither \"dramatic\" nor was the\n\nindicated testimony \"strikingly significant.\" Anderson, 858 F.2d at\n\n17.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          We note that in the pre-Williams world, we would occasionally\n\nremand to the district court for hearings on whether an action was\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fwithin the allowable bounds of strategic choice or not. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Rodríguez-Rodríguez, 929 F.2d 747, 752 (1st Cir.\n\n1991). The holding of Williams dictates that we do not do so here.\n\nOur only question is whether the state judge's decision that defense\n\ncounsel made a permissible strategic choice was objectively reasonable.\n\nBecause we find that it was, we affirm the district court's denial of\n\nthe writ of habeas corpus.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f",

According to the prosecution,\n\nKenneth Phoenix \"almost committed the perfect crime . . . except for\n\none mistake.\" Based on that mistake -- a blood-soaked fingerprint left\n\nnear the scene -- Phoenix was convicted of the first degree murder of\n\nRaymond Green. Although Phoenix's defense counsel cross-examined the\n\nforensic serologist and fingerprint experts presented by the\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, he did not call defense experts to\n\nfurther contradict their testimony.      Phoenix now claims that his\n\nattorney's decision not to call such experts denied him his\n\nconstitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. Having had\n\nhis petition for a writ of habeas corpus denied by the district court,\n\nhe appeals to this Court. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the\n\ndecision of the district court.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          As our previous decision, Phoenix v.

On August 4, 1986, he was found dead in his office, shot five\n\ntimes. Police found pieces of a green scouring pad on his face and on\n\nthe floor of his office, as well as in a metal drum on the first floor\n\nof the plant. In that drum police also found a crumpled brown paper\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fbag. Fingerprints and blood were found on the paper bag. Two experts\n\npresented by the Commonwealth testified at trial that the identifiable\n\nfingerprints on the bag belonged to Phoenix, who was one of 63\n\nemployees supervised by Green. Expert serologist Dr. Moses Schanfield\n\ntestified that the blood from the only successfully tested blood stain\n\nwas consistent with Green's blood and inconsistent with Phoenix's\n\nblood. Based largely on these two pieces of incriminating evidence,\n\nPhoenix was convicted.\n\n          Although Phoenix's counsel, William Bennett, had retained a\n\nforensic serologist and a fingerprint analyst, he called neither to\n\ntestify. The serologist, Dr. Brian Wraxall, later filed an affidavit\n\nstating that he would have testified that the allotype blood test\n\nperformed by Schanfield yielded scientifically meaningless results.\n\nWraxall would have further testified that no scientific basis existed\n\nto conclude that the tested stain was either consistent with Green's\n\nblood or inconsistent with Phoenix's blood. The fingerprint expert,\n\nHerbert MacDonnell, filed an affidavit stating that the fingerprint\n\nlacked sufficient detail to be identified either as Phoenix's or not\n\nPhoenix's.\n\n          After Phoenix's direct appeals were denied, ultimately by the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Commonwealth v.

The Superior\n\nCourt denied his motion, as did a single gatekeeper justice of the SJC.\n\nThe federal district court then found that Phoenix was not procedurally\n\nbarred from filing a habeas petition based on ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel, a decision we affirmed.

Applying the habeas corpus statute\n\n          In enacting the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\n\n(AEDPA), Congress placed new restrictions on the power of federal\n\ncourts to grant writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners. As relevant\n\nhere, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) was revised to provide:\n\n          (d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on\n          behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the\n          judgment of a State court shall not be granted\n          with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on\n          the merits in State court proceedings unless the\n          adjudication of the claim -\n          (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to,\n          or involved an unreasonable application of,\n          clearly established Federal law, as determined by\n          the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          Until last Term, the Supreme Court had not been presented\n\nwith the opportunity to elucidate the meaning of the revised provision,\n\nand the various courts of appeals, including this Court, had been left\n\nto take our best shots.

However, in Williams v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000),\n\nthe Supreme Court provided the first explicit guidance on the\n\nconstruction of this section of the AEDPA, fortuitously in the very\n\ncontext of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.1 It is to this\n\ndecision that we must now turn.\n\n          Addressing a case out of the Fourth Circuit, Williams v.\n\nTaylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760197\"><a href=\"/opinion/760197/terry-williams-v-john-taylor-warden-sussex-i-state-prison-terry/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1998), the Supreme Court generally\n\nupheld Green's interpretation of § 2254(d)(1), albeit with several\n\nsignificant differences. The Court began by sustaining the Green\n\nconception of the \"contrary to\" clause, holding that the clause applied\n\nin two types of situations.    First, \"a state-court decision will\n\ncertainly be contrary to our clearly established precedent if the state\n\ncourt applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in\n\n[Supreme Court] cases.\" Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1519. For example,\n\n1 In Williams, Justice O'Connor delivered the section of the majority\nopinion interpreting § 2254(d)(1), see Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1518-23,\nbut Justice Stevens delivered the section applying the Strickland test\nto the facts at hand, see id. at 1512-16. Williams was decided after\nthe briefs were filed in this case.\n\n                                 -6-\n\frequiring a petitioner to meet a higher burden than that provided for\n\nin Strickland would be contrary to clearly established Supreme Court\n\nprecedent.   See id. Second, \"a state-court decision will also be\n\ncontrary to this Court's clearly established precedent if [it]\n\nconfronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a\n\n[Supreme Court decision] and nevertheless arrives at a [different\n\nresult].\" Id. at 1519-20. However, Justice O'Connor noted that the\n\nrun-of-the-mill state-court case, applying the correct legal rule to a\n\nnew set of facts, would not fit comfortably within the \"contrary to\"\n\nclause of § 2254(d)(1). To place such a case within that clause would\n\nsap the \"unreasonable application\" clause of any meaning.          See id.\n\n          The Court then found that the Fourth Circuit was again\n\ngenerally correct as to its interpretation of the \"unreasonable\n\napplication\" clause. Green held that an \"unreasonable application\" of\n\nSupreme Court precedent occurs when (i) \"the state court identifies the\n\ncorrect governing legal rule . . . but unreasonably applies it to the\n\nfacts of the particular [case],\" and (ii) when \"the state court either\n\nunreasonably extends a legal principle from [Supreme Court] precedent\n\nto a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to\n\nextend that principle to a new context where it should apply.\" Id. at\n\n1520 (citing Green, 153 F.3d at 869-70). The Court endorsed the first\n\napproach, see id. at 1520-21, while withholding judgment on the second,\n\nsee id. at 1521.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          However, the Court refused to endorse the Fourth Circuit's\n\ndetermination of \"what exactly qualifies\" as an unreasonable\n\napplication of law under § 2254(d)(1). Green limited unreasonable\n\napplications to those cases where all reasonable jurists would agree\n\nthat the state court application of law is unreasonable. See Green,\n\n153 F.3d at 870. The Supreme Court concluded that such an approach\n\nprovides little assistance to federal courts, and is in fact misleading\n\nin its subjectivity. See Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1521 (noting that\n\nunder such a standard, any conflicting authority, including a 2-1\n\nsplit, would foreclose review). Instead, the federal habeas court\n\n\"should ask whether the state court's application of clearly\n\nestablished federal law was objectively unreasonable.\" Id. Although\n\n\"unreasonable\" may be difficult to define, Justice O'Connor noted that\n\nit is a term familiar to the legal world and to federal judges. At the\n\nvery least, an unreasonable application of federal law differs from an\n\nincorrect application of federal law. See id. at 1522 (citing Wright\n\nv. West, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112771\"><a href=\"/opinion/112771/wright-v-west/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 287 (1992), for this distinction). In sum,\n\n\"[u]nder § 2254(d)(1)'s 'unreasonable application' clause, a federal\n\nhabeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes\n\nin its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision\n\napplied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.\n\nRather, that application must also be unreasonable.\"         Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          Finally, Justice O'Connor noted that so-called \"old rules\"\n\nunder Teague v. Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989), would qualify as \"clearly\n\nestablished Federal law,\" the only caveat being that post-AEDPA, such\n\n\"old rules\" could only stem from the Supreme Court's jurisprudence.\n\nSee Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1523.\n\n          The Supreme Court then applied its Williams v. Taylor\n\nanalysis to the denial of effective assistance of counsel, concluding\n\nthat \"[i]t is past question that the rule set forth in [ Strickland]\n\nqualifies as 'clearly established law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt of the United States.'\" Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1512. The Court\n\nnoted that the Strickland test, \"of necessity,\" requires a case-by-case\n\nexamination of the evidence, but held that such case-specific concerns\n\n\"obviate neither the clarity of the rule nor the extent to which the\n\nrule must be seen as 'established' by this Court.\"         Id.\n\nII.   The Strickland Standard\n\n          The Court in Williams nicely summarized the relevant aspects\n\nof the Strickland test:\n\n                  [A] violation of the right [to effective\n          assistance of counsel] has two components:\n                  \"First, the defendant must show that\n          counsel's performance was deficient.         This\n          requires showing that counsel made errors so\n          serious that counsel was not functioning as the\n          'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\n          Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that\n          the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\n          This requires showing that counsel's errors were\n          so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\"\n          Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687.\n                  To establish ineffectiveness, a \"defendant\n          must show that counsel's representation fell\n          below an objective standard of reasonableness.\"\n          Id. at 688. To establish prejudice, he \"must\n          show that there is a reasonable probability that,\n          but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the\n          result of the proceeding would have been\n          different.     A reasonable probability is a\n          probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\n          the outcome.\" Id. at 694.\n\nWilliams, 120 S. Ct. at 1511-12.\n\n          In Strickland itself the Supreme Court spoke in more detail\n\nabout the deferential level of scrutiny involved in this review,\n\nparticularly with respect to potentially strategic decisions made by\n\ncounsel. The Court cautioned as to the use of hindsight: \"It is all\n\ntoo tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel's assistance after\n\nconviction . . . , and it is all too easy for a court, examining\n\ncounsel's defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a\n\nparticular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.\" Strickland,\n\n466 U.S at 689; see also United States v. Natanel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (cautioning that \"[the fact that] counsel's selection\n\nof a stratagem may, in retrospect, have proved unsuccessful, or even\n\nunwise, is not the issue\"). The defendant, as a result, must \"overcome\n\nthe presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action\n\n'might be considered sound trial strategy.'\" Id.

In making this statement, the Supreme Court cited with\napproval the Court of Appeals approach to strategic decision-making,\nwhich had in fact allowed challenges when \"the choice was so patently\nunreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it.\"\nWashington v. Strickland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411288\"><a href=\"/opinion/411288/david-leroy-washington-v-charles-e-strickland-superintendent-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">693</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1254 (5th Cir. 1982).\n\n                                    -11-\n\fIII.   Application to Phoenix's Appeal\n\n          Under Strickland, we must ask whether defense counsel's\n\ndecision not to call either defense expert was an act that falls below\n\n\"an objective standard of reasonableness.\" However, if the state court\n\napplied the correct test, we cannot answer this question de novo. See\n\nWilliams, 120 S. Ct. at 1519-20 (holding that application of the\n\nStrickland test is under the unreasonable application prong of §\n\n2254(d)(1)). Although Justice Fried, as single gatekeeper justice of\n\nthe SJC, did not cite Strickland in his analysis, it is clear from his\n\nlanguage that his decision denying Phoenix's motion was based on the\n\njudgment that the failure to call Wraxall was a strategic choice:\n\n          It is this strategy which defendant now claims\n          amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.\n          The defendant claims that if only the expert\n          witness, Dr. Wraxall, had been called to testify,\n          it would have had a damaging effect on the\n          Commonwealth's own expert testimony regarding the\n          crucial blood testimony. But the subject of the\n          reliability of the Commonwealth's testimony on\n          this score had been so thoroughly canvassed both\n          at trial, by cross-examination by defendant's\n          counsel, and then examined by the full court on\n          plenary review, that I think the claim of\n          ineffectiveness of counsel is so far-fetched as\n          to be insubstantial.\n\nPhoenix v. Commonwealth, No. SJ-96-0571, at 4-5 (SJC Memorandum, Fried,\n\nJ., May 8, 1997). The strategy to which Justice Fried referred was\n\ndescribed in the prior decision of the full SJC. See Commonwealth v.\n\nPhoenix, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2083975\"><a href=\"/opinion/2083975/commonwealth-v-phoenix/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 421 n.8 (1991).

The court concluded\n\nthat \"[t]hese considerations were purely ones of trial strategy, and,\n\ntherefore, there is no reason to permit the filing of the affidavit.\"\n\nId.\n\n          As for the fingerprint evidence, Judge Moriarty of the\n\nMassachusetts Superior Court plainly found that the failure to call\n\nMacDonnell was a strategic one. See Commonwealth v. Phoenix, No. 87-\n\n068, at 8 (Superior Court Memorandum, Moriarty, J., March 18, 1996)\n\n(\"[Bennett] made a tactical decision - and probably a wise one.\").\n\n          Hence, we must assess whether the respective state court\n\napplications of Strickland to these ineffective assistance claims was\n\nin fact objectively unreasonable. In other words, were the state court\n\nfindings that Bennett made strategic choices in not calling either\n\nWraxall or MacDonell reasonable determinations? Cf. Tucker v.

Moreover, choices in\n\nemphasis during cross-examination are prototypical examples of\n\nunchallengeable strategy. See Matthews v.

The Fingerprint Evidence\n\n          In response to the prosecution experts' identification of his\n\nclient's prints and exclusion of another suspect's prints, Bennett\n\ncross-examined the Commonwealth's two fingerprint experts both at voir\n\n\n\n3  Although decisions issuing from this Court are not \"clearly\nestablished\" for the purposes of § 2254(d)(1) because they do not issue\nfrom the Supreme Court, they provide significant insight on what\nconstitutes reasonableness for a particular fact pattern. Cf. Clark v.\nStinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768924\"><a href=\"/opinion/768924/paul-clark-v-james-stinson-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327 n.8 (2d Cir. 2000) (citing New York state\nlaw for guidance as to the reasonableness of waiver).\n\n                                 -14-\n\fdire and at trial. Bennett challenged whether the paper bag had been\n\ntreated for prints at the appropriate time and in the appropriate\n\nmanner; he exposed that the expert worked only from photographs, rather\n\nthan from the paper bag itself; and he raised questions about the chain\n\nof custody.    Bennett also spent a significant amount of time\n\nquestioning the methodology of one of the Commonwealth experts\n\n(Shiflett), particularly with regard to discrepancies between the paper\n\nbag print and the comparison print.       In particular, his cross-\n\nexamination prompted Shiflett to testify that the quality of the print\n\nhad limited his observations and that the print on the paper bag was\n\n\"similar to\" but not \"identical\" to the print taken from Phoenix used\n\nfor purposes of comparison.\n\n          Defense expert MacDonnell submitted an affidavit stating\n\nthat, in his opinion, the \"quality of the fingerprint evidence is\n\ninadequate . . . to make a positive ID,\" and as a result he could not\n\n\"conclude with certainty that the unknown [print] is not from Phoenix.\"\n\nMacDonnell could only testify in response to the prosecution's experts\n\nthat identification of the fingerprint was impossible, in his opinion.\n\nHe could not identify the fingerprint as that of another potential\n\nsuspect. He could not say, for certain, that the fingerprint did not\n\nbelong to Phoenix. Although Bennett had not thoroughly discredited the\n\nCommonwealth's fingerprint experts at trial, he had made substantial\n\nprogress in this direction. It is possible that, given his progress\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fduring cross-examination, the limitations of MacDonnell's testimony,\n\nand the threat of exhaustive cross-examination of his own expert,\n\nBennett made a strategic decision not to call him. Judge Moriarty of\n\nthe Massachusetts Superior Court so concluded. We cannot say that such\n\na finding was objectively unreasonable, even if we might have found\n\ndifferently. See Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1522 (distinction between\n\n\"incorrect\" and \"unreasonable\"); see also Tucker, 221 F.3d at 614\n\n(finding that on a close issue, the appellate court can disagree with\n\nthe state court without the state court decision having been\n\nunreasonable); Barnabei, 214 F.3d at 469 (same).\n\n          We also cannot conclude that Bennett's failure to send\n\nMacDonnell additional photographs for review during and after trial\n\nconstituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Although it turned out\n\nthat MacDonnell's opinion of the additional photographs would probably\n\nhave been helpful at trial, Bennett's choice not to pursue further\n\ninvestigation on this front was a reasonable one at trial.\n\nMacDonnell's partially provided expert opinion had lowered Bennett's\n\nexpectations and Bennett had adequately cross-examined the Commonwealth\n\nwitnesses. Even with the stronger evidence, MacDonnell could still not\n\ntestify that the print did not belong to Phoenix. Defense counsel is\n\nallowed to make strategic decisions, within the wide bounds of\n\nprofessional competence, as to which leads to follow up, and on which\n\nareas to focus his energies. This is especially true during trial,\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fwhen time is short. See, e.g., Genius v. Pepe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198038\"><a href=\"/opinion/198038/genius-v-pepe/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).    Given our understanding of Bennett's failure to send\n\nMacDonnell additional photographs as a strategic choice at trial, we\n\ncannot find the state court's decision on this issue an unreasonable\n\napplication of Strickland.\n\n          B.   The Blood Evidence\n\n          The blood evidence presents a more difficult case, simply\n\nbecause the defense expert affidavit promised much more. Wraxall\n\noffered to testify that: (1) the blood on the paper bag was not the\n\nresult of \"blowback\" (i.e., blood splattered from the victim after he\n\nwas shot); (2) the results of the May 11 test were \"scientifically\n\nmeaningless\" and \"not the proper basis for a scientific opinion;\" (3)\n\nprosecution expert Schanfield's methodology was unreliable in important\n\naspects; (4) taken as a whole, the blood evidence was not consistent\n\nwith the victim, and Schanfield's statement to the contrary was\n\nmisleading; and (5) the blood could have been taken from anyone in the\n\npopulation. Wraxall also noted that he would not have been able to\n\nperform independent testing on the samples, because Schanfield had\n\nirreparably altered them and the prosecutors had requested their\n\nreturn.\n\n          At the voir dire, Bennett spent several hours cross-examining\n\nSchanfield and posed significant questions to the reliability of his\n\ntestimony. As a result, the trial judge only allowed Schanfield to\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fmake conclusions based on the May 11 tests. At trial, Bennett engaged\n\nin further cross-examination of Schanfield. Bennett was able to (1)\n\nexpose problems with the control samples; (2) suggest what the problems\n\nwith controls might mean for the reliability of the test as a whole;\n\n(3) prompt Schanfield to testify that he could not say, based on the\n\nMay 11 test, that the blood was that of Green; (4) clarify that the\n\ntest had yielded little in the way of interpretable results; (5)\n\nindicate inconsistencies in the testing of one potentially relevant\n\nblood allotype (the \"N\" allotype); (6) get Schanfield to describe\n\ncertain inconsistencies as \"false positives;\" and (7) get Schanfield to\n\nadmit inconsistencies among tests taken just 30 minutes apart. At the\n\nvery least, even upon reading a cold record, Bennett's cross-\n\nexamination at trial posed significant questions to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of Schanfield's test and his interpretation of the test\n\nresults. The mere fact that Bennett's cross-examination failed to\n\npersuade the jury of Phoenix's innocence is not enough to establish\n\nineffective assistance.\n\n          At best, Wraxall's testimony could have added to Bennett's\n\ncross-examination by further discrediting Schanfield. Wraxall could\n\nhave provided additional evidence challenging Schanfield's scientific\n\nmethods and testing. He could have given the jury a reason to believe\n\nthat the blood was not consistent with Green's. The jury would have\n\nheard that, because the blood was not the result of \"blowback,\" it had\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fnot been deposited on the paper bag in the manner Schanfield suggested.\n\nHowever, Wraxall could not testify that the blood was not Green's; in\n\nfact, he would not testify that the blood belonged to or did not belong\n\nto any specific person. In short, he would support Bennett's cross-\n\nexamination attempt, but not provide any significant new facts or\n\nevidence that might lead the jury to an alternate explanation. As\n\nsuch, we can see that Bennett might have made a strategic decision not\n\nto call him: to call Wraxall would reinforce the lack of an alternative\n\nexplanation, would open his own expert to cross-examination, and might\n\nsimply do no good. See United States v. McGill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195053\"><a href=\"/opinion/195053/united-states-v-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227-28\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (no ineffective assistance claim based on counsel's\n\ndecision not to call witness, after \"skillful cross-examination\" had\n\nelicited much the same opinion evidence that counsel had hoped to\n\nestablish through defense witness). Upon consideration of the record\n\nand Wraxall's affidavit, we cannot find that Justice Fried's\n\nunderstanding of Bennett's action as within the bounds of permissible\n\nstrategic choice is objectively unreasonable. Thus we may not grant a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus on this basis.\n\n          We also cannot conclude that the state court's refusal to\n\ngrant a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel was\n\nunreasonable based on Bennett's so-called \"promise\" to the jury.\n\nPhoenix bases this claim on a sentence of the opening statement in\n\nwhich Bennett noted that \"if anything, tests will show that . . . some\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fof the blood that was on the bag . . . could not have been the blood of\n\nRay Green.\"   It is true that no testimony explicitly showed this\n\n\"promised\" fact.    However, given that (i) Bennett used the \"if\n\nanything\" disclaimer; (ii) Wraxall would not have testified as\n\nsupposedly promised, but only that Schanfield's testing was fatally\n\nflawed; and (iii) Bennett's cross-examination of Schanfield had\n\nattempted, and potentially achieved, the same result, we cannot\n\nconclude that Bennett either made a promise or that any promise he made\n\nwent unfulfilled. Moreover, our cases that premise a habeas writ on an\n\nunfulfilled promise during opening argument generally require greater\n\nspecificity in the promise and greater contemporaneousness between the\n\npromise and jury deliberations. Compare Anderson v. Butler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512374\"><a href=\"/opinion/512374/bruce-anderson-v-norman-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (1st Cir. 1988) (ineffective assistance found upon explicit\n\npromise to call psychiatric witness made a day prior to jury\n\ndeliberations, where voir dire had focused on jury willingness to\n\naccept such testimony), with McGill, 11 F.3d at 227-28 (decision not to\n\ncall previously promised witness who had \"feet of clay\" not ineffective\n\nassistance). The promise here was neither \"dramatic\" nor was the\n\nindicated testimony \"strikingly significant.\" Anderson, 858 F.2d at\n\n17.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          We note that in the pre-Williams world, we would occasionally\n\nremand to the district court for hearings on whether an action was\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fwithin the allowable bounds of strategic choice or not.

The holding of Williams dictates that we do not do so here.\n\nOur only question is whether the state judge's decision that defense\n\ncounsel made a permissible strategic choice was objectively reasonable.\n\nBecause we find that it was, we affirm the district court's denial of\n\nthe writ of habeas corpus.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f</pre>",
