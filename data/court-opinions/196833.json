Additional facts\r                  \r\n\npertinent to the issues in this appeal are discussed below.\r\n\nA.  Offense Conduct\r                               \r\n\n          In the  summer of 1994, the  Maine Drug Enforcement\r\n\nAgency (\"MDEA\")  began investigating a crack  cocaine ring in\r\n\nthe Lewiston/Auburn  area.   The investigation revealed  that\r\n\nthe drug  suppliers, Raul  Baez, Jesus Baez  and Angel  Baez,\r\n\noperated  out  of  Lawrence,  Massachusetts,  and  that  Jose\r\n\nGuzman,  Toni  Lemieux Naftali  (\"Naftali\")  and  Jose Mejia-\r\n\nMartinez   transported  the  drugs   to  Maine  for  ultimate\r\n\ndistribution.    Appellant  Melvin Lagasse  (\"Lagasse\"),  his\r\n\nbrother, Michael Lagasse, and three others, Marlane Driggers,\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nLisa Booth and Thomas Booth, would also on occasion transport\r\n\nthe  crack cocaine (\"crack\") to Maine and sell it in Lewiston\r\n\nand Auburn.\r\n\n          From  July  through early  September  1994, Lagasse\r\n\npurchased  about 100  bags  of crack  per  week from  various\r\n\npersons including  Naftali, Jesus Baez, Guzman,  Driggers and\r\n\nMejia-Martinez.     Lagasse  procured   the  drug   both  for\r\n\ndistribution and for personal  use.  He continued to  use and\r\n\nsell crack until December 7, 1994, when he was arrested while\r\n\nin possession of almost 100 grams of crack.\r\n\n          On  December 20,  1994,  a grand  jury returned  an\r\n\nindictment charging  in Count  I that Lagasse  conspired with\r\n\nthe Baezes, Driggers, Michael  Lagasse, the Booths and others\r\n\nto distribute  and to  possess with  intent to  distribute in\r\n\nexcess of fifty grams of cocaine base (i.e., crack).  Lagasse\r                                                       \r\n\npleaded  guilty to that count  in February 1995; other counts\r\n\nagainst him were dismissed.\r\n\nB.  Sentencing\r                          \r\n\n          The  district court  held a  sentencing  hearing on\r\n\nSeptember 14, 1995,  during which it took evidence  and heard\r\n\nthe testimony of  nine witnesses, including Lagasse.   At the\r\n\nconclusion  of  the hearing,  the  court  made the  following\r\n\nfindings and rulings which  are at issue in this  appeal: (1)\r\n\nthat  an  upward adjustment  for  possession  of a  dangerous\r\n\nweapon  was  applicable because  Lagasse  was  involved in  a\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nknife-point  robbery  of drugs  and  money  from Naftali  and\r\n\nGuzman;  (2) that  an  upward adjustment  for obstruction  of\r\n\njustice was  appropriate because Lagasse  assaulted a witness\r\n\nin retaliation  for, and  to prevent his  further cooperation\r\n\nwith  authorities; and  (3)  that a  downward adjustment  for\r\n\nacceptance of  responsibility was not warranted  both because\r\n\nLagasse obstructed  justice and because he  attempted to have\r\n\ndrugs  smuggled  to  him  in  prison  where he  was  awaiting\r\n\nsentencing.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\nA.  Standard of Review\r                                  \r\n\n          We    review    a   sentencing    court's   factual\r\n\ndeterminations, which must be found by a preponderance of the\r\n\nevidence, for  clear error.   United States  v. McCarthy,  77\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 522, 535 (1st Cir. 1995).   We review questions of  law,\r\n\nincluding  the applicability  of  a sentencing  guideline, de\r                                                                         \r\n\nnovo.  Id.\r                      \r\n\nB.  Enhancement for Possession of a Dangerous Weapon\r                                                                \r\n\n          Lagasse challenges the district court's application\r\n\nof  a dangerous  weapon  enhancement to  his  sentence.   The\r\n\npertinent   sentencing  guideline,   U.S.S.G.    2D1.1(b)(1),\r\n\nprovides for a  two-level increase in the  base offense level\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n\"[i]f   a   dangerous  weapon   (including  a   firearm)  was\r\n\npossessed.\"1  Application note  3 to that guideline provides,\r\n\nin part:\r\n\n          The  enhancement  for  weapon  possession\r\n          reflects the increased danger of violence\r\n          when  drug  traffickers possess  weapons.\r\n          The adjustment should  be applied if  the\r\n          weapon was present,  unless it is clearly\r\n          improbable that the weapon  was connected\r\n          with the offense.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2D1.1, comment. (n.3).\r\n\n          At    the    sentencing    hearing,   Naftali,    a\r\n\ncoconspirator,   testified  that,   throughout  the   day  of\r\n\nSeptember  8, 1994 (a  point within the  indictment period of\r\n\nthe  charged conspiracy),  Lagasse  repeatedly requested  and\r\n\nreceived crack from her.  Naftali stated that she  eventually\r\n\nrebuffed  his  requests  for  more of  the  drug  because  he\r\n\ncontinued to use  rather than sell  it.  Later, in  the early\r\n\nmorning hours  of September 9, Lagasse  returned to Naftali's\r\n\napartment and requested more crack from her and her roommate,\r\n\nGuzman.   Both refused,  and Lagasse  left.   Seconds  later,\r\n\nhowever, Lagasse  forcibly reentered  the apartment with  one\r\n\nMichael Weaver who walked into Guzman's room and held a knife\r\n\nto Guzman's  neck; Lagasse  stood close behind  Weaver during\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Unless otherwise  indicated, all guideline  citations are\r\nto the  November 1994 United  States Sentencing  Commission's\r\nGuidelines Manual.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthis  encounter.   Lagasse and  Weaver then  took all  of the\r\n\ndrugs and cash in the apartment and left.2\r\n\n          Based  on this  event, the  court found  the weapon\r\n\nenhancement appropriate, explaining:\r\n\n               I  observe  first  of  all  that the\r\n          circumstances here are  rather unique  in\r\n          the   application   of  this   adjustment\r\n          because here the possession of the weapon\r\n          was   not  in  furtherance  of  the  drug\r\n          conspiracy in the  sense that Weaver with\r\n          Lagasse's connivance was trying  to steal\r\n          from the conspiracy.\r\n               Nevertheless,  [Application note  3]\r\n          points  out  that  the  reason   for  the\r\n          adjustment  is  the  increased danger  of\r\n          violence  when  drug traffickers  possess\r\n          weapons.  I certainly  attribute Weaver's\r\n          possession   of   the   weapon  to   this\r\n          defendant   because   they   were   there\r\n          jointly.3  And I conclude although  it is\r\n          an  unusual  case that  the circumstances\r\n          here  fit  the definition  of Application\r\n          Note  3  and  call   for  the  two  level\r\n          increase.\r\n\n          We  begin our analysis  with a brief  review of the\r\n\nbasic principles underlying the  application of the dangerous\r\n\nweapon enhancement.   For the enhancement to  be warranted, a\r\n\ncertain  nexus between  the weapon  and the  offense must  be\r\n\nshown.  See  United States v. Pineda, 981 F.2d  569, 573 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1992).   It need not be  shown, however, that the weapon\r\n\nwas used, or  was intended to be used, to perpetrate the drug\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Later that  same day, police arrested  Naftali and Guzman\r\nafter  discovering  large  quantities   of  crack  in   their\r\nautomobile.\r\n\n3.  On  appeal,   Lagasse  does  not   contest  the   court's\r\nattribution of the knife possession to him.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\noffense.  United States v. Castillo, 979 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1992); see also,  United States  v. Ruiz, 905  F.2d 499,  507\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st  Cir.   1990).    Rather,   for  the  purposes   of  the\r\n\nenhancement, we have repeatedly recognized that\r\n\n          \"when  the  weapon's  location  makes  it\r\n          readily available to  protect either  the\r\n          participants   themselves    during   the\r\n          commission of the illegal activity or the\r\n          drugs  and  cash  involved  in  the  drug\r\n          business,   there   will  be   sufficient\r\n          evidence  to connect  the weapons  to the\r\n          offense conduct.\"\r\n\nUnited States v.  Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212,  224 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1994) (quoting  United States  v. Corcimiglia, 967  F.2d 724,\r                                                         \r\n\n727  (1st Cir.  1992)), cert.  denied, 115  S. Ct.  947, 1322\r                                                 \r\n\n(1995).  In other  words, the presence of a  dangerous weapon\r\n\nat some point during  the underlying drug crime may  indicate\r\n\nthe probability of a \"facilitative nexus between the [weapon]\r\n\nand the crime.\"   United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,  34 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n19, 25 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          Once the  presence of a weapon  is established, the\r\n\ndefendant  may  avoid the  enhancement only  by demonstrating\r\n\n\"special  circumstances\"  rendering  it \"clearly  improbable\"\r\n\nthat  the  weapon  was  connected  to  the  drug  trafficking\r\n\noffense.  Ovalle-Marques,  36 F.3d at 224.   An example  of a\r                                    \r\n\n\"special   circumstance\"  is   provided   by  the   guideline\r\n\ncommentary:  \"the  enhancement would  not be  applied if  the\r\n\ndefendant, arrested at his residence, had an unloaded hunting\r\n\nrifle in the closet.\"  U.S.S.G.   2D1.1, comment. (n.3). \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          Here,  the  district court's  factual  findings are\r                                                           \r\n\nunassailable and  Lagasse does not challenge  them on appeal:\r\n\nduring  the indictment  period, Lagasse  was involved  in the\r\n\nrobbing  of a  coconspirator,4 at knife  point, of  drugs and\r\n\nmoney.  What the  parties do dispute is the  district court's\r\n\napplication  of the guidelines to these facts.  While we give\r\n\n\"due deference\" to  the court's exercise  in this regard,  18\r\n\nU.S.C.   3742(e), if its application is contrary  to the law,\r\n\nwe must correct the error.  See United States v. Grandmaison,\r                                                                        \r\n\n77 F.3d 55, 560 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n          The government concedes that  the knife was used to\r\n\nrob fellow  conspirators, but  contends that  the use  of the\r\n\nweapon was intended to \"protect\" Lagasse's access to the very\r\n\ndrugs involved in the conspiracy  and to \"enforce\" his demand\r\n\nfor  more crack  to  sell.   The  government emphasizes  that\r\n\nLagasse  used the knife on  the very premises  from which the\r\n\nconspiracy was carried out and  \"during the active course  of\r\n\nthe conspiracy\"  and concludes that thus, it was not \"clearly\r\n\nimprobable\" that  the knife was connected  with that offense.\r\n\nFinally,  the  government  relies  on  the  expressed  policy\r\n\nconcern behind  the weapon enhancement: the  increased danger\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Although  Guzman and Naftali  were not specifically named\r\nin the indictment as  coconspirators, they were so identified\r\nin  the prosecution's  version of  the events,  which Lagasse\r\naccepted when pleading guilty.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nof violence when drug  traffickers possess weapons.  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2D1.1, comment. (n.3).\r\n\n          Lagasse responds  that the armed  robbery of  drugs\r\n\nand money  from a coconspirator was clearly  unrelated to the\r\n\ncharge to which he pleaded guilty: conspiracy to possess with\r\n\nintent to distribute crack.  He contends that the robbery was\r\n\nadverse  to the  conspiracy's interests,  and thus  the knife\r\n\ncannot  fairly be  \"connected\"  with the  offense within  the\r\n\nmeaning of the guideline.  We agree.\r\n\n          The  government's  observation that  the  knife was\r\n\n\"present\" during  drug trafficking activity, on  the facts of\r\n\nthis case,  misses  the  mark.   It  is  true  that  we  have\r\n\nrecognized that the  \"presence\" of  a weapon at  the site  of\r\n\ndrug  trafficking activity  supports  the  enhancement.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v. Almonte, 952  F.2d 20, 25  (1st Cir. 1991),\r                                     \r\n\ncert. denied, 503 U.S. 1010 (1992).  In addition, however, we\r                        \r\n\nhave invariably  observed that the  weapon's presence implied\r\n\nits purpose to \"protect\" some aspect of the drug operation --\r\n\ne.g., the drugs  or the  participants -- even  if it was  not\r                \r\n\nactually  used to perpetrate  the crime.   See, e.g., Ovalle-\r                                                                         \r\n\nMarquez, 36 F.3d at  224; Pineda, 981 F.2d at  574; Castillo,\r                                                                        \r\n\n979 F.2d at 11; United States v. Preakos, 907 F.2d  7, 9 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\nCir.  1990);  Ruiz,  905 F.2d  at  508.    Thus, our  caselaw\r                              \r\n\nestablishes only that a weapon's presence during the criminal\r\n\nactivity  will trigger the enhancement when the circumstances\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\npermit  an  inference that  the weapon  served to  protect or\r\n\notherwise facilitate the offense conduct.\r\n\n          Here, in  contrast, the  weapon played a  role that\r\n\nwas  entirely  adverse  to  the  \"interests\"  of  the  crime.\r\n\nLagasse's  offense, to  which the  enhancement  attached, was\r\n\ncriminal conspiracy -- an agreement with others to  engage in\r\n\nunlawful  conduct.    As  the district  court  observed,  the\r\n\nrobbery was \"not in furtherance of the  drug conspiracy\" but,\r\n\nin   effect,  a   theft  from   the  conspiracy  --   an  act\r\n\nquintessentially  antithetical to  the  offense.5   The facts\r\n\nfound by the district court indisputably negate the inference\r\n\nthat normally  arises from  the presence  of a  weapon during\r\n\ndrug trafficking  activity.  Had Lagasse been  convicted of a\r\n\ndrug  possession or  distribution crime  with respect  to the\r\n\ndrugs stolen from Guzman, the case might have been different;\r\n\nbut that is not what happened here.6\r\n\n          Thus,  we hold that the  facts of this  case do not\r\n\ncome  within  the  seemingly  broad  purview  of  the  weapon\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  There  is no evidence in the record that Lagasse sold any\r\nof   the  drugs  taken  from  Guzman  (although  there  is  a\r\nsuggestion  that he  shared some  of them  with  his brother,\r\nMichael Lagasse).\r\n\n6.  The government incorrectly  cites, as applicable  here, a\r\nprevious version of   2D1.1(b), which contained the following\r\nunderscored language:   \"If  a dangerous weapon  (including a\r\nfirearm) was  possessed  during commission  of  the  offense,\r                                                                        \r\nincrease by 2 levels.\"   See Amendment 394, U.S.S.G.  App. C.\r                                        \r\nThe Sentencing Commission deleted that language by amendment,\r\neffective November 1, 1991.  Id.\r                                            \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nenhancement.     See   U.S.S.G.     2D1.1,   comment.   (n.3)\r                                \r\n\n(indicating that  the enhancement  applies if the  weapon was\r\n\nsomehow  \"connected\" with  the  offense).   Moreover, we  are\r\n\nunpersuaded by the  government's reliance on  the guideline's\r\n\nunderlying  concern about  the increased  danger  of violence\r\n\nwhen drug traffickers possess weapons.  The guideline  is not\r\n\nintended  to cover every instance  in which a drug trafficker\r\n\npossesses a weapon.  Rather, the enhancement applies when the\r\n\nweapon  possession has  the requisite  nexus to  the relevant\r\n\noffense.  Because the  court erred in its  interpretation and\r                   \r\n\napplication of the weapon enhancement, that part of Lagasse's\r\n\nsentence must be vacated.\r\n\nC.  Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice\r                                                      \r\n\n          Lagasse also claims that the court erred in finding\r\n\nthat  he obstructed  justice  and in  adjusting his  sentence\r\n\naccordingly.  Sentencing Guideline   3C1.1 provides:  \"If the\r\n\ndefendant willfully  obstructed or impeded,  or attempted  to\r\n\nobstruct or impede, the  administration of justice during the\r\n\ninvestigation,  prosecution, or  sentencing  of  the  instant\r\n\noffense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.\"\r\n\n          At the sentencing hearing, an agent with the United\r\n\nStates Immigration and Naturalization Service testified that,\r\n\non December  22, 1994,  he heard  a general  discussion among\r\n\nLagasse and his codefendants (who, at the time, were awaiting\r\n\narraignment in a  lockup area) relating their belief that two\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nindividuals named Scott and  Patty Poulin were \"the  rats\" in\r\n\nthe operation and that their cooperation with authorities was\r\n\nthe  cause  of the  arrests.   A  corrections officer  at the\r\n\nKennebec County jail  testified that, on  the morning of  May\r\n\n22, 1995 -- a time after which Lagasse had pleaded guilty but\r\n\nbefore his  sentencing -- Lagasse approached  Scott Poulin in\r\n\nthe jail  recreation  yard  and punched  him.    The  officer\r\n\nfurther testified  that Poulin  was groggy and  bleeding from\r\n\nthe mouth and nose, and was sent to the prison infirmary.  An\r\n\nagent  with the MDEA testified  that, in July  1995, he asked\r\n\nPoulin  about the assault,  and Poulin told  him that Lagasse\r\n\n\"sucker punched\" him and  stated, \"I know you're a  rat, this\r\n\nis for being a rat.  You better . . . stop talking.\"7\r\n\n          From this  evidence, the district court  found that\r\n\nLagasse struck  Poulin because of Poulin's  cooperation \"at a\r\n\ntime when  these matters  were still  pending\" and thus,  the\r\n\nobstruction of justice enhancement was warranted.  On appeal,\r\n\nLagasse  contends   that  the  obstruction   enhancement  was\r\n\nimproper  because,  while  he   may  have  struck  Poulin  in\r\n\nretaliation for being a  \"rat,\" there could not have  been an\r\n\nobstruction of justice because he had already pleaded guilty.\r\n\nTo this end, he asserts that Poulin had nothing to contribute\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  In contrast, Lagasse testified  that he never hit Poulin.\r\nHe  further stated  that  he did  not  know that  Poulin  was\r\ncooperating  with the  authorities, and  pointed out  that he\r\n(Lagasse) was the  one who testified against Poulin  before a\r\ngrand jury.  Lagasse does not press this position on appeal.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nto the sentencing determination  and, in fact, was in  no way\r\n\ninvolved with  that disposition.   Lagasse is  wrong for  two\r\n\nreasons.\r\n\n          First,  the district  court supportably  found that\r\n\nLagasse  knew of  Poulin's cooperation  and assaulted  him to\r\n\nprevent  further  similar  conduct.    Although  Lagasse  had\r\n\nalready pleaded guilty to the offense, he struck Poulin after\r\n\nthe  preparation of his PSR but before his sentencing.  While\r\n\nPoulin was not specifically mentioned in the PSR, he had been\r\n\nseparately  indicted as  a  coconspirator of  Raul and  Jesus\r\n\nBaez,   two  of  Lagasse's  codefendants.    Because  Lagasse\r\n\nbelieved  that  Poulin was  the  \"rat\"  in the  operation,  a\r\n\nreasonable  inference  from  the  evidence  is  that  Lagasse\r\n\nthought that  Poulin could provide information,  such as drug\r\n\nquantity, that would affect  his sentence.  In light  of this\r\n\nevidence, especially Lagasse's warning to \"stop  talking,\" we\r\n\ncannot say  that  the court  clearly  erred in  finding  that\r\n\nLagasse's  assault  on Poulin  was  intended  to prevent  any\r\n\nfurther cooperation in the  proceedings against Lagasse.  The\r\n\nfact that Poulin did not, or even could not have, contributed\r\n\nanything to the sentencing  process is irrelevant because the\r\n\nenhancement applies to attempted,  as well as actual, witness\r\n\nintimidation.   See U.S.S.G.    3C1.1, comment. (n.3(a)); see\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Cotts, 14  F.3d 300,  307 (7th  Cir. 1994)\r                                    \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n(finding enhancement proper  where the  defendant plotted  to\r\n\nkill a fictional informant).\r\n\n          Second,  even  if  the  evidence  only  supported a\r\n\nfinding that  the assault was intended to  retaliate for past\r\n\ncooperation (and not to prevent future acts), the obstruction\r\n\nof  justice enhancement  would be  appropriate.   Application\r\n\nnote  3(i)  to  the  obstruction guideline  states  that  the\r\n\nenhancement  applies  for \"conduct  prohibited  by  18 U.S.C.\r\n\n   1501-1516.\"   U.S.S.G.    3C1.1, comment.  (n.3(i)).    In\r\n\nturn, 18 U.S.C.   1513(b)  prohibits the infliction of bodily\r\n\ninjury  with the  intent to  retaliate  for the  providing of\r\n\ninformation relating to  a federal offense.   Here, there was\r\n\nample evidence that Lagasse injured Poulin in retaliation for\r\n\nhis past cooperation.  This conduct falls squarely within the\r\n\nobstruction  of justice guideline.  See Cotts, 14 F.3d at 308\r                                                         \r\n\n(holding that  the guideline's reference to    1513 allows an\r\n\nobstruction  enhancement even  where the  motive was  only to\r\n\n\"punish a snitch\").\r\n\n          We  find no  error  in the  court's enhancement  of\r\n\nLagasse's sentence for obstruction of justice.\r\n\nD.   Denial  of Adjustment  for Acceptance  of Responsibility\r                                                                         \r\n\n          Lagasse contends that he was entitled to a downward\r\n\nadjustment  for  acceptance  of  responsibility   because  he\r\n\npleaded  guilty  within months  of  his  arrest and  appeared\r\n\nbefore a grand jury on the government's behalf.  Although the\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\ncourt refused to grant the adjustment,  it did expressly take\r\n\ninto  account Lagasse's guilty plea when fixing a sentence in\r\n\nthe  middle of  the applicable  guideline range,  despite the\r\n\ngovernment's  recommendation  for  the  maximum  imprisonment\r\n\nterm.\r\n\n          A  two-level  reduction  in the  offense  level  is\r\n\nwarranted \"[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance\r\n\nof  responsibility  for  his  offense.\"    U.S.S.G.    3E1.1.\r\n\nHowever,  \"[a] defendant  who  enters a  guilty  plea is  not\r\n\nentitled to an adjustment [for acceptance of  responsibility]\r\n\nas a matter  of right.\"  Id. comment.

Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\ncomment. (n.4).  Other than referring to his challenge to the\r\n\nobstruction of justice enhancement, Lagasse does not indicate\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nhow his case  might be  \"extraordinary\" enough  to allow  the\r\n\nacceptance  of responsibility adjustment.   Because Lagasse's\r\n\ncase is \"ordinary\" in that the obstructive conduct \"indicates\r\n\nthat the  defendant has  not accepted responsibility  for his\r\n\ncriminal  conduct,\" id.,  the  denial of  the adjustment  was\r                                   \r\n\nproper.   See United States v. Wheelwright, 918 F.2d 226, 229\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).\r\n\n          The district court alternatively found that Lagasse\r\n\ndid  not deserve the  acceptance of responsibility adjustment\r\n\nbecause he was involved  in an attempt to smuggle  drugs into\r\n\nprison.  At  the sentencing hearing, an MDEA  agent testified\r\n\nthat on March  25, 1995,  he went to  the Maine  Correctional\r\n\nCenter  to  investigate  an   anonymous  tip  that  Lagasse's\r\n\ngirlfriend, Grace  Sheloske, would  attempt to  smuggle drugs\r\n\ninto  the  prison that  day.   When  Sheloske arrived  at the\r\n\nprison,  she told  the  agent that  she  was there  to  visit\r\n\nLagasse  and eventually  admitted that  she was  concealing a\r\n\nsmall  amount of crack.  Sheloske refused to identify to whom\r\n\nshe intended to give the drugs, stating that she did not want\r\n\nto  \"get him  in trouble.\"   A  deputy United  States Marshal\r\n\ntestified  that,  just  before  the  sentencing  hearing,  he\r\n\ninterviewed Jeffrey Rumore  -- an inmate  who worked for  the\r\n\nprison laundry -- who  told him that Lagasse had  confided to\r\n\nRumore that Sheloske planned to smuggle crack into the prison\r\n\nand pass it during contact visits in the visiting room.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          Based on  this testimony,  the court found  that it\r\n\nwas  Rumore who tipped  off the authorities  of the smuggling\r\n\nplan,  that Lagasse must have told Rumore about the plan, and\r\n\nthus Lagasse knew in advance that Sheloske was carrying drugs\r\n\nfor  him  and indeed,  that she  did so  at  his behest.   On\r\n\nappeal, Lagasse argues that the court should not hold against\r\n\nhim \"the one  single occasion where  an admitted drug  addict\r\n\ntried to feed his habit,\"  combined with the Poulin  assault,\r\n\nto  deny him any credit for acceptance of responsibility.

See United States v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1158 (1st Cir.1996).   Additional facts pertinent to the issues in this appeal are discussed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Offense Conduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1994, the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (\"MDEA\") began investigating a crack cocaine ring in the Lewiston/Auburn area.   The investigation revealed that the drug suppliers, Raul Baez, Jesus Baez and Angel Baez, operated out of Lawrence, Massachusetts, and that Jose Guzman, Toni Lemieux Naftali (\"Naftali\") and Jose Mejia-Martinez transported the drugs to Maine for ultimate distribution.   Appellant Melvin Lagasse (\"Lagasse\"), his brother, Michael Lagasse, and three others, Marlane Driggers, Lisa Booth and Thomas Booth, would also on occasion transport the crack cocaine (\"crack\") to Maine and sell it in Lewiston and Auburn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From July through early September 1994, Lagasse purchased about 100 bags of crack per week from various persons including Naftali, Jesus Baez, Guzman, Driggers and Mejia-Martinez.   Lagasse procured the drug both for distribution and for personal use.   He continued to use and sell crack until December 7, 1994, when he was arrested while in possession of almost 100 grams of crack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 20, 1994, a grand jury returned an indictment charging in Count I that Lagasse conspired with the Baezes, Driggers, Michael Lagasse, the Booths and others to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute in excess of fifty grams of cocaine base (i.e., crack).   Lagasse pleaded guilty to that count in February 1995;  other counts against him were dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a sentencing hearing on September 14, 1995, during which it took evidence and heard the testimony of nine witnesses, including Lagasse.   At the conclusion of the hearing, the court made the following findings and rulings which are at issue in this appeal:  (1) that an upward adjustment for possession of a dangerous weapon was applicable because Lagasse was involved in a knife-point robbery of drugs and money from Naftali and Guzman;  (2) that an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice was appropriate because Lagasse assaulted a witness in retaliation for, and to prevent his further cooperation with authorities;  and (3) that a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was not warranted both because Lagasse obstructed justice and because he attempted to have drugs smuggled to him in prison where he was awaiting sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p>A.

Enhancement for Possession of a Dangerous Weapon</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lagasse challenges the district court's application of a dangerous weapon enhancement to his sentence.   The pertinent sentencing guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), provides for a two-level increase in the base offense level \"[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Application note 3 to that guideline provides, in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The enhancement for weapon possession reflects the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons.   The adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, comment.  (n.3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, Naftali, a coconspirator, testified that, throughout the day of September 8, 1994 (a point within the indictment period of the charged conspiracy), Lagasse repeatedly requested and received crack from her.   Naftali stated that she eventually rebuffed his requests for more of the drug because he continued to use rather than sell it.   Later, in the early morning hours of September 9, Lagasse returned to Naftali's apartment and requested more crack from her and her roommate, Guzman.   Both refused, and Lagasse left.   Seconds later, however, Lagasse forcibly reentered the apartment with one Michael Weaver who walked into Guzman's room and held a knife to Guzman's neck;  Lagasse stood close behind Weaver during this encounter.   Lagasse and Weaver then took all of the drugs and cash in the apartment and left.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this event, the court found the weapon enhancement appropriate, explaining:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I observe first of all that the circumstances here are rather unique in the application of this adjustment because here the possession of the weapon was not in furtherance of the drug conspiracy in the sense that Weaver with Lagasse's connivance was trying to steal from the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, [Application note 3] points out that the reason for the adjustment is the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons.   I certainly attribute Weaver's possession of the weapon to this defendant because they were there jointly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  And I conclude although it is an unusual case that the circumstances here fit the definition of Application Note 3 and call for the two level increase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with a brief review of the basic principles underlying the application of the dangerous weapon enhancement.   For the enhancement to be warranted, a certain nexus between the weapon and the offense must be shown.   See United States v. Pineda, 981 F.2d 569, 573 (1st Cir.1992).   It need not be shown, however, that the weapon was used, or was intended to be used, to perpetrate the drug offense.  United States v. Castillo, 979 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir.1992);  see also, United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 507 (1st Cir.1990).   Rather, for the purposes of the enhancement, we have repeatedly recognized that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>\"when the weapon's location makes it readily available to protect either the participants themselves during the commission of the illegal activity or the drugs and cash involved in the drug business, there will be sufficient evidence to connect the weapons to the offense conduct.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 224 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting United States v. Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d 724, 727 (1st Cir.1992)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 891, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1322, 131 L.Ed.2d 202 (1995).   In other words, the presence of a dangerous weapon at some point during the underlying drug crime may indicate the probability of a \"facilitative nexus between the [weapon] and the crime.\"  United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the presence of a weapon is established, the defendant may avoid the enhancement only by demonstrating \"special circumstances\" rendering it \"clearly improbable\" that the weapon was connected to the drug trafficking offense.  Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d at 224.   An example of a \"special circumstance\" is provided by the guideline commentary:  \"the enhancement would not be applied if the defendant, arrested at his residence, had an unloaded hunting rifle in the closet.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, comment.  (n.3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court's factual findings are unassailable and Lagasse does not challenge them on appeal:  during the indictment period, Lagasse was involved in the robbing of a coconspirator,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> at knife point, of drugs and money.   What the parties do dispute is the district court's application of the guidelines to these facts.   While we give \"due deference\" to the court's exercise in this regard, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e), if its application is contrary to the law, we must correct the error.   See United States v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 560 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government concedes that the knife was used to rob fellow conspirators, but contends that the use of the weapon was intended to \"protect\" Lagasse's access to the very drugs involved in the conspiracy and to \"enforce\" his demand for more crack to sell.   The government emphasizes that Lagasse used the knife on the very premises from which the conspiracy was carried out and \"during the active course of the conspiracy\" and concludes that thus, it was not \"clearly improbable\" that the knife was connected with that offense.   Finally, the government relies on the expressed policy concern behind the weapon enhancement:  the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, comment.  (n.3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lagasse responds that the armed robbery of drugs and money from a coconspirator was clearly unrelated to the charge to which he pleaded guilty:  conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack.   He contends that the robbery was adverse to the conspiracy's interests, and thus the knife cannot fairly be \"connected\" with the offense within the meaning of the guideline.   We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's observation that the knife was \"present\" during drug trafficking activity, on the facts of this case, misses the mark.   It is true that we have recognized that the \"presence\" of a weapon at the site of drug trafficking activity supports the enhancement.   See United States v. Almonte, 952 F.2d 20, 25 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 1010, 112 S.Ct. 1776, 118 L.Ed.2d 434 (1992).   In addition, however, we have invariably observed that the weapon's presence implied its purpose to \"protect\" some aspect of the drug operation--e.g., the drugs or the participants--even if it was not actually used to perpetrate the crime.   See, e.g., Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d at 224;  Pineda, 981 F.2d at 574;  Castillo, 979 F.2d at 11;  United States v. Preakos, 907 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1990);  Ruiz, 905 F.2d at 508.   Thus, our caselaw establishes only that a weapon's presence during the criminal activity will trigger the enhancement when the circumstances permit an inference that the weapon served to protect or otherwise facilitate the offense conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in contrast, the weapon played a role that was entirely adverse to the \"interests\" of the crime.   Lagasse's offense, to which the enhancement attached, was criminal conspiracy--an agreement with others to engage in unlawful conduct.   As the district court observed, the robbery was \"not in furtherance of the drug conspiracy\" but, in effect, a theft from the conspiracy--an act quintessentially antithetical to the offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The facts found by the district court indisputably negate the inference that normally arises from the presence of a weapon during drug trafficking activity.   Had Lagasse been convicted of a drug possession or distribution crime with respect to the drugs stolen from Guzman, the case might have been different;  but that is not what happened here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we hold that the facts of this case do not come within the seemingly broad purview of the weapon enhancement.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, comment.  (n.3) (indicating that the enhancement applies if the weapon was somehow \"connected\" with the offense).   Moreover, we are unpersuaded by the government's reliance on the guideline's underlying concern about the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons.   The guideline is not intended to cover every instance in which a drug trafficker possesses a weapon.   Rather, the enhancement applies when the weapon possession has the requisite nexus to the relevant offense.   Because the court erred in its interpretation and application of the weapon enhancement, that part of Lagasse's sentence must be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lagasse also claims that the court erred in finding that he obstructed justice and in adjusting his sentence accordingly.   Sentencing Guideline &#167; 3C1.1 provides:  \"If the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, an agent with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service testified that, on December 22, 1994, he heard a general discussion among Lagasse and his codefendants (who, at the time, were awaiting arraignment in a lockup area) relating their belief that two individuals named Scott and Patty Poulin were \"the rats\" in the operation and that their cooperation with authorities was the cause of the arrests.   A corrections officer at the Kennebec County jail testified that, on the morning of May 22, 1995--a time after which Lagasse had pleaded guilty but before his sentencing--Lagasse approached Scott Poulin in the jail recreation yard and punched him.   The officer further testified that Poulin was groggy and bleeding from the mouth and nose, and was sent to the prison infirmary.   An agent with the MDEA testified that, in July 1995, he asked Poulin about the assault, and Poulin told him that Lagasse \"sucker punched\" him and stated, \"I know you're a rat, this is for being a rat. You better ... stop talking.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this evidence, the district court found that Lagasse struck Poulin because of Poulin's cooperation \"at a time when these matters were still pending\" and thus, the obstruction of justice enhancement was warranted.   On appeal, Lagasse contends that the obstruction enhancement was improper because, while he may have struck Poulin in retaliation for being a \"rat,\" there could not have been an obstruction of justice because he had already pleaded guilty.   To this end, he asserts that Poulin had nothing to contribute to the sentencing determination and, in fact, was in no way involved with that disposition.   Lagasse is wrong for two reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court supportably found that Lagasse knew of Poulin's cooperation and assaulted him to prevent further similar conduct.   Although Lagasse had already pleaded guilty to the offense, he struck Poulin after the preparation of his PSR but before his sentencing.   While Poulin was not specifically mentioned in the PSR, he had been separately indicted as a coconspirator of Raul and Jesus Baez, two of Lagasse's codefendants.   Because Lagasse believed that Poulin was the \"rat\" in the operation, a reasonable inference from the evidence is that Lagasse thought that Poulin could provide information, such as drug quantity, that would affect his sentence.   In light of this evidence, especially Lagasse's warning to \"stop talking,\" we cannot say that the court clearly erred in finding that Lagasse's assault on Poulin was intended to prevent any further cooperation in the proceedings against Lagasse.   The fact that Poulin did not, or even could not have, contributed anything to the sentencing process is irrelevant because the enhancement applies to attempted, as well as actual, witness intimidation.

Application note 3(i) to the obstruction guideline states that the enhancement applies for \"conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1501-1516.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n.3(i)).   In turn, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1513(b) prohibits the infliction of bodily injury with the intent to retaliate for the providing of information relating to a federal offense.   Here, there was ample evidence that Lagasse injured Poulin in retaliation for his past cooperation.   This conduct falls squarely within the obstruction of justice guideline.   See Cotts, 14 F.3d at 308 (holding that the guideline's reference to &#167; 1513 allows an obstruction enhancement even where the motive was only to \"punish a snitch\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error in the court's enhancement of Lagasse's sentence for obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>D.

Although the court refused to grant the adjustment, it did expressly take into account Lagasse's guilty plea when fixing a sentence in the middle of the applicable guideline range, despite the government's recommendation for the maximum imprisonment term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A two-level reduction in the offense level is warranted \"[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1.  However, \"[a] defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment [for acceptance of responsibility] as a matter of right.\"   Id. comment.  (n.3);  see also United States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 29-30 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that \"a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is not automatically to be conferred upon every accused who pleads guilty\").   While pleading guilty before trial and truthfully admitting the offense conduct will constitute \"significant evidence\" of acceptance of responsibility, \"this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.

Id. comment.  (n.4).   Other than referring to his challenge to the obstruction of justice enhancement, Lagasse does not indicate how his case might be \"extraordinary\" enough to allow the acceptance of responsibility adjustment.   Because Lagasse's case is \"ordinary\" in that the obstructive conduct \"indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct,\" id., the denial of the adjustment was proper.   See United States v. Wheelwright, 918 F.2d 226, 229 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court alternatively found that Lagasse did not deserve the acceptance of responsibility adjustment because he was involved in an attempt to smuggle drugs into prison.   At the sentencing hearing, an MDEA agent testified that on March 25, 1995, he went to the Maine Correctional Center to investigate an anonymous tip that Lagasse's girlfriend, Grace Sheloske, would attempt to smuggle drugs into the prison that day.   When Sheloske arrived at the prison, she told the agent that she was there to visit Lagasse and eventually admitted that she was concealing a small amount of crack.   Sheloske refused to identify to whom she intended to give the drugs, stating that she did not want to \"get him in trouble.\"   A deputy United States Marshal testified that, just before the sentencing hearing, he interviewed Jeffrey Rumore--an inmate who worked for the prison laundry--who told him that Lagasse had confided to Rumore that Sheloske planned to smuggle crack into the prison and pass it during contact visits in the visiting room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this testimony, the court found that it was Rumore who tipped off the authorities of the smuggling plan, that Lagasse must have told Rumore about the plan, and thus Lagasse knew in advance that Sheloske was carrying drugs for him and indeed, that she did so at his behest.   On appeal, Lagasse argues that the court should not hold against him \"the one single occasion where an admitted drug addict tried to feed his habit,\" combined with the Poulin assault, to deny him any credit for acceptance of responsibility.   We must disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[I]t is primarily up to the district court to decide whether or not the appellant accepted responsibility for his conduct 'with candor and authentic remorse.' \"  Wheelwright, 918 F.2d at 229 (quoting Royer, 895 F.2d at 30).   We have held that, while a court may not require a defendant to accept responsibility for conduct beyond the offense of conviction, it may consider a defendant's post-offense conduct--including illegal drug activity--as evidence of the sincerity of his claimed remorse for the convicted offense.  United States v. O'Neil, 936 F.2d 599, 599-601 (1st Cir.1991) (upholding sentencing court's consideration of post-offense use of marijuana in determining applicability of adjustment for mail theft offense);  accord United States v. Byrd, 76 F.3d 194, 196-97 (8th Cir.1996) (listing cases).   While such conduct does not compel the denial of credit for acceptance of responsibility, O'Neil, 936 F.2d at 600, the court could reasonably conclude here that Lagasse's involvement in the attempted smuggling of drugs into the prison was inconsistent with his claimed remorse, thus negating the applicability of the adjustment.   See United States v. Olvera, 954 F.2d 788, 793 (2d Cir.)  (sentencing court permissibly found that the smuggling of marijuana into prison \"was inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility\"), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1211, 112 S.Ct. 3011, 120 L.Ed.2d 885 (1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find no error in the court's refusal to grant Lagasse the benefit of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice and its denial of credit for acceptance of responsibility.

Offense Conduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1994, the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (\"MDEA\") began investigating a crack cocaine ring in the Lewiston/Auburn area.   The investigation revealed that the drug suppliers, Raul Baez, Jesus Baez and Angel Baez, operated out of Lawrence, Massachusetts, and that Jose Guzman, Toni Lemieux Naftali (\"Naftali\") and Jose Mejia-Martinez transported the drugs to Maine for ultimate distribution.   Appellant Melvin Lagasse (\"Lagasse\"), his brother, Michael Lagasse, and three others, Marlane Driggers, Lisa Booth and Thomas Booth, would also on occasion transport the crack cocaine (\"crack\") to Maine and sell it in Lewiston and Auburn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From July through early September 1994, Lagasse purchased about 100 bags of crack per week from various persons including Naftali, Jesus Baez, Guzman, Driggers and Mejia-Martinez.   Lagasse procured the drug both for distribution and for personal use.   He continued to use and sell crack until December 7, 1994, when he was arrested while in possession of almost 100 grams of crack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 20, 1994, a grand jury returned an indictment charging in Count I that Lagasse conspired with the Baezes, Driggers, Michael Lagasse, the Booths and others to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute in excess of fifty grams of cocaine base (i.e., crack).   Lagasse pleaded guilty to that count in February 1995;  other counts against him were dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

At the conclusion of the hearing, the court made the following findings and rulings which are at issue in this appeal:  (1) that an upward adjustment for possession of a dangerous weapon was applicable because Lagasse was involved in a knife-point robbery of drugs and money from Naftali and Guzman;  (2) that an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice was appropriate because Lagasse assaulted a witness in retaliation for, and to prevent his further cooperation with authorities;  and (3) that a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was not warranted both because Lagasse obstructed justice and because he attempted to have drugs smuggled to him in prison where he was awaiting sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p>A.

The pertinent sentencing guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), provides for a two-level increase in the base offense level \"[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Application note 3 to that guideline provides, in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The enhancement for weapon possession reflects the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons.

Naftali stated that she eventually rebuffed his requests for more of the drug because he continued to use rather than sell it.   Later, in the early morning hours of September 9, Lagasse returned to Naftali's apartment and requested more crack from her and her roommate, Guzman.   Both refused, and Lagasse left.   Seconds later, however, Lagasse forcibly reentered the apartment with one Michael Weaver who walked into Guzman's room and held a knife to Guzman's neck;  Lagasse stood close behind Weaver during this encounter.   Lagasse and Weaver then took all of the drugs and cash in the apartment and left.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this event, the court found the weapon enhancement appropriate, explaining:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I observe first of all that the circumstances here are rather unique in the application of this adjustment because here the possession of the weapon was not in furtherance of the drug conspiracy in the sense that Weaver with Lagasse's connivance was trying to steal from the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, [Application note 3] points out that the reason for the adjustment is the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons.   I certainly attribute Weaver's possession of the weapon to this defendant because they were there jointly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  And I conclude although it is an unusual case that the circumstances here fit the definition of Application Note 3 and call for the two level increase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with a brief review of the basic principles underlying the application of the dangerous weapon enhancement.

Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d at 224.   An example of a \"special circumstance\" is provided by the guideline commentary:  \"the enhancement would not be applied if the defendant, arrested at his residence, had an unloaded hunting rifle in the closet.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, comment.

What the parties do dispute is the district court's application of the guidelines to these facts.   While we give \"due deference\" to the court's exercise in this regard, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e), if its application is contrary to the law, we must correct the error.   See United States v.

The government emphasizes that Lagasse used the knife on the very premises from which the conspiracy was carried out and \"during the active course of the conspiracy\" and concludes that thus, it was not \"clearly improbable\" that the knife was connected with that offense.   Finally, the government relies on the expressed policy concern behind the weapon enhancement:  the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons.

(n.3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lagasse responds that the armed robbery of drugs and money from a coconspirator was clearly unrelated to the charge to which he pleaded guilty:  conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack.   He contends that the robbery was adverse to the conspiracy's interests, and thus the knife cannot fairly be \"connected\" with the offense within the meaning of the guideline.   We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's observation that the knife was \"present\" during drug trafficking activity, on the facts of this case, misses the mark.   It is true that we have recognized that the \"presence\" of a weapon at the site of drug trafficking activity supports the enhancement.   See United States v. Almonte, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574333\"><a href=\"/opinion/574333/united-states-v-maria-almonte-united-states-of-america-v-artemia-feliz/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1776</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></span> (1992).   In addition, however, we have invariably observed that the weapon's presence implied its purpose to \"protect\" some aspect of the drug operation--e.g., the drugs or the participants--even if it was not actually used to perpetrate the crime.   See, e.g., Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d at 224;  Pineda, 981 F.2d at 574;  Castillo, 979 F.2d at 11;  United States v. Preakos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543832\"><a href=\"/opinion/543832/united-states-v-darrell-walter-preakos/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1990);  Ruiz, 905 F.2d at 508.   Thus, our caselaw establishes only that a weapon's presence during the criminal activity will trigger the enhancement when the circumstances permit an inference that the weapon served to protect or otherwise facilitate the offense conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in contrast, the weapon played a role that was entirely adverse to the \"interests\" of the crime.   Lagasse's offense, to which the enhancement attached, was criminal conspiracy--an agreement with others to engage in unlawful conduct.   As the district court observed, the robbery was \"not in furtherance of the drug conspiracy\" but, in effect, a theft from the conspiracy--an act quintessentially antithetical to the offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The facts found by the district court indisputably negate the inference that normally arises from the presence of a weapon during drug trafficking activity.   Had Lagasse been convicted of a drug possession or distribution crime with respect to the drugs stolen from Guzman, the case might have been different;  but that is not what happened here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we hold that the facts of this case do not come within the seemingly broad purview of the weapon enhancement.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, comment.  (n.3) (indicating that the enhancement applies if the weapon was somehow \"connected\" with the offense).   Moreover, we are unpersuaded by the government's reliance on the guideline's underlying concern about the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons.   The guideline is not intended to cover every instance in which a drug trafficker possesses a weapon.   Rather, the enhancement applies when the weapon possession has the requisite nexus to the relevant offense.   Because the court erred in its interpretation and application of the weapon enhancement, that part of Lagasse's sentence must be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lagasse also claims that the court erred in finding that he obstructed justice and in adjusting his sentence accordingly.   Sentencing Guideline &#167; 3C1.1 provides:  \"If the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, an agent with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service testified that, on December 22, 1994, he heard a general discussion among Lagasse and his codefendants (who, at the time, were awaiting arraignment in a lockup area) relating their belief that two individuals named Scott and Patty Poulin were \"the rats\" in the operation and that their cooperation with authorities was the cause of the arrests.   A corrections officer at the Kennebec County jail testified that, on the morning of May 22, 1995--a time after which Lagasse had pleaded guilty but before his sentencing--Lagasse approached Scott Poulin in the jail recreation yard and punched him.   The officer further testified that Poulin was groggy and bleeding from the mouth and nose, and was sent to the prison infirmary.   An agent with the MDEA testified that, in July 1995, he asked Poulin about the assault, and Poulin told him that Lagasse \"sucker punched\" him and stated, \"I know you're a rat, this is for being a rat. You better ... stop talking.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this evidence, the district court found that Lagasse struck Poulin because of Poulin's cooperation \"at a time when these matters were still pending\" and thus, the obstruction of justice enhancement was warranted.   On appeal, Lagasse contends that the obstruction enhancement was improper because, while he may have struck Poulin in retaliation for being a \"rat,\" there could not have been an obstruction of justice because he had already pleaded guilty.   To this end, he asserts that Poulin had nothing to contribute to the sentencing determination and, in fact, was in no way involved with that disposition.   Lagasse is wrong for two reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court supportably found that Lagasse knew of Poulin's cooperation and assaulted him to prevent further similar conduct.   Although Lagasse had already pleaded guilty to the offense, he struck Poulin after the preparation of his PSR but before his sentencing.   While Poulin was not specifically mentioned in the PSR, he had been separately indicted as a coconspirator of Raul and Jesus Baez, two of Lagasse's codefendants.   Because Lagasse believed that Poulin was the \"rat\" in the operation, a reasonable inference from the evidence is that Lagasse thought that Poulin could provide information, such as drug quantity, that would affect his sentence.   In light of this evidence, especially Lagasse's warning to \"stop talking,\" we cannot say that the court clearly erred in finding that Lagasse's assault on Poulin was intended to prevent any further cooperation in the proceedings against Lagasse.   The fact that Poulin did not, or even could not have, contributed anything to the sentencing process is irrelevant because the enhancement applies to attempted, as well as actual, witness intimidation.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n.3(a));  see United States v. Cotts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660692\"><a href=\"/opinion/660692/united-states-v-fundador-cotts-victor-fernandez-and-carlos-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 307 (7th Cir.1994) (finding enhancement proper where the defendant plotted to kill a fictional informant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the evidence only supported a finding that the assault was intended to retaliate for past cooperation (and not to prevent future acts), the obstruction of justice enhancement would be appropriate.   Application note 3(i) to the obstruction guideline states that the enhancement applies for \"conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1501-1516.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n.3(i)).   In turn, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1513(b) prohibits the infliction of bodily injury with the intent to retaliate for the providing of information relating to a federal offense.   Here, there was ample evidence that Lagasse injured Poulin in retaliation for his past cooperation.   This conduct falls squarely within the obstruction of justice guideline.   See Cotts, 14 F.3d at 308 (holding that the guideline's reference to &#167; 1513 allows an obstruction enhancement even where the motive was only to \"punish a snitch\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error in the court's enhancement of Lagasse's sentence for obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>D. Denial of Adjustment for Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lagasse contends that he was entitled to a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because he pleaded guilty within months of his arrest and appeared before a grand jury on the government's behalf.   Although the court refused to grant the adjustment, it did expressly take into account Lagasse's guilty plea when fixing a sentence in the middle of the applicable guideline range, despite the government's recommendation for the maximum imprisonment term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A two-level reduction in the offense level is warranted \"[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1.  However, \"[a] defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment [for acceptance of responsibility] as a matter of right.\"   Id. comment.  (n.3);  see also United States v. Royer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536029\"><a href=\"/opinion/536029/united-states-v-marc-a-royer/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 29-30 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that \"a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is not automatically to be conferred upon every accused who pleads guilty\").   While pleading guilty before trial and truthfully admitting the offense conduct will constitute \"significant evidence\" of acceptance of responsibility, \"this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only in \"extraordinary cases\" will the adjustment be appropriate where, as here, the defendant has received an obstruction of justice enhancement pursuant to &#167; 3E1.1.  Id. comment.  (n.4).   Other than referring to his challenge to the obstruction of justice enhancement, Lagasse does not indicate how his case might be \"extraordinary\" enough to allow the acceptance of responsibility adjustment.   Because Lagasse's case is \"ordinary\" in that the obstructive conduct \"indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct,\" id., the denial of the adjustment was proper.   See United States v. Wheelwright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551269\"><a href=\"/opinion/551269/united-states-v-john-wheelwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 229 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court alternatively found that Lagasse did not deserve the acceptance of responsibility adjustment because he was involved in an attempt to smuggle drugs into prison.   At the sentencing hearing, an MDEA agent testified that on March 25, 1995, he went to the Maine Correctional Center to investigate an anonymous tip that Lagasse's girlfriend, Grace Sheloske, would attempt to smuggle drugs into the prison that day.   When Sheloske arrived at the prison, she told the agent that she was there to visit Lagasse and eventually admitted that she was concealing a small amount of crack.   Sheloske refused to identify to whom she intended to give the drugs, stating that she did not want to \"get him in trouble.\"   A deputy United States Marshal testified that, just before the sentencing hearing, he interviewed Jeffrey Rumore--an inmate who worked for the prison laundry--who told him that Lagasse had confided to Rumore that Sheloske planned to smuggle crack into the prison and pass it during contact visits in the visiting room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this testimony, the court found that it was Rumore who tipped off the authorities of the smuggling plan, that Lagasse must have told Rumore about the plan, and thus Lagasse knew in advance that Sheloske was carrying drugs for him and indeed, that she did so at his behest.   On appeal, Lagasse argues that the court should not hold against him \"the one single occasion where an admitted drug addict tried to feed his habit,\" combined with the Poulin assault, to deny him any credit for acceptance of responsibility.   We must disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[I]t is primarily up to the district court to decide whether or not the appellant accepted responsibility for his conduct 'with candor and authentic remorse.' \"  Wheelwright, 918 F.2d at 229 (quoting Royer, 895 F.2d at 30).   We have held that, while a court may not require a defendant to accept responsibility for conduct beyond the offense of conviction, it may consider a defendant's post-offense conduct--including illegal drug activity--as evidence of the sincerity of his claimed remorse for the convicted offense.  United States v. O'Neil, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563643\"><a href=\"/opinion/563643/united-states-v-shaun-k-oneil/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span>, 599-601 (1st Cir.1991) (upholding sentencing court's consideration of post-offense use of marijuana in determining applicability of adjustment for mail theft offense);  accord United States v.

While such conduct does not compel the denial of credit for acceptance of responsibility, O'Neil, 936 F.2d at 600, the court could reasonably conclude here that Lagasse's involvement in the attempted smuggling of drugs into the prison was inconsistent with his claimed remorse, thus negating the applicability of the adjustment.
