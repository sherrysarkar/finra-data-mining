This  case arises out of  the decision\r                      Per curiam.\r                                \r\n\nof the  Town of  Amesbury, Massachusetts to  fire Michael  A.\r\n\nCronin from his position as the  Town's Chief of Police.  The\r\n\nTown terminated Cronin for falsely denying under oath that he\r\n\nhad  written a pornographic letter that was found in his desk\r\n\nat  the  Amesbury  Police  Department.   In  a  fifteen-count\r\n\ncomplaint, Cronin alleged that the Town's Board of Selectmen,\r\n\ntwo Town Managers, a  number of police officers (collectively\r\n\nthe \"Town  defendants\") and  two private citizens  (Daniel L.\r\n\nBartley and Nancy Gonthier) terminated him in violation of 42\r\n\nU.S.C.    1983 and 1985(3) and state law.  The district court\r\n\ngranted summary  judgment for  the Town  defendants on  the  \r\n\n1983 and   1985(3) counts (Counts I, II and XV) and dismissed\r\n\nthe state law counts, without  prejudice, for lack of subject\r\n\nmatter jurisdiction.1  Cronin has appealed.\r\n\n          The district  court, in  its careful review  of the\r\n\ncase, see Cronin  v. Town of Amesbury,  875 F. Supp. 375  (D.\r                                                 \r\n\nMass.  1995),  adequately  recited the  pertinent  undisputed\r\n\nfacts and there  is no  need to repeat  them in detail  here.\r\n\nEssentially, the  facts  showed that  in  early 1988  a  Town\r\n\npolice officer, Charles Wright  (one of the defendants here),\r\n\nfound  in  Cronin's desk  a  pornographic  letter written  on\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The district court entered a separate order granting a\r\nRule 12(b)(6) motion filed on behalf of Nancy Gonthier and\r\nDaniel Bartley dismissing the federal counts with prejudice\r\nand the state counts without prejudice.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nyellow  lined paper and signed \"Mike.\"  Copies were made and,\r\n\nin February  1991, one copy was shown to members of the Board\r\n\nof Selectmen.   After  a secret  meeting, the  Town suspended\r\n\nCronin with pay.\r\n\n          A series  of investigations  by Town Managers  into\r\n\nCronin's fitness to serve as police chief followed.  The Town\r\n\nManagers'  investigations,  which occurred  between  1991 and\r\n\n1993, focussed on  the letter  and on other  alleged acts  of\r\n\nmisconduct.   The first  Town Manager to  investigate, Joseph\r\n\nFahey,  recommended that  three  charges be  brought  against\r\n\nCronin and  that he be given  a 60-day suspension.   The Town\r\n\nsubsequently fired Fahey and  replaced him with Donna Stuart,\r\n\nwho,  one day  after  being appointed,  brought nine  charges\r\n\nagainst Cronin.   Public  hearings on  the nine  charges were\r\n\nheld in  front of a  civil service hearing  officer, Nicholas\r\n\nFoundas.    During those  hearings,  the letter  was  made an\r\n\nexhibit and Cronin denied under oath that the letter was his.\r\n\nOn July 7,  1992, Foundas found Cronin guilty  of only two of\r\n\nthe nine charges  and recommended  a 90-day  suspension.   He\r\n\nalso  found that Cronin had  written the letter,  but that it\r\n\nhad  no bearing  on his  duties.   Cronin appealed  Foundas's\r\n\ndecision to the Civil Service Commission.\r\n\n          Before   the   Civil  Service   Commission  decided\r\n\nCronin's   appeal,  however,   a   number  of   other  events\r\n\ntranspired.   First,  Town Manager  Stuart demoted  Cronin to\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nsergeant.  Second, the Board of Selectmen released the letter\r\n\nto the press.  Third, in October 1992, Stuart was replaced by\r\n\na  new Town  Manager, John  M. Koelsch,  who brought  two new\r\n\ncharges against Cronin -- (1) lying under oath when he denied\r\n\nauthorship of the letter at  earlier hearings and (2) conduct\r\n\nunbecoming an  officer.   Koelsch's charges were  prompted by\r\n\nDaniel  Bartley  and  Nancy Gonthier,  private  citizens  who\r\n\ncomplained that  Cronin had lied under  oath about authorship\r\n\nof  the   letter.    After  bringing   the  charges,  Koelsch\r\n\ndesignated himself hearing  officer.   On June  17, 1993,  he\r\n\nfound that  Cronin had  lied about authorship  of the  letter\r\n\nand,  in so doing, had acted  in a manner unbecoming a police\r\n\nofficer.   Cronin  was then  terminated.   Cronin immediately\r\n\nappealed Koelsch's decision to the Civil Service Commission.\r\n\n          On  July  20, 1993,  the  Civil  Service Commission\r\n\nreversed  Foundas's decision,  recommending  that  Cronin  be\r\n\nrestored to his previous position, with back pay.  As of this\r\n\ncourt's   inquiry  at   oral  argument,  the   Civil  Service\r\n\nCommission has not yet decided Cronin's appeal from Koelsch's\r\n\ndecision.\r\n\nSection 1983 Claims\r                               \r\n\n          Cronin's     1983  claims  allege   that  the  Town\r\n\ndefendants deprived  him of procedural due  process when they\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nterminated him.2  However, even assuming  for the purposes of\r\n\nthis  appeal that the  Town defendants failed  to give Cronin\r\n\nthe  procedure he was due in making the decision to terminate\r\n\nhim  (an issue on which  we take no  position), Cronin cannot\r\n\nsucceed on  his procedural  due process  claim unless  he can\r\n\nshow  that the state failed  to provide him  with an adequate\r\n\npostdeprivation remedy.   See  Lowe v.  Scott, 959 F.2d  323,\r                                                         \r\n\n340-41  (1st  Cir. 1992)  (\"[I]f  a  state provides  adequate\r\n\npostdeprivation remedies -- either  by statute or through the\r\n\ncommon-law tort remedies available in its  courts -- no claim\r\n\nof a violation of procedural due process can be brought under\r\n\n  1983  against   the  state   officials  whose  random   and\r\n\nunauthorized conduct caused the deprivation.\").\r\n\n          Here,   the   state   has   provided   an  adequate\r\n\npostdeprivation  remedy.   Massachusetts has  provided Cronin\r\n\nwith extensive  postdeprivation remedies  in the form  of the\r\n\nCivil  Service Law.  See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 31,    41-44.

L. ch. 31,   41, has a protected\r                             \r\nproperty interest in his employment and thus may invoke the\r\nprotection of the due process clause.  See Cummings v. South\r                                                                        \r\nPortland Hous. Auth., 985 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1993).  In\r                                \r\ninvoking his procedural due process claims, Cronin does not\r\nseriously argue that the established state pre-termination\r\nprocedures are deficient.  Rather, Cronin's claims rest on\r\nalleged random and unauthorized acts by the Town defendants. \r\nSee Marino v. Ameruso, 837 F.2d 45, 47 (2d Cir. 1988).  He\r                                 \r\ngenerally argues that the Town defendants were out to get\r\nhim, and, with respect to the termination specifically, he\r\nargues that Koelsch was biased and made evidentiary errors.   \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nperson   aggrieved   by  a   decision   of   the  \"appointing\r\n\nauthority\"3 may  appeal to  the Civil Service  Commission and\r\n\nbe given a hearing before a  member of the Commission or some\r\n\ndisinterested person.   The Commission may  affirm or reverse\r\n\nthe action  of the appointing  authority.  If  the appointing\r\n\nauthority's  decision  is  reversed,  the  employee  must  be\r\n\nreinstated without loss  of compensation or other rights.  If\r\n\nthe  employee  is   dissatisfied  with   the  Civil   Service\r\n\nCommission's decision, he or  she may appeal to the  Superior\r\n\nCourt.  See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 31,   44.\r                       \r\n\n          Cronin complains that the Civil  Service Commission\r\n\nhas  taken  too long  to  decide  his appeal  from  Koelsch's\r\n\ndecision.  Although extraordinarily  long delays may render a\r\n\npostdeprivation remedy inadequate, that is not the case here.\r\n\nSee Alton Land Trust v. Town of Alton, 745 F.2d 730, 732 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.  1984)  (two  and   one-half  year  litigation  was  not\r\n\ninordinate delay).  Despite  the almost three-year delay, the\r\n\npossibility  of reinstatement with back pay remains available\r\n\nto him.  See Decker v. Hillsborough County Attorney's Office,\r                                                                        \r\n\n845  F.2d 17,  22 (1st  Cir. 1988)  (although there  had been\r\n\ndelay, New Hampshire had not yet refused to provide plaintiff\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Koelsch, as Town Manager, was the appointing authority. \r\nSee Mass. Gen. L. ch. 31,   1; see also Amesbury Town\r                                                   \r\nCharter, Art. 4,   4-21(b).\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nwith  a remedy).  We affirm the district court's dismissal of\r\n\nthe   1983 claims.4\r\n\nSection 1985(3) Claim\r                                 \r\n\n          Cronin   also  argues   that  the   district  court\r\n\nerroneously granted  summary judgment on his    1985(3) claim\r\n\nagainst  the Town  defendants and  erroneously dismissed  his\r\n\n  1985(3)  claim  filed  against  Nancy Gonthier  and  Daniel\r\n\nBartley.   Section 1985(3),  which prohibits  conspiracies to\r\n\ndeprive  persons   of  rights  or   privileges,  requires  an\r\n\n\"invidiously  discriminatory animus\" in  which the defendants\r\n\nhave taken the action because of \"its adverse effects upon an\r\n\nidentifiable  group.\"    Bray v.  Alexandria  Women's  Health\r                                                                         \r\n\nClinic, 113  S. Ct.  753, 760-61 (1993)  (internal quotations\r                  \r\n\nomitted).  No  such animus  was even alleged  here.   Summary\r\n\njudgment was properly entered in favor of the Town defendants\r\n\nand  dismissal was  properly granted  for Nancy  Gonthier and\r\n\nDaniel Bartley.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Cronin also argues (1) that the Town defendants violated\r\nhis procedural due process rights when they suspended him\r\nwith pay and when they demoted him to sergeant; and (2) that\r\nthe Town defendants violated his right to petition, his right\r\nto confrontation, and his right to privacy (although he has\r\nbeen unable to articulate any cognizable theory).  These\r\narguments are without merit.  Appellants' additional\r\narguments, (1) that the district court erred in dismissing\r\nthe state law claims, (2) that the district court erred in\r\nits various rulings on discovery practices, and (3) that the\r\ndistrict court erred in denying appellants' motion for relief\r\nfrom judgment, are also all meritless. \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nGonthier and Bartley's Motion for Damages and Costs\r                                                               \r\n\n          Notwithstanding  the  obvious  correctness  of  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's dismissal  of  the   1985(3)  count  lodged\r\n\nagainst Gonthier  and Bartley,  Cronin  has sought  appellate\r\n\nreview of the dismissal.   Gonthier and Bartley have  filed a\r\n\nseparate motion for damages  and costs under Fed. R.  App. P.\r\n\n38  and Cronin  has responded.5   Federal  Rule  of Appellate\r\n\nProcedure 38 provides that  if an appellate court \"determines\r\n\nthat an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed\r\n\nmotion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to\r\n\nrespond, award just damages and single or double costs to the\r\n\nappellee.\"   Fed. R. App. P.  38.  An appeal  is frivolous if\r\n\nthe result is  obvious or the  arguments are \"wholly  without\r\n\nmerit.\"   Westcott Constr. Corp.  v. Fireman's Fund  of N.J.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n996  F.2d  14,  17   (1st  Cir.  1993)  (internal  quotations\r\n\nomitted).   \"[I]t  is enough  that the  appellants  and their\r\n\nattorney should have been aware that the appeal had no chance\r\n\nof success.\"  E.H.

Not  surprisingly, Cronin  failed to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Cronin's response was filed ten days after Gonthier's and\r\nBartley's motion was filed.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\narticulate  in  his  brief any  reasoned  basis  for why  the\r\n\ndistrict court erroneously dismissed the   1985(3) count.  He\r\n\ninstead  pressed  a  bizarre  and  irrelevant  argument  that\r\n\nFederal Rule of Civil  Procedure 54(b) precluded the district\r\n\ncourt  from entering  a  separate judgment  for Gonthier  and\r\n\nBartley.   When the appellees  in their brief  properly noted\r\n\nthat the Rule  54(b) argument was  baseless, Cronin used  the\r\n\nreply  brief to try to transform his Rule 54(b) argument into\r\n\na variant of a  pendent party jurisdiction argument.   Such a\r\n\npendent party  argument was never raised  before the district\r\n\ncourt nor in the initial briefing on appeal.  One might think\r\n\nthat Cronin created such an argument to conceal the fact that\r\n\nthe appeal from the dismissal of the claims against  Gonthier\r\n\nand Bartley was wholly without merit.\r\n\n          A penalty is appropriate here.  Rule 38  allows the\r\n\naward  of attorneys'  fees  as \"just  damages\" for  frivolous\r\n\nappeals.  See Natasha, Inc.  v.

Cronin from his position as the Town's Chief of Police.   The Town terminated Cronin for falsely denying under oath that he had written a pornographic letter that was found in his desk at the Amesbury Police Department.   In a fifteen-count complaint, Cronin alleged that the Town's Board of Selectmen, two Town Managers, a number of police officers (collectively the \"Town defendants\") and two private citizens (Daniel L. Bartley and Nancy Gonthier) terminated him in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1985(3) and state law.   The district court granted summary judgment for the Town defendants on the &#167; 1983 and &#167; 1985(3) counts (Counts I, II and XV) and dismissed the state law counts, without prejudice, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Cronin has appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in its careful review of the case, see Cronin v. Town of Amesbury, 895 F.Supp. 375 (D.Mass.1995), adequately recited the pertinent undisputed facts and there is no need to repeat them in detail here.   Essentially, the facts showed that in early 1988 a Town police officer, Charles Wright (one of the defendants here), found in Cronin's desk a pornographic letter written on yellow lined paper and signed \"Mike.\"   Copies were made and, in February 1991, one copy was shown to members of the Board of Selectmen.   After a secret meeting, the Town suspended Cronin with pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A series of investigations by Town Managers into Cronin's fitness to serve as police chief followed.   The Town Managers' investigations, which occurred between 1991 and 1993, focussed on the letter and on other alleged acts of misconduct.   The first Town Manager to investigate, Joseph Fahey, recommended that three charges be brought against Cronin and that he be given a 60-day suspension.   The Town subsequently fired Fahey and replaced him with Donna Stuart, who, one day after being appointed, brought nine charges against Cronin.   Public hearings on the nine charges were held in front of a civil service hearing officer, Nicholas Foundas.   During those hearings, the letter was made an exhibit and Cronin denied under oath that the letter was his.   On July 7, 1992, Foundas found Cronin guilty of only two of the nine charges and recommended a 90-day suspension.   He also found that Cronin had written the letter, but that it had no bearing on his duties.   Cronin appealed Foundas's decision to the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the Civil Service Commission decided Cronin's appeal, however, a number of other events transpired.   First, Town Manager Stuart demoted Cronin to sergeant.   Second, the Board of Selectmen released the letter to the press.   Third, in October 1992, Stuart was replaced by a new Town Manager, John M. Koelsch, who brought two new charges against Cronin--(1) lying under oath when he denied authorship of the letter at earlier hearings and (2) conduct unbecoming an officer.   Koelsch's charges were prompted by Daniel Bartley and Nancy Gonthier, private citizens who complained that Cronin had lied under oath about authorship of the letter.   After bringing the charges, Koelsch designated himself hearing officer.   On June 17, 1993, he found that Cronin had lied about authorship of the letter and, in so doing, had acted in a manner unbecoming a police officer.   Cronin was then terminated.   Cronin immediately appealed Koelsch's decision to the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 20, 1993, the Civil Service Commission reversed Foundas's decision, recommending that Cronin be restored to his previous position, with back pay.   As of this court's inquiry at oral argument, the Civil Service Commission has not yet decided Cronin's appeal from Koelsch's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Section 1983 Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cronin's &#167; 1983 claims allege that the Town defendants deprived him of procedural due process when they terminated him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  However, even assuming for the purposes of this appeal that the Town defendants failed to give Cronin the procedure he was due in making the decision to terminate him (an issue on which we take no position), Cronin cannot succeed on his procedural due process claim unless he can show that the state failed to provide him with an adequate postdeprivation remedy.   See Lowe v. Scott, 959 F.2d 323, 340-41 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[I]f a state provides adequate postdeprivation remedies--either by statute or through the common-law tort remedies available in its courts--no claim of a violation of procedural due process can be brought under &#167; 1983 against the state officials whose random and unauthorized conduct caused the deprivation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the state has provided an adequate postdeprivation remedy.   Massachusetts has provided Cronin with extensive postdeprivation remedies in the form of the Civil Service Law.   See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 31, &#167;&#167; 41-44.   Any person aggrieved by a decision of the \"appointing authority\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> may appeal to the Civil Service Commission and be given a hearing before a member of the Commission or some disinterested person.   The Commission may affirm or reverse the action of the appointing authority.   If the appointing authority's decision is reversed, the employee must be reinstated without loss of compensation or other rights.   If the employee is dissatisfied with the Civil Service Commission's decision, he or she may appeal to the Superior Court.   See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 31, &#167; 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cronin complains that the Civil Service Commission has taken too long to decide his appeal from Koelsch's decision.   Although extraordinarily long delays may render a postdeprivation remedy inadequate, that is not the case here.   See Alton Land Trust v. Town of Alton, 745 F.2d 730, 732 (1st Cir.1984) (two and one-half year litigation was not inordinate delay).   Despite the almost three-year delay, the possibility of reinstatement with back pay remains available to him.   See Decker v. Hillsborough County Attorney's Office, 845 F.2d 17, 22 (1st Cir.1988) (although there had been delay, New Hampshire had not yet refused to provide plaintiff with a remedy).   We affirm the district court's dismissal of the &#167; 1983 claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Section 1985(3) Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cronin also argues that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment on his &#167; 1985(3) claim against the Town defendants and erroneously dismissed his &#167; 1985(3) claim filed against Nancy Gonthier and Daniel Bartley.   Section 1985(3), which prohibits conspiracies to deprive persons of rights or privileges, requires an \"invidiously discriminatory animus\" in which the defendants have taken the action because of \"its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\"  Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270-72, 113 S.Ct. 753, 760-61, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 (1993) (internal quotations omitted).   No such animus was even alleged here.   Summary judgment was properly entered in favor of the Town defendants and dismissal was properly granted for Nancy Gonthier and Daniel Bartley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Gonthier and Bartley's Motion for Damages and Costs</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the obvious correctness of the district court's dismissal of the &#167; 1985(3) count lodged against Gonthier and Bartley, Cronin has sought appellate review of the dismissal.   Gonthier and Bartley have filed a separate motion for damages and costs under Fed.R.App.P. 38 and Cronin has responded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 provides that if an appellate court \"determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\"   Fed.R.App.P. 38.   An appeal is frivolous if the result is obvious or the arguments are \"wholly without merit.\"  Westcott Constr.  Corp. v. Firemen's Fund of N.J., 996 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1993) (internal quotations omitted).  \"[I]t is enough that the appellants and their attorney should have been aware that the appeal had no chance of success.\"  E.H. Ashley &amp; Co., Inc. v. Wells Fargo Alarm Servs., 907 F.2d 1274, 1280 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even a cursory reading of the relevant case law and treatises would have revealed that the &#167; 1985(3) claim was not properly brought.   Not surprisingly, Cronin failed to articulate in his brief any reasoned basis for why the district court erroneously dismissed the &#167; 1985(3) count.   He instead pressed a bizarre and irrelevant argument that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) precluded the district court from entering a separate judgment for Gonthier and Bartley.   When the appellees in their brief properly noted that the Rule 54(b) argument was baseless, Cronin used the reply brief to try to transform his Rule 54(b) argument into a variant of a pendent party jurisdiction argument.   Such a pendent party argument was never raised before the district court nor in the initial briefing on appeal.   One might think that Cronin created such an argument to conceal the fact that the appeal from the dismissal of the claims against Gonthier and Bartley was wholly without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A penalty is appropriate here.   Rule 38 allows the award of attorneys' fees as \"just damages\" for frivolous appeals.   See Natasha, Inc. v. Evita Marine Charters, Inc., 763 F.2d 468, 472 (1st Cir.1985);  see also Fed.R.App.P. 38 advisory committee's notes.   This court can assess a particular amount or \"reasonable counsel fees\" as damages without additional submissions by the parties.  Natasha, 763 F.2d at 472 (internal quotations omitted);  see also Tomczyk v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield United of Wisconsin, 51 F.2d 771, 779-80 &amp; n. 4 (7th Cir.1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 940, 112 S.Ct. 2274, 119 L.Ed.2d 201 (1992).   Gonthier and Bartley assert that they have incurred legal fees in responding to this appeal of $2,725.00, exclusive of costs.   We believe such fees are reasonable and assess that amount as just damages to the appellees.   We also assess double costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bulk of the blame for the frivolous appeal rests with appellants' attorney.   An attorney's duty to represent a client zealously is not a license to harass.   When the appellants' attorney sought to appeal the district court's dismissal of the &#167; 1985(3) claim against Gonthier and Bartley, he crossed the line from zealous advocacy to vexatious advocacy, needlessly multiplying the proceedings in this case.   Under such circumstances, it is appropriate to sanction the attorney personally for the excess costs, expenses and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred.   See Fed.R.App.P. 38;  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1927;  Cruz v. Savage, 896 F.2d 626, 635 (1st Cir.1990) (frivolous appeal warranted assessment of double costs and attorneys' fees against attorney under Rule 38 and &#167; 1927).   We therefore apportion the damages award and order that $2,500.00 of the award be assessed directly against appellants' attorney.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The remaining $225.00 shall be assessed against appellant Michael Cronin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Double costs shall be born jointly and severally by Michael Cronin and appellants' attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.  Appellees' Motion for Damages for Frivolous Appeal is granted, with double costs and damages to be apportioned in the manner prescribed in this opinion.   It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court entered a separate order granting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion filed on behalf of Nancy Gonthier and Daniel Bartley dismissing the federal counts with prejudice and the state counts without prejudice</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Cronin, who under state law can only be terminated for \"just cause,\" see Mass.Gen.L. ch. 31, &#167; 41, has a protected property interest in his employment and thus may invoke the protection of the due process clause.   See Cummings v. South Portland Hous.  Auth., 985 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1993).   In invoking his procedural due process claims, Cronin does not seriously argue that the established state pre-termination procedures are deficient.   Rather, Cronin's claims rest on alleged random and unauthorized acts by the Town defendants.   See Marino v. Ameruso, 837 F.2d 45, 47 (2d Cir.1988).   He generally argues that the Town defendants were out to get him, and, with respect to the termination specifically, he argues that Koelsch was biased and made evidentiary errors</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Koelsch, as Town Manager, was the appointing authority.

These arguments are without merit.   Appellants' additional arguments, (1) that the district court erred in dismissing the state law claims, (2) that the district court erred in its various rulings on discovery practices, and (3) that the district court erred in denying appellants' motion for relief from judgment, are also all meritless</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Cronin's response was filed ten days after Gonthier's and Bartley's motion was filed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The award of damages against appellants' attorney shall run against Peter Antell, not J.

Cronin from his position as the Town's Chief of Police.   The Town terminated Cronin for falsely denying under oath that he had written a pornographic letter that was found in his desk at the Amesbury Police Department.   In a fifteen-count complaint, Cronin alleged that the Town's Board of Selectmen, two Town Managers, a number of police officers (collectively the \"Town defendants\") and two private citizens (Daniel L. Bartley and Nancy Gonthier) terminated him in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1985(3) and state law.   The district court granted summary judgment for the Town defendants on the &#167; 1983 and &#167; 1985(3) counts (Counts I, II and XV) and dismissed the state law counts, without prejudice, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Cronin has appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in its careful review of the case, see Cronin v. Town of Amesbury, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></span> (D.Mass.1995), adequately recited the pertinent undisputed facts and there is no need to repeat them in detail here.   Essentially, the facts showed that in early 1988 a Town police officer, Charles Wright (one of the defendants here), found in Cronin's desk a pornographic letter written on yellow lined paper and signed \"Mike.\"   Copies were made and, in February 1991, one copy was shown to members of the Board of Selectmen.   After a secret meeting, the Town suspended Cronin with pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A series of investigations by Town Managers into Cronin's fitness to serve as police chief followed.   The Town Managers' investigations, which occurred between 1991 and 1993, focussed on the letter and on other alleged acts of misconduct.   The first Town Manager to investigate, Joseph Fahey, recommended that three charges be brought against Cronin and that he be given a 60-day suspension.   The Town subsequently fired Fahey and replaced him with Donna Stuart, who, one day after being appointed, brought nine charges against Cronin.   Public hearings on the nine charges were held in front of a civil service hearing officer, Nicholas Foundas.   During those hearings, the letter was made an exhibit and Cronin denied under oath that the letter was his.   On July 7, 1992, Foundas found Cronin guilty of only two of the nine charges and recommended a 90-day suspension.   He also found that Cronin had written the letter, but that it had no bearing on his duties.   Cronin appealed Foundas's decision to the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the Civil Service Commission decided Cronin's appeal, however, a number of other events transpired.   First, Town Manager Stuart demoted Cronin to sergeant.   Second, the Board of Selectmen released the letter to the press.   Third, in October 1992, Stuart was replaced by a new Town Manager, John M. Koelsch, who brought two new charges against Cronin--(1) lying under oath when he denied authorship of the letter at earlier hearings and (2) conduct unbecoming an officer.   Koelsch's charges were prompted by Daniel Bartley and Nancy Gonthier, private citizens who complained that Cronin had lied under oath about authorship of the letter.   After bringing the charges, Koelsch designated himself hearing officer.   On June 17, 1993, he found that Cronin had lied about authorship of the letter and, in so doing, had acted in a manner unbecoming a police officer.   Cronin was then terminated.   Cronin immediately appealed Koelsch's decision to the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 20, 1993, the Civil Service Commission reversed Foundas's decision, recommending that Cronin be restored to his previous position, with back pay.   As of this court's inquiry at oral argument, the Civil Service Commission has not yet decided Cronin's appeal from Koelsch's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Section 1983 Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cronin's &#167; 1983 claims allege that the Town defendants deprived him of procedural due process when they terminated him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  However, even assuming for the purposes of this appeal that the Town defendants failed to give Cronin the procedure he was due in making the decision to terminate him (an issue on which we take no position), Cronin cannot succeed on his procedural due process claim unless he can show that the state failed to provide him with an adequate postdeprivation remedy.   See Lowe v. Scott, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579944\"><a href=\"/opinion/579944/lynn-c-lowe-md-v-h-denman-scott-md/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 340-41 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[I]f a state provides adequate postdeprivation remedies--either by statute or through the common-law tort remedies available in its courts--no claim of a violation of procedural due process can be brought under &#167; 1983 against the state officials whose random and unauthorized conduct caused the deprivation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the state has provided an adequate postdeprivation remedy.   Massachusetts has provided Cronin with extensive postdeprivation remedies in the form of the Civil Service Law.   See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 31, &#167;&#167; 41-44.   Any person aggrieved by a decision of the \"appointing authority\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> may appeal to the Civil Service Commission and be given a hearing before a member of the Commission or some disinterested person.   The Commission may affirm or reverse the action of the appointing authority.   If the appointing authority's decision is reversed, the employee must be reinstated without loss of compensation or other rights.   If the employee is dissatisfied with the Civil Service Commission's decision, he or she may appeal to the Superior Court.   See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 31, &#167; 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cronin complains that the Civil Service Commission has taken too long to decide his appeal from Koelsch's decision.   Although extraordinarily long delays may render a postdeprivation remedy inadequate, that is not the case here.   See Alton Land Trust v. Town of Alton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442865\"><a href=\"/opinion/442865/alton-land-trust-and-cedar-mountain-development-corporation-v-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span>, 732 (1st Cir.1984) (two and one-half year litigation was not inordinate delay).   Despite the almost three-year delay, the possibility of reinstatement with back pay remains available to him.   See Decker v. Hillsborough County Attorney's Office, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504706\"><a href=\"/opinion/504706/robert-w-decker-v-hillsborough-county-attorneys-office-robert-w-decker/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1988) (although there had been delay, New Hampshire had not yet refused to provide plaintiff with a remedy).   We affirm the district court's dismissal of the &#167; 1983 claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Section 1985(3) Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cronin also argues that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment on his &#167; 1985(3) claim against the Town defendants and erroneously dismissed his &#167; 1985(3) claim filed against Nancy Gonthier and Daniel Bartley.   Section 1985(3), which prohibits conspiracies to deprive persons of rights or privileges, requires an \"invidiously discriminatory animus\" in which the defendants have taken the action because of \"its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\"  Bray v.

Gonthier and Bartley have filed a separate motion for damages and costs under Fed.R.App.P. 38 and Cronin has responded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 provides that if an appellate court \"determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\"   Fed.R.App.P. 38.   An appeal is frivolous if the result is obvious or the arguments are \"wholly without merit.\"  Westcott Constr.  Corp. v.

Not surprisingly, Cronin failed to articulate in his brief any reasoned basis for why the district court erroneously dismissed the &#167; 1985(3) count.   He instead pressed a bizarre and irrelevant argument that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) precluded the district court from entering a separate judgment for Gonthier and Bartley.   When the appellees in their brief properly noted that the Rule 54(b) argument was baseless, Cronin used the reply brief to try to transform his Rule 54(b) argument into a variant of a pendent party jurisdiction argument.   Such a pendent party argument was never raised before the district court nor in the initial briefing on appeal.   One might think that Cronin created such an argument to conceal the fact that the appeal from the dismissal of the claims against Gonthier and Bartley was wholly without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A penalty is appropriate here.   Rule 38 allows the award of attorneys' fees as \"just damages\" for frivolous appeals.   See Natasha, Inc. v. Evita Marine Charters, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453179\"><a href=\"/opinion/453179/natasha-inc-v-evita-marine-charters-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, 472 (1st Cir.1985);  see also Fed.R.App.P. 38 advisory committee's notes.   This court can assess a particular amount or \"reasonable counsel fees\" as damages without additional submissions by the parties.  Natasha, 763 F.2d at 472 (internal quotations omitted);  see also Tomczyk v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield United of Wisconsin, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></span>, 779-80 &amp; n. 4 (7th Cir.1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></span> (1992).   Gonthier and Bartley assert that they have incurred legal fees in responding to this appeal of $2,725.00, exclusive of costs.   We believe such fees are reasonable and assess that amount as just damages to the appellees.   We also assess double costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bulk of the blame for the frivolous appeal rests with appellants' attorney.   An attorney's duty to represent a client zealously is not a license to harass.   When the appellants' attorney sought to appeal the district court's dismissal of the &#167; 1985(3) claim against Gonthier and Bartley, he crossed the line from zealous advocacy to vexatious advocacy, needlessly multiplying the proceedings in this case.   Under such circumstances, it is appropriate to sanction the attorney personally for the excess costs, expenses and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred.   See Fed.R.App.P. 38;  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1927;  Cruz v. Savage, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536974\"><a href=\"/opinion/536974/juan-e-cruz-v-robert-savage-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span>, 635 (1st Cir.1990) (frivolous appeal warranted assessment of double costs and attorneys' fees against attorney under Rule 38 and &#167; 1927).   We therefore apportion the damages award and order that $2,500.00 of the award be assessed directly against appellants' attorney.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The remaining $225.00 shall be assessed against appellant Michael Cronin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Double costs shall be born jointly and severally by Michael Cronin and appellants' attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

In invoking his procedural due process claims, Cronin does not seriously argue that the established state pre-termination procedures are deficient.   Rather, Cronin's claims rest on alleged random and unauthorized acts by the Town defendants.   See Marino v. Ameruso, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500047\"><a href=\"/opinion/500047/damien-marino-v-anthony-ameruso-commissioner-of-the-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 47 (2d Cir.1988).

These arguments are without merit.   Appellants' additional arguments, (1) that the district court erred in dismissing the state law claims, (2) that the district court erred in its various rulings on discovery practices, and (3) that the district court erred in denying appellants' motion for relief from judgment, are also all meritless</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Cronin's response was filed ten days after Gonthier's and Bartley's motion was filed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The award of damages against appellants' attorney shall run against Peter Antell, not J.
