Quiles-\r\nEspinosa, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Camille Velez-Rive,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMAY 27, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Upon careful consideration of the briefs and\r\nrecord presented for this appeal, we conclude that the sentence\r\nimposed upon revocation of supervised release was within the\r\ndistrict court's authority under 18 U.S.C.  3583(e)(3) and was not\r\ninconsistent with U.S.S.G.  7B1.4.  See United States v. O'Neil,\r\n11 F.3d 292, 301 n.11 (1st Cir. 1993).  In our view, the district\r\ncourt adequately explained the reasons for the sentence.\r\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
