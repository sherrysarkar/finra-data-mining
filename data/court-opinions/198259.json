DOUGLAS,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n         NEW HAMPSHIRE SUPREME COURT PROFESSIONAL\r\n                CONDUCT COMMITTEE, ET AL.,\r\n\n                  Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n     [Hon. Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n               Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Caroline G. Douglas on brief pro se.\r\n Philip T. McLaughlin, Attorney General and Daniel J. Mullen,\r\nSenior Assistant Attorney General on brief for appellees.\r\n\nDecember 29, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Plaintiff Caroline Douglas appeals a\r\ndistrict court judgment that dismissed her amended complaint\r\nfor declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the New\r\nHampshire Supreme Court Professional Conduct Committee (NHPCC) \r\nfrom instituting disciplinary proceedings against her.  The\r\ndistrict court's dismissal order was based on the abstention\r\nprinciple enunciated in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971),\r\nand extended to attorney disciplinary proceedings in Middlesex\r\nCounty Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar Association, 457\r\nU.S. 423 (1982).  \r\n          Applying de novo review, see Brooks v. New Hampshire\r\nSupreme Court, 80 F.3d 633, 638 (1st Cir. 1996), we affirm. \r\nThe allegations in plaintiff's amended complaint establish that\r\nthe disciplinary investigations commenced by the NHPCC are the\r\nsort of judicial proceedings that warrant abstention, as\r\nevidenced by the cases cited in the district court's opinion. \r\nPlaintiff's argument to the contrary is meritless.  See, e.g.,\r\nWightman v. Texas Supreme Court, 84 F.3d 188, 190-91 (5th Cir.\r\n1996)(applying Younger to disciplinary proceeding in its early\r\nstages), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 744 (1997); Fieger v. Thomas,\r\n74 F.3d 740, 746-49 (6th Cir. 1996)(applying Younger where\r\nattorney could raise constitutional claims before state bar\r\ndisciplinary board and, via petition for mandamus or petition\r\nfor discretionary review, before state supreme court); Brooks,\r\n80 F.3d at 638 (applying Younger where, inter alia, state\r\ndisciplinary proceeding was only in the \"embryonic\" stage).    The allegations in plaintiff's amended complaint are\r\nalso insufficient to state a claim within the \"bad faith\"\r\nexception to the Younger principle.  See Wightman, 84 F.3d at\r\n190 (\"[t]he bad faith exception is narrow and is to be granted\r\nparsimoniously\"); Bettencourt v. Board of Registration in\r\nMedicine, 904 F.2d 772, 779 (1st Cir. 1990)(similar). \r\nPlaintiff's conclusory allegation that she was acting as a\r\nprivate citizen is insufficient to suggest that the NHPCC acted\r\nin bad faith in opening its investigations.  See Judge v. City\r\nof Lowell,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1998), 1998 WESTLAW\r\n789187 at *4(\"the element of illegal motive must be pleaded by\r\nalleging specific non-conclusory facts from which such a motive\r\nmay reasonably be inferred, not merely by generalized\r\nasseveration alone[]\"); Collins v. County of Kendall, Illinois,\r\n807 F.2d 95, 98 (7th Cir. 1986)(plaintiff asserting bad faith\r\nprosecution must allege specific facts to support an inference\r\nof bad faith).  Plaintiff's allegation that the NHPCC followed\r\nimproper procedures in initiating the September 15, 1997\r\ncomplaint also fails to raise the specter of bad faith, for\r\nplaintiff has failed to identify any rule that prohibited the\r\nopening of the complaint in the fashion alleged.  We further\r\ncannot say that the \"Hewson complaint\" described a scenario\r\nthat was patently beyond the NHPCC's jurisdiction, nor that its\r\ndocketing was a \"manifest\" example of bad faith.    Finally,\r\nthat the NHPCC failed to pursue a number of complaints against\r\nplaintiff's ex-husband is irrelevant to whether the complaints\r\nagainst plaintiff were opened in bad faith.  See Mason v.\r\nDepartmental Disciplinary Committee, 894 F.2d 512, 515 (2d Cir.\r\n1990)(allegation that professional conduct board was at fault\r\nbecause it failed to adjudicate misconduct charges against\r\nothers was irrelevant to determining propriety of board's\r\ninquiry into plaintiff).    Finally, plaintiff's allegations\r\nconcerning the NHPCC's alleged  bias in favor of politically\r\ninfluential attorneys are too general to overcome the\r\npresumption of integrity that we must ascribe to the\r\ndefendants.  See, e.g., Hirsh v. Justices of the Supreme Court\r\nof California, 67 F.3d 708, 713 (9th Cir. 1995); Bettencourt,\r\n904 F.2d at 780.   \r\n   Affirmed.    \r\n",
