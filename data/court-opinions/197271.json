Among other  things, he\r\n\nsought  an order  halting  Artery construction  and directing\r\n\ndetailed review of his proposal.  After careful review of the\r\n\nrecord,  we affirm essentially  for the reasons  given by the\r\n\ndistrict  court  in  its  well  reasoned  decisions  granting\r\n\nsummary judgment.  We add only the following comments.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1The   district   court  granted   summary   judgment  for\r               1\r\ndefendants on  Zarrilli's original  complaint in Zarrilli  v.\r                                                                     \r\nWeld, 875 F.  Supp. 68 (D. Mass. 1995).   Among other things,\r                \r\nthe  court  ruled  that  certain of  Zarrilli's  claims  were\r\nuntimely and it dismissed state  agencies from the suit under\r\nthe Eleventh Amendment.  The court granted  Zarrilli leave to\r\namend his complaint  to state any  timely claims against  the\r\nremaining  defendants.    Zarrilli  then   filed  an  amended\r\ncomplaint.  In  an unpublished order dated  October 25, 1995,\r\nthe   court  granted  the   defendants'  motion  for  summary\r\njudgment, dismissing the amended complaint on the ground that\r\nthe complaint did  not state  a claim for  relief and  stated\r\nuntimely claims.   The  court subsequently  denied Zarrilli's\r\nmotion to reconsider.\r\r\n\n          The  amended  complaint asserted  only  one federal\r\n\nclaim  against  the  state  defendants.2   Zarrilli  has  not\r                                                   2\r\n\nchallenged the district court's ruling limiting his 42 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1983 claims against the state defendants to claims  arising\r\n\nafter August 12,  1991.  See Zarrilli  v. Weld, 875  F. Supp.\r                                                          \r\n\n68, 72 (D.  Mass. 1995).   Four of  the Environmental  Impact\r\n\nStatements  listed  by Zarrilli  in  Count 1  of  the amended\r\n\ncomplaint were published subsequent to August 12,  1991.  But\r\n\nZarrilli makes no mention  of these statements on appeal  and\r\n\nthus  would appear to have  abandoned these claims.   None of\r\n\nthe  other allegations  in  the amended  complaint forms  the\r\n\nbasis for  a timely  complaint against the  state defendants.\r\n\nAt bottom, Zarrilli objected to the defendants' assessment of\r\n\nhis Bypass proposal as of November 1990 or earlier, a clearly\r\n\nbarred  claim.   His  reassertion of  that  claim in  letters\r\n\nwritten to  state  defendants within  the limitations  period\r\n\ndoes not make the claim timely.3    \r                                           3\r\n\n          Nor  has Zarrilli  challenged the  district court's\r\n\napplication of  the six-year limitations period  set forth in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2Zarrilli  also brought pendent  state law  claims against\r               2\r\nthe state  defendants, but  has not  pressed those claims  on\r\nappeal.   In addition, he  alleged that the  state defendants\r\nhad  violated his  rights by  not publishing  a draft  of the\r\nNovember  1990  Final Environmental  Impact Statement/Report,\r\nbut now concedes that they had no obligation to do so.\r\n\n   3We  do  not  consider  his  claim  that  the  defendants'\r               3\r\nfraudulent  concealment of  material  information tolled  the\r\nlimitations  period,  which  is  the subject  of  a  separate\r\nappeal.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n28  U.S.C.    2401(a)  for civil  actions against  the United\r\n\nStates, which  would only  bar claims that  accrued prior  to\r\n\nAugust of 1988.  Indeed, the federal defendants have conceded\r\n\nthat the amended  complaint stated non-barred  claims against\r\n\nthem.   Zarrilli  asserted  that the  defendants should  have\r\n\npublished  a Supplemental  Environmental Impact  Statement on\r\n\nhis Bypass proposal as part of the 1990-91 Final Supplemental\r\n\nEnvironmental   Impact   Statement/Report.     However,  even\r\n\nassuming that  defendants had  an obligation to  evaluate his\r\n\nBypass  proposal, Zarrilli  has not  shown that,  in relevant\r\n\nrespects,   his   proposal    contained   \"significant    new\r\n\ncircumstances or information\"  about the environmental impact\r\n\nof the Artery project or that it was a reasonable alternative\r\n\nto the Central Artery  project.  Consequently, defendants had\r\n\nno  obligation   to  give  the  proposal   any  more  serious\r\n\nconsideration   than   they   did.      See   40   C.F.R.    \r                                                       \r\n\n1502.9(c)(1)(ii)  (an  agency  must  prepare  a  supplemental\r\n\nenvironmental  impact statement if there are \"significant new\r\n\ncircumstances  or  information   relevant  to   environmental\r\n\nconcerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts\");\r\n\nForty Most Asked Questions Concerning CEQ's NEPA Regulations,\r\n\n46 Fed. Reg. 18026,  # 29b (1981) (requiring the  issuance of\r\n\nsupplemental or draft  supplemental environmental  statements\r\n\non new alternatives which are \"reasonable\").\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          Zarrilli made several other complaints as well.  He\r\n\nasserted  that the  1990-91 Final  Supplemental Environmental\r\n\nImpact  Statement/Report was  inadequate  because it  did not\r\n\ncontain a \"worst  case analysis.\"   But such  an analysis  is\r\n\nonly  required   when  there   are  gaps  in   the  available\r\n\ninformation, and Zarrilli has shown no such uncertainty here.\r\n\nZarrilli   argued   that  the   1990-91   Final  Supplemental\r\n\nEnvironmental   Impact   Statement/Report  violated   federal\r\n\nregulations because  it was  not specific  enough.   But  the\r\n\napplicable regulations  do not require  agencies to  evaluate\r\n\nall   comments  exhaustively.     Another  acceptable  agency\r\n\nresponse is the one the defendants chose to make -- providing\r\n\nvalid reasons  for why Zarrilli's proposal did  not warrant a\r\n\ndetailed  response.   Finally, Zarrilli  complained that  the\r\n\ndefendants failed to publish his full proposal in the 1990-91\r\n\nFinal Supplemental Environmental  Impact Statement/Report  in\r\n\nviolation of NEPA Reg.   1503.4(b).   However, the regulation\r\n\nexplicitly  permits  summaries  of  exceptionally  voluminous\r\n\ncomments, and Zarrilli's proposal  certainly falls into  this\r\n\ncategory.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

However,  even\r\n\nassuming that  defendants had  an obligation to  evaluate his\r\n\nBypass  proposal, Zarrilli  has not  shown that,  in relevant\r\n\nrespects,   his   proposal    contained   \"significant    new\r\n\ncircumstances or information\"  about the environmental impact\r\n\nof the Artery project or that it was a reasonable alternative\r\n\nto the Central Artery  project.  Consequently, defendants had\r\n\nno  obligation   to  give  the  proposal   any  more  serious\r\n\nconsideration   than   they   did.      See   40   C.F.R.    \r                                                       \r\n\n1502.9(c)(1)(ii)  (an  agency  must  prepare  a  supplemental\r\n\nenvironmental  impact statement if there are \"significant new\r\n\ncircumstances  or  information   relevant  to   environmental\r\n\nconcerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts\");\r\n\nForty Most Asked Questions Concerning CEQ's NEPA Regulations,\r\n\n46 Fed. Reg. 18026,  # 29b (1981) (requiring the  issuance of\r\n\nsupplemental or draft  supplemental environmental  statements\r\n\non new alternatives which are \"reasonable\").\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          Zarrilli made several other complaints as well.  He\r\n\nasserted  that the  1990-91 Final  Supplemental Environmental\r\n\nImpact  Statement/Report was  inadequate  because it  did not\r\n\ncontain a \"worst  case analysis.\"   But such  an analysis  is\r\n\nonly  required   when  there   are  gaps  in   the  available\r\n\ninformation, and Zarrilli has shown no such uncertainty here.\r\n\nZarrilli   argued   that  the   1990-91   Final  Supplemental\r\n\nEnvironmental   Impact   Statement/Report  violated   federal\r\n\nregulations because  it was  not specific  enough.   But  the\r\n\napplicable regulations  do not require  agencies to  evaluate\r\n\nall   comments  exhaustively.     Another  acceptable  agency\r\n\nresponse is the one the defendants chose to make -- providing\r\n\nvalid reasons  for why Zarrilli's proposal did  not warrant a\r\n\ndetailed  response.   Finally, Zarrilli  complained that  the\r\n\ndefendants failed to publish his full proposal in the 1990-91\r\n\nFinal Supplemental Environmental  Impact Statement/Report  in\r\n\nviolation of NEPA Reg.   1503.4(b).   However, the regulation\r\n\nexplicitly  permits  summaries  of  exceptionally  voluminous\r\n\ncomments, and Zarrilli's proposal  certainly falls into  this\r\n\ncategory.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n</pre>",
