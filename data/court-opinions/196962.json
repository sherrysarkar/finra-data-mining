On  December  14,  1981, appellant  Paul\r                    Per  Curiam\r                               \r\n\nFerragamo (\"Ferragamo\")  was insured by United  Life and Accident\r\n\nInsurance  Company (\"United  Life\")  pursuant to  a policy  which\r\n\nentitled  Ferragamo to benefit payments in the event of his total\r\n\ndisability.2   At  that time  he  owned and  operated  Northshore\r\n\nRecycling, a scrap metal recycling business.  Shortly thereafter,\r\n\nFerragamo submitted  a claim for total  disability benefits based\r\n\non an  accident  suffered  while  at  work  which  caused  severe\r\n\ninjuries to his  left leg and ankle.  As  required by the policy,\r\n\nhe  proceeded  to  file  monthly reports  regarding  his  injury.\r\n\nRelying on  these reports  and the information  contained therein\r\n\nestablishing that Ferragamo remained totally disabled and was not\r\n\nworking for pay  or profit, appellee Chubb Life Insurance Company\r\n\nof  America (\"Chubb\"),  United Life's  successor,  paid Ferragamo\r\n\ntotal  disability benefits  of $2,400  per month from  April 1982\r\n\nuntil June 1993,3 as  well as social  insurance benefits of  $750\r\n\nper month  over the initial five year period of his claim.  Chubb\r\n\nalso  waived the further payment of premiums pursuant to a policy\r\n\nprovision.\r\n\n          Although   the   monthly  reports   requested  detailed\r\n\ninformation  from  Ferragamo regarding  the  nature  of any  work\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  We present the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's\r\nverdict.  See,  e.g., Coastal  Fuels of P.R.,  Inc. v.  Caribbean\r                                                                           \r\nPetroleum Corp., 79 F.3d  182, 186, petition for cert.  filed, 65\r                                                                       \r\nU.S.L.W. 3034 (July 2, 1996).\r\n\n3   The disputed period  is limited to  the period after  January\r\n1988.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nactivities,4 he continuously represented  that he was not working\r\n\nor earning  any income other  than \"investment income.\"5   During\r\n\nthe course of Ferragamo's  eleven- year claimed disability, Chubb\r\n\nattempted  to verify the nature of his disability in a variety of\r\n\nways including telephone contacts, personal interviews, reviewing\r\n\nhis income  tax returns, independent medical  evaluations, and by\r\n\n\"spot-checks\" of Ferragamo's activities by private investigators.\r\n\nThese  efforts  eventually  revealed that,  while  Ferragamo  was\r\n\nclaiming total  disability, he was actually  engaging in numerous\r\n\nand  varied  physical  and  work  activities,  including  playing\r\n\nracquetball with  his trial lawyer, signing  public records under\r\n\noath  to the  effect that  he  was working  as a  builder, filing\r\n\nfederal income tax  returns where  he stated under  oath that  he\r\n\nreceived  significant profits  from his  real  estate development\r\n\nbusiness,  operating a  construction company  known as  Ferragamo\r\n\nDevelopment which purchased, developed, and sold over $10,000,000\r\n\nin  real estate, and disclosing to various persons, including his\r\n\ndoctors, creditors, banks and various  town officers, that he was\r\n\na  self-employed real  estate  developer, contractor  or  builder\r\n\nearning from $100,000 to $250,000 per year.  To mention only some\r\n\nof  the   discovered  evidence,   Ferragamo  fully  developed   a\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  The inquiries included  questions regarding his occupation and\r\nduties, whether he was self-employed, whether he  had returned to\r\nwork on either  a part-time  or full-time basis,  what his  daily\r\nactivities consisted  of, the amount  of his monthly  income, and\r\nwhether he was partially or totally disabled.\r\n\n5   Ferragamo  signed each  report below  the statement  that: \"I\r\ncertify that  the foregoing  statements and answers  are complete\r\nand true to the best of my knowledge.\"\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n$6,000,000  condominium  complex  in  Swampscott,  Massachusetts,\r\n\nwhere he would be  at the job site  almost continuously each  day\r\n\nfrom 7:00-7:30 AM to 4:00-5:00 PM.  He not only drove his pick-up\r\n\ntruck  to  work, but  at times  operated  a front-end  loader and\r\n\nclimbed  down inside the newly dug foundation holes to check them\r\n\nout.   He was also fully  active in all aspects  of the planning,\r\n\nfinancing, supervision and sale of this project.\r\n\n          In addition  to the Swampscott condominium,  during the\r\n\ntime of  his alleged total  disability Ferragamo also  engaged in\r\n\nvarious land  transactions including  those involving a  340 acre\r\n\ntract in  Littleton, New  Hampshire, two  lots in  North Andover,\r\n\nMassachusetts, two  in Salem,  and others in  Lynnfield, Peabody,\r\n\nRevere, and Swampscott, as well as at Chuebeque Island, Maine.\r\n\n          Predictably  upon  learning  the  above,  Chubb stopped\r\n\ndisability payments  under the policy, and  incredibly, Ferragamo\r\n\nsued seeking  damages for breach of  contract, negligence, unfair\r\n\nand deceptive trade practices  pursuant to Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 93,\r\n\nnegligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  and  intentional\r\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.  Chubb denied these allegations\r\n\nand  counterclaimed   alleging   fraud,  deceit   and   negligent\r\n\nmisrepresentation.\r\n\n          A  trial  was  held  at  which  the  above  facts  were\r\n\npresented to the jury.   At the  close of plaintiff's case  Chubb\r\n\nmoved  for judgment pursuant to Fed. R.  Civ. P. 50, which motion\r\n\nwas denied by the  district court on all counts  except regarding\r\n\nChapter 93A, on   which ruling was reserved.   Thereafter, at the\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nclose of the  evidence, Chubb  renewed the Rule  50 motion,  with\r\n\nsimilar  results.   The  jury  found  for  Chubb  on  all  counts\r\n\nincluding on  Chubb's counterclaim in the  amount of $192,401.71.\r\n\nPursuant to special interrogatories the jury ruled that Chubb had\r\n\nnot  breached  the policy  contract,  that  Ferragamo engaged  in\r\n\nmisrepresentations  regarding his  claim, and that  after January\r\n\n1988, he  engaged in fraud in  this respect.   The district court\r\n\nthen dismissed Ferragamo's chapter 93A claim.\r\n\n          Ferragamo raised three issues on appeal which under the\r\n\ncircumstances  of this  case border  on the  frivolous:   (1) the\r\n\nadmission into evidence of the investigator's reports which Chubb\r\n\nrelied on in suspending Ferragamo's benefits; (2) the limiting of\r\n\nthe cross-examination of Chubb's expert; and (3) the instructions\r\n\ngiven  to  the  jury  regarding  the  deceit   count  of  Chubb's\r\n\ncounterclaim.\r\n\n          The challenged reports  were clearly admissible  within\r\n\nthe discretion of the trial court, see Sinai v. New England Tel &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nTel. Co., 3 F.3d 471, 475 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied,     U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n   , 115  S. Ct. 597  (1994), because  they were relevant  to the\r\n\nissue  of whether  Chubb had reasonably  investigated Ferragamo's\r\n\neligibility for  benefits before terminating them.   See Teishing\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. SER-Jobs For Progress, Inc., 19 F.3d 755, 762 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                        \r\n\nThis  question  was put  at  issue  not  only by  the  nature  of\r\n\nFerragamo's claim, but also  by the door that  was opened by  his\r\n\ncounsel  in  the direct  examination of  his own  expert witness.\r\n\nSinai,  3 F.3d at  475-76.  Furthermore,  considering the copious\r               \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nindependent  evidence heard  by  the  jury regarding  Ferragamo's\r\n\nactivities, any error committed is at best harmless.  See Almonte\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  National Union Fire  Ins. Co.,  787 F.2d  763, 771  (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1986).\r\n\n          A trial court's discretion in limiting the conduct of a\r\n\ntrial, although not limitless, is certainly ample enough to allow\r\n\nthe curbing of the cross-examination of  Chubb's expert under the\r\n\ncircumstances  of this trial.   See Fed. R.  Evid. 611(b) (noting\r                                             \r\n\nthat \"cross examination  should be limited to  the subject matter\r\n\nof direct  examination\").   On direct examination  Chubb's expert\r\n\ntestified regarding its insurance  practices in August 1993, when\r\n\nChubb  suspended   Ferragamo's  insurance  benefits.     He  also\r\n\ntestified regarding  the reasonableness of Chubb's  actions as to\r\n\nthe  period of time that  lapsed from the  time the investigative\r\n\nreports  were  received  to   the  suspension  of  the  benefits.\r\n\nFerragamo's lawyer extensively fished outside these waters before\r\n\nthe trial court properly ended the expedition.\r\n\n          Finally, in regard to the claim that the district court\r\n\nerred in  its jury instructions, it is  beyond reasonable dispute\r\n\nthat Ferragamo did not make these objections after the charge was\r\n\ngiven  but  before  the  jury  retired  to  deliberate.    It  is\r\n\nelementary that the failure  to object to a jury charge  after it\r\n\nis given and  before the jury retires to  deliberate, is fatal to\r\n\nany claim of  error on  appeal.  Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 51; Scarfo  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nCabletron  Sys., Inc., 54  F.3d 931, 940 (1st  Cir. 1995).  While\r                               \r\n\nthere  are extraordinary  exceptions  to this  black-letter rule,\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nsee, e.g., id., such  is not the present case.  Thus, we dwell no\r                        \r\n\nlonger on this or any other alleged error.\r\n\n          We  can perceive  no appealable  error by  the district\r\n\ncourt.  In fact  the record shows actions by  appellant for which\r\n\nhe could very well be held accountable before another forum.\r\n\nConsidering  the  totally   meritless  nature  of   this  appeal,\r\n\nappellant is hereby ordered to show cause within 10 days from the\r\n\nissuance of this decision why he should not be held to pay double\r\n\ncosts  and  attorney's fees  on  appeal.

Shortly thereafter, Ferragamo submitted a claim for total disability benefits based on an accident suffered while at work which caused severe injuries to his left leg and ankle.  As required by the policy, he proceeded to file monthly reports regarding his injury.  Relying on these reports and the information contained therein establishing that Ferragamo remained totally disabled and was not working for pay or profit, appellee Chubb Life Insurance Company of America (\"Chubb\"), United Life's successor, paid Ferragamo total disability benefits of $2,400 per month from April 1982 until June 1993,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> as well as social insurance benefits of $750 per month over the initial five year period of his claim.

These efforts eventually revealed that, while Ferragamo was claiming total disability, he was actually engaging in numerous and varied physical and work activities, including playing racquetball with his trial lawyer, signing public records under oath to the effect that he was working as a builder, filing federal income tax returns where he stated under oath that he received significant profits from his real estate development business, operating a construction company known as Ferragamo Development which purchased, developed, and sold over $10,000,000 in real estate, and disclosing to various persons, including his doctors, creditors, banks and various town officers, that he was a self-employed real estate developer, contractor or builder earning from $100,000 to $250,000 per year.  To mention only some of the discovered evidence, Ferragamo fully developed a $6,000,000 condominium complex in Swampscott, Massachusetts, where he would be at the job site almost continuously each day from 7:00-7:30 AM to 4:00-5:00 PM. He not only drove his pick-up truck to work, but at times operated a front-end loader and climbed down inside the newly dug foundation holes to check them out.

See Keisling v. SER-Jobs For Progress, Inc., 19 F.3d 755, 762 (1st Cir.1994).  This question was put at issue not only by the nature of Ferragamo's claim, but also by the door that was opened by his counsel in the direct examination of his own expert witness.  Sinai, 3 F.3d at 475-76.   Furthermore, considering the copious independent evidence heard by the jury regarding Ferragamo's activities, any error committed is at best harmless.  See Almonte v.

On direct examination Chubb's expert testified regarding its insurance practices in August 1993, when Chubb suspended Ferragamo's insurance benefits.  He also testified regarding the reasonableness of Chubb's actions as to the period of time that lapsed from the time the investigative reports were received to the suspension of the benefits.

It is elementary that the failure to object to a jury charge after it is given and before the jury retires to deliberate, is fatal to any claim of error on appeal.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 51;  Scarfo v.

Shortly thereafter, Ferragamo submitted a claim for total disability benefits based on an accident suffered while at work which caused severe injuries to his left leg and ankle.  As required by the policy, he proceeded to file monthly reports regarding his injury.  Relying on these reports and the information contained therein establishing that Ferragamo remained totally disabled and was not working for pay or profit, appellee Chubb Life Insurance Company of America (\"Chubb\"), United Life's successor, paid Ferragamo total disability benefits of $2,400 per month from April 1982 until June 1993,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> as well as social insurance benefits of $750 per month over the initial five year period of his claim.  Chubb also waived the further payment of premiums pursuant to a policy provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the monthly reports requested detailed information from Ferragamo regarding the nature of any work activities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> he continuously represented that he was not working or earning any income other than \"investment income.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  During the course of Ferragamo's eleven-year claimed disability, Chubb attempted to verify the nature of his disability in a variety of ways including telephone contacts, personal interviews, reviewing his income tax returns, independent medical evaluations, and by \"spot-checks\" of Ferragamo's activities by private investigators.  These efforts eventually revealed that, while Ferragamo was claiming total disability, he was actually engaging in numerous and varied physical and work activities, including playing racquetball with his trial lawyer, signing public records under oath to the effect that he was working as a builder, filing federal income tax returns where he stated under oath that he received significant profits from his real estate development business, operating a construction company known as Ferragamo Development which purchased, developed, and sold over $10,000,000 in real estate, and disclosing to various persons, including his doctors, creditors, banks and various town officers, that he was a self-employed real estate developer, contractor or builder earning from $100,000 to $250,000 per year.  To mention only some of the discovered evidence, Ferragamo fully developed a $6,000,000 condominium complex in Swampscott, Massachusetts, where he would be at the job site almost continuously each day from 7:00-7:30 AM to 4:00-5:00 PM. He not only drove his pick-up truck to work, but at times operated a front-end loader and climbed down inside the newly dug foundation holes to check them out.  He was also fully active in all aspects of the planning, financing, supervision and sale of this project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the Swampscott condominium, during the time of his alleged total disability Ferragamo also engaged in various land transactions including those involving a 340 acre tract in Littleton, New Hampshire, two lots in North Andover, Massachusetts, two in Salem, and others in Lynnfield, Peabody, Revere, and Swampscott, as well as at Chuebeque Island, Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Predictably upon learning the above, Chubb stopped disability payments under the policy, and incredibly, Ferragamo sued seeking damages for breach of contract, negligence, unfair and deceptive trade practices pursuant to Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 93, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Chubb denied these allegations and counterclaimed alleging fraud, deceit and negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial was held at which the above facts were presented to the jury.  At the close of plaintiff's case Chubb moved for judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50, which motion was denied by the district court on all counts except regarding Chapter 93A, on which ruling was reserved.  Thereafter, at the close of the evidence, Chubb renewed the Rule 50 motion, with similar results.  The jury found for Chubb on all counts including on Chubb's counterclaim in the amount of $192,401.71.  Pursuant to special interrogatories the jury ruled that Chubb had not breached the policy contract, that Ferragamo engaged in misrepresentations regarding his claim, and that after January 1988, he engaged in fraud in this respect.
