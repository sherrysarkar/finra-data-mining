Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Coffin and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     John M. Thompson, by appointment of the court, with whom\nTrevor Neverson, pro se ipso, was on brief, for appellant.\n     William J. Meade, Assistant Attorney General, Commonwealth\nof Massachusetts, with whom Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General,\nwas on brief, for appellee.\n     Brenda M. O'Malley, Attorney, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, U.S. Dep't of Justice, with whom David W. Ogden,\nActing Assistant Attorney General, and Terri J. Scadron, Senior\nLitigation Counsel, were on brief, for provisional respondent\n(Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service).\n\n\n                          August 20, 2001\n\f\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.           In 1987, a Hampden County,\n\nMassachusetts grand jury indicted petitioner-appellant Trevor\n\nNeverson, a native of Trinidad, for the murder of his fifteen-\n\nmonth-old    stepdaughter,      Leshawna    Wright.         His    first   trial\n\nresulted in a court-ordered judgment of acquittal as to so much\n\nof the indictment as alleged first-degree murder.                    The trial\n\njudge sent the remaining charges (second-degree murder and the\n\nlesser included offense of manslaughter) to the jury.                 The jury\n\ndeadlocked and the judge declared a mistrial.               The petitioner's\n\nsubsequent    attempts     to   terminate    the   case      on    grounds    of\n\nevidentiary insufficiency and double jeopardy were unavailing.\n\nSee   Neverson   v.   Commonwealth,   546     N.E.2d    876       (Mass.   1989)\n\n(affirming lower court rulings).\n\n            On retrial, a new jury found the petitioner guilty of\n\nmanslaughter.    The trial judge sentenced him to serve a lengthy\n\nprison term.      The conviction and sentence were affirmed on\n\nappeal.     See Commonwealth v. Neverson, 619 N.E.2d 344 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct.), rev. denied, 622 N.E.2d 1364 (Mass. 1993).\n\n            On August 28, 1996, the petitioner repaired to the\n\nfederal district court and filed an application for habeas\n\ncorpus relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (Petition No. 1).                        On\n\nDecember 24, 1996, the district court (O'Toole, J.) dismissed\n\nthe   petition   without    prejudice      because     it    contained      some\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\funexhausted claims.      See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 522 (1982)\n\n(holding that a federal habeas court ordinarily should not\n\nadjudicate    a     \"mixed\"   petition,     i.e.,      one   containing   both\n\nexhausted and unexhausted claims); Adelson v. DiPaola, 131 F.3d\n\n259, 261-62 (1st Cir. 1997) (same).             The petitioner initially\n\nfiled a notice of appeal, but apparently thought better of it\n\nand withdrew the appeal on September 3, 1997.\n\n            In the meantime, the petitioner moved for a new trial\n\nin the state court.       He filed his motion on July 11, 1997, but\n\nthe state trial judge denied it, and the petitioner's efforts to\n\noverturn that adverse ruling came to naught.                 See Commonwealth\n\nv.   Neverson,    699   N.E.2d   28   (Mass.    App.    Ct.)   (table),   rev.\n\ndenied, 700 N.E.2d 544 (Mass. 1998) (table).\n\n            On August 17, 1998, the petitioner returned to the\n\nfederal district court and filed the instant application for\n\nhabeas relief (Petition No. 2).                On October 13, 1998, the\n\nrespondent, a state correctional official, moved to dismiss the\n\npetition as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1).                         The\n\ndistrict    court    (Lindsay,    J.)   dismissed       Petition   No.    2    as\n\nuntimely.     The court simultaneously granted a certificate of\n\nappealability (COA), 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c), on two issues:                      (1)\n\nDoes the pendency in federal court of a prior dismissed habeas\n\npetition toll the statute of limitations for the purposes of a\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fsubsequent petition? (2) Does the filing of a subsequent habeas\n\npetition relate back to a prior petition which raised the same\n\nissues, but was dismissed without prejudice?                  The petitioner\n\npromptly perfected an appeal.\n\n          After an initial round of pro se briefing, we appointed\n\ncounsel and set a new briefing schedule.                At about the same\n\ntime, a new development occurred.          The petitioner had entered\n\nthe United States illegally in 1985.         In 1994, the Immigration\n\nand Naturalization Service (INS) sought to deport him for this\n\nillegal entry.        See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).             Three years\n\nlater,   the   INS   lodged   an    additional     charge     based   on   his\n\ncommission     of    an   aggravated      felony     (the       manslaughter\n\nconviction).        See id. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).             The necessary\n\nadministrative       proceedings      resulted     in     a     finding     of\n\ndeportability and a denial of the petitioner's applications for\n\nadjustment of status and/or waiver of deportability.\n\n          The petitioner completed his term of immurement on the\n\nmanslaughter conviction in the spring of 2000.                  Because the\n\ndeportation proceedings were still hanging fire, the INS took\n\nhim into custody.      On August 31, 2000, the petitioner asked us\n\nfor a stay of deportation.         We granted the stay temporarily and\n\nagreed, in effect, to treat the INS as a provisional respondent\n\nin the pending appeal, so that a nettlesome issue — whether\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fdeportation would moot the petitioner's habeas appeal — could be\n\nconsidered.        Expedited briefing on this issue followed.\n\n             Neverson's appeal was consolidated for oral argument\n\nwith a case containing a similar limitation issue, namely,\n\nDelaney v. Matesanz, No. 99-1972.                 We heard oral argument in\n\nboth cases on November 9, 2000.                 Four days later, the Supreme\n\nCourt granted certiorari to review the decision of the United\n\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Walker v.\n\nArtuz, 208 F.3d 357 (2d Cir. 2000),                     cert. granted sub nom.\n\nDuncan v. Walker, 121 S. Ct. 480 (2000).                     Because that case\n\nsquarely raised the question of whether 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)\n\n—   the    one-year       limitation     period    enacted       as   part   of   the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub. L.\n\nNo. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Apr. 24, 1996) — could be tolled by\n\nthe    pendency     of    federal   as     well    as    state    post-conviction\n\nproceedings, we stayed both Neverson's and Delaney's pending\n\nappeals.      The Supreme Court spoke on June 18, 2001, see Duncan\n\nv. Walker, 121 S. Ct. 2120 (2001), and we vacated the stay ten\n\ndays      later.     We    now   resolve       Neverson's    appeal     (reserving\n\nDelaney's case for treatment in a separate opinion).\n\n             As all parties recognize, the AEDPA applies to this\n\ncase.      Congress enacted that statute on April 24, 1996, in part\n\nto combat increasingly pervasive abuses of the federal courts'\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fhabeas    jurisdiction.     Felker     v.   Turpin,   518    U.S.    651,    664\n\n(1996).    Among other things, the AEDPA imposed, for the first\n\ntime, a limitation period applicable to state prisoners' habeas\n\napplications.1     According to this provision, \"[a] 1-year period\n\nof limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\n\nState    court.\"    28    U.S.C.   §   2244(d)(1).          This    period   of\n\nlimitation normally begins to accrue on \"the date on which the\n\n[state court] judgment became final by the conclusion of direct\n\nreview or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\"\n\nId. § 2244(d)(1)(A).2\n\n\n    1Prior to the passage of the AEDPA, a state prisoner's\nhabeas application could be dismissed on timeliness grounds only\nif the petitioner's delay had prejudiced the state's ability to\nrespond.   See Rule 9(a), 28 foll. § 2254; see also Richard H.\nFallon, Jr. et al., Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and\nthe Federal System 162 (4th ed. Supp. 1999).\n    2In limited circumstances, one of three other accrual dates\nmay apply, namely:\n\n    (B) the date on which the impediment to filing an\n    application created by State action in violation of\n    the Constitution or laws of the United States is\n    removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by\n    such State action; [or] (C) the date on which the\n    constitutional right asserted was initially recognized\n    by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly\n    recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively\n    applicable to cases on collateral review; or (D) the\n    date on which the factual predicate of the claim or\n    claims presented could have been discovered through\n    the exercise of due diligence.\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f            The petitioner's manslaughter conviction became final\n\nbefore     the    AEDPA's      effective         date.      In   respect    to    such\n\nconvictions, we have construed the AEDPA to encompass a one-year\n\ngrace period within which state prisoners may file federal\n\nhabeas petitions testing the constitutionality of convictions\n\nthat became final before the AEDPA's effective date.                       Gaskins v.\n\nDuval, 183 F.3d 8, 9 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam);                          see also\n\nDuncan,    121     S.    Ct.   at   2130    n.1     (Stevens,     J.,    concurring)\n\n(enumerating       cases       to   like    effect       from    other    circuits).\n\nAccordingly, the petitioner had until April 24, 1997 to file his\n\napplication for federal habeas relief.                   He docketed Petition No.\n\n1 within that time frame, but that petition was dismissed and he\n\nvoluntarily abandoned his appeal from the order of dismissal.\n\nHe did not propound Petition No. 2 until August 17, 1998 (over\n\na   year   after    the    grace     period       had    expired).       Hence,   that\n\npetition was time-barred, as the district court ruled, unless\n\nsome sufficiently excusatory circumstance existed.\n\n            The petitioner makes four efforts to salvage Petition\n\nNo.   2:         these    efforts     involve,           respectively,     statutory\n\ninterpretation, the Suspension Clause, \"relation back,\" and\n\nequitable tolling.          We address them in order.\n\n\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(B)-(D).                   None of these three scenarios\nexists here.\n\n                                           -8-\n\f             The    petitioner's   statutory   interpretation        argument\n\nimplicates 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2), which provides that \"[t]he\n\ntime during which a properly filed application for State post-\n\nconviction     or   other   collateral    review    with   respect    to    the\n\npertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted\n\ntoward   any    period   of   limitation    under    [section    2244(d)].\"\n\nAlthough this provision plainly tolls the limitation period from\n\nand after July 11, 1997 (the date upon which the petitioner\n\nmoved for a new trial in state court), the one-year grace period\n\nalready had expired by that date.          Without more, then, Petition\n\nNo. 2 was beyond the temporal pale.         See Fields v. Johnson, 159\n\nF.3d 914, 915-16 (5th Cir. 1998) (per curiam).\n\n             Seeking to avoid this pitfall, the petitioner contends\n\nthat the reference in section 2244(d)(2) to \"other collateral\n\nreview\" includes not only state collateral review proceedings\n\nbut   also     federal   habeas    proceedings.       Building       on    that\n\nfoundation, he argues that the pendency of Petition No. 1 tolled\n\nthe limitation period from the date of filing (August 28, 1996)\n\nto the date of the withdrawal of his notice of appeal (September\n\n3, 1997).      In his view, this hiatus, coupled with the tolling\n\nthat accompanied his pursuit of post-conviction remedies in the\n\nstate courts during the period from July 11, 1997 through July\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f27, 1998, rendered Petition No. 2 timeous (i.e., filed within\n\none year of April 24, 1996, after subtracting \"tolled\" periods).\n\n               We reject this argument.                  To the extent that the\n\npetitioner asks us to determine what Congress meant when it\n\nwrote     that       the     AEDPA's      limitation      period,      28     U.S.C.       §\n\n2244(d)(1), would be tolled while a state prisoner pursued\n\n\"State    post-conviction            or    other    collateral      review,\"        id.    §\n\n2244(d)(2), the Supreme Court has answered that question for us.\n\nIn Duncan, the Court made pellucid that the adjective \"State\"\n\nqualifies both of the phrases that follow.                   In the Court's view,\n\nsection 2244(d)(2)\n\n               protect[s] a state prisoner's ability later\n               to apply for federal habeas relief while\n               state remedies are being pursued.    At the\n               same time, the provision limits the harm to\n               the interest in finality by according\n               tolling effect only to \"properly filed\n               application[s] for State post-conviction or\n               other collateral review.\"\n\nDuncan,    121       S.    Ct.     at    2128    (emphasis    supplied)          (quoting\n\nstatute).            Thus,     section      2244(d)(2),      properly         construed,\n\n\"toll[s] the limitation period for the pursuit of state remedies\n\n[but]    not     during      the     pendency      of   applications      for     federal\n\nreview.\"       Id.\n\n               The    Duncan     Court's        bellwether   holding      —      that   \"an\n\napplication          for     federal      habeas    corpus    review        is    not     an\n\n'application         for     State      post-conviction      or   other       collateral\n\n                                            -10-\n\freview' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2),\" id. at\n\n2129    —    sounds   the   death     knell   for    the   petitioner's   main\n\nargument.      On this basis, we rule that the pendency of Petition\n\nNo. 1 did not toll the limitation period (and, therefore, did\n\nnot render Petition No. 2 timeous).\n\n             The petitioner's second effort to rescue Petition No.\n\n2 hinges on his argument that so restrictive an interpretation\n\nof     the   statutory      tolling    provision      renders   the   AEDPA's\n\nlimitation period unconstitutional under the Suspension Clause,\n\nU.S. Const. art. 1, § 9, cl. 2.          This argument is not foreclosed\n\nby Duncan, as it was not made to the Duncan Court.\n\n             We nonetheless do not reach the merits.               The AEDPA\n\nlimits the scope of habeas review, so that issues not included\n\nin a COA cannot be heard on appeal.                 Bui v. DiPaolo, 170 F.3d\n\n232, 236-37 (1st Cir. 1999).            Since the operative COA in this\n\ncase (the one granted by the district court) made no reference\n\nto the Suspension Clause issue, that issue is not properly\n\nbefore us.\n\n             The petitioner's third effort to salvage Petition No.\n\n2 rests on the notion that Petition No. 2 somehow \"relates back\"\n\nto Petition No. 1 (which was timely filed but dismissed without\n\nprejudice).      The \"relation back\" doctrine derives from Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 15(c) (stipulating, inter alia, that\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f\"[a]n amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the\n\noriginal pleading when . . . the claim . . . asserted in the\n\namended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or\n\noccurrence         set   forth    or    attempted   to   be   set    forth   in   the\n\noriginal pleading\").             Absent a specific savings clause, however,\n\na dismissal without prejudice leaves a habeas petitioner who\n\nasserts a \"relation-back\" claim — like any other plaintiff in a\n\ncivil action — in the same situation as if his first suit had\n\nnever been filed.             See Lefkowitz v. Fair, 816 F.2d 17, 21-24\n\n(1st Cir. 1987); see also Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Int'l\n\nAss'n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, 915 F.2d 43, 48 (1st\n\nCir.       1990)    (noting      that    the   effect    of   dismissal      without\n\nprejudice \"is to render the proceedings a nullity and leave the\n\nparties as if the action had never been brought\" (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n              In all events, Rule 15(c) simply does not apply where,\n\nas here, the party bringing suit did not seek to \"amend\" or\n\n\"supplement\" his original pleading, but, rather, opted to file\n\nan entirely new petition at a subsequent date.                      In short, there\n\nwas nothing to which Petition No. 2 could relate back. 3                          See\n\n\n       3\n      To be sure, the petitioner could have improved his position\nby requesting that the district court stay, rather than dismiss,\nPetition No. 1. See Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2130 (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring) (observing that \"there is no reason why a district\ncourt should not retain jurisdiction over a meritorious claim\n\n                                          -12-\n\fMarsh v. Soares, 223 F.3d 1217, 1219 (10th Cir. 2000) (holding\n\n\"relation    back\"    doctrine    inapplicable   when    initial    habeas\n\npetition had been dismissed because there was no pleading to\n\nwhich the new petition could relate back); Warren v. Garvin, 219\n\nF.3d 111, 114 (2d Cir. 2000) (same).\n\n            The petitioner's fourth effort to avoid the time bar\n\ndepends on the availability of equitable tolling.             This effort\n\nis less easily dispatched.         The concurring opinion in Duncan\n\nfurnishes support for the view that, in an appropriate case,\n\nequitable tolling may be available to ameliorate the rigors of\n\nsection 2244(d)(1).        There, Justice Stevens, writing for himself\n\nand Justice Souter, took the position that \"neither the Court's\n\nnarrow   holding     [in   Duncan],   nor   anything    in   the   text   or\n\nlegislative history of AEDPA, precludes a federal court from\n\ndeeming the limitations period tolled for such a petition as a\n\nmatter of equity.\"         Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2130 (Stevens, J.,\n\nconcurring).       The argument gains further momentum from pre-\n\nDuncan cases recognizing the theoretical possibility of tolling\n\n\n\nand stay further proceedings pending the complete exhaustion of\nstate remedies\"); see also Zarvela v. Artuz, 254 F.3d 374, 380\n(2d Cir. 2001); Freeman v. Page, 208 F.3d 572, 577 (7th Cir.\n2000); Calderon v. United States Dist. Ct., 134 F.3d 981, 986-87\n(9th Cir. 1998). Post-AEDPA, this will be the preferable course\nin many cases involving \"mixed\" petitions — and it may be the\nonly appropriate course in cases in which an outright dismissal\nthreatens to imperil the timeliness of a collateral attack.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fsection 2244(d)(1)'s one-year limitation period on equitable\n\ngrounds, e.g., Davis v. Johnson, 158 F.3d 806, 810 (5th Cir.\n\n1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1074 (1999), and from a post-\n\nDuncan case to the same effect, namely, Zarvela v. Artuz, 254\n\nF.3d 374, 379 (2d Cir. 2001).            We note too that some courts have\n\napplied equitable tolling in connection with the AEDPA's one-\n\nyear   time    limitation    on    the   filing   of   habeas    petitions   by\n\nfederal prisoners.        E.g., United States v. Marcello, 212 F.3d\n\n1005, 1010 (7th Cir.),        cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 188 (2000);\n\nSandvik v. United States, 177 F.3d 1269, 1271-72 (11th Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n              The petitioner, albeit inartfully, appears to have\n\npreserved his equitable tolling claim below, but the district\n\ncourt did not address it.          He has renewed that claim on appeal.\n\nGiven the lack of any findings on this potentially important\n\nissue, and the consequent lack of in-depth briefing, we believe\n\nthat the course of prudence is to remand this case for further\n\nconsideration in light of Duncan.              The district court may hold\n\nan evidentiary hearing if it sees fit, and may direct further\n\nbriefing.      If the court concludes that equitable tolling is\n\nunwarranted as a matter of fact, it should again dismiss the\n\npetition as time-barred.          If, however, the court determines that\n\nthe    petitioner   has     made    a    sufficient    showing    to   warrant\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fequitable tolling, it must then resolve the unanswered legal\n\nquestion:    Is equitable tolling available to extend the one-year\n\nlimitation period specified in section 2244(d)(1)?          We take no\n\nview on these, or any other, issues.\n\n            This leaves the stay of deportation question (which\n\nturns on whether deportation would moot or otherwise render\n\nnugatory the petitioner's habeas application).      There is now an\n\nadded complication:     on June 20, 2001, the petitioner, who has\n\nbeen detained by the INS for well over a year, moved for release\n\non bail.    In view of the fact that remand is required, we think\n\nit best to leave intact the provisional stay of deportation for\n\nthe time being, empowering the district court to inquire into\n\nthe mootness question and extend, modify, or dissolve the stay,\n\nas it deems appropriate.     Similarly, we do not act upon the bail\n\nmotion, but transfer that motion to the district court for\n\nfurther consideration.      In that regard, the court may wish to\n\nconsult the Supreme Court's recent opinion in Zadvydas v. Davis,\n\n121 S. Ct. 2491 (2001), for what guidance it may provide.\n\n            We need go no further.      For the reasons stated, we\n\nvacate the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent    with   this   opinion.    The   provisional     stay   of\n\ndeportation entered on September 8, 2000 shall remain in effect\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fpending   further   order   of   either   the   district   court   or,   if\n\nanother appeal ensues, this court.\n\n\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f",

His first trial resulted in a court-ordered judgment of acquittal as to so much of the indictment as alleged first-degree murder. The trial judge sent the remaining charges (second-degree murder and the lesser included offense of manslaughter) to the jury. The jury deadlocked and the judge declared a mistrial. The petitioner's subsequent attempts to terminate the case on grounds of evidentiary insufficiency and double jeopardy were unavailing. See Neverson v. Commonwealth, 546 N.E.2d 876 (Mass. 1989) (affirming lower court rulings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On retrial, a new jury found the petitioner guilty of manslaughter. The trial judge sentenced him to serve a lengthy prison term. The conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. See Commonwealth v. Neverson, 619 N.E.2d 344 (Mass. App. Ct.), rev. denied, 622 N.E.2d 1364 (Mass. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 28, 1996, the petitioner repaired to the federal district court and filed an application for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 (Petition No. 1). On December 24, 1996, the district court (O'Toole, J.) dismissed the petition without prejudice because it contained some unexhausted claims. See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 522 (1982) (holding that a federal habeas court ordinarily should not adjudicate a \"mixed\" petition, i.e., one containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims); Adelson v. DiPaola, 131 F.3d 259, 261-62 (1st Cir. 1997) (same). The petitioner initially filed a notice of appeal, but apparently thought better of it and withdrew the appeal on September 3, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, the petitioner moved for a new trial in the state court. He filed his motion on July 11, 1997, but the state trial judge denied it, and the petitioner's efforts to overturn that adverse ruling came to naught. See Commonwealth v. Neverson, 699 N.E.2d 28 (Mass. App. Ct.) (table), rev. denied, 700 N.E.2d 544 (Mass. 1998) (table).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 17, 1998, the petitioner returned to the federal district court and filed the instant application for habeas relief (Petition No. 2). On October 13, 1998, the respondent, a state correctional official, moved to dismiss the petition as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1). The district court (Lindsay, J.) dismissed Petition No. 2 as untimely. The court simultaneously granted a certificate of appealability (COA), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c), on two issues: (1) Does the pendency in federal court of a prior dismissed habeas petition toll the statute of limitations for the purposes of a subsequent petition? (2) Does the filing of a subsequent habeas petition relate back to a prior petition which raised the same issues, but was dismissed without prejudice? The petitioner promptly perfected an appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an initial round of pro se briefing, we appointed counsel and set a new briefing schedule. At about the same time, a new development occurred. The petitioner had entered the United States illegally in 1985. In 1994, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) sought to deport him for this illegal entry. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(B). Three years later, the INS lodged an additional charge based on his commission of an aggravated felony (the manslaughter conviction). See id. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The necessary administrative proceedings resulted in a finding of deportability and a denial of the petitioner's applications for adjustment of status and/or waiver of deportability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner completed his term of immurement on the manslaughter conviction in the spring of 2000. Because the deportation proceedings were still hanging fire, the INS took him into custody. On August 31, 2000, the petitioner asked us for a stay of deportation. We granted the stay temporarily and agreed, in effect, to treat the INS as a provisional respondent in the pending appeal, so that a nettlesome issue -- whether deportation would moot the petitioner's habeas appeal -- could be considered. Expedited briefing on this issue followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neverson's appeal was consolidated for oral argument with a case containing a similar limitation issue, namely, Delaney v. Matesanz, No. 99-1972. We heard oral argument in both cases on November 9, 2000. Four days later, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Walker v. Artuz, 208 F.3d 357 (2d Cir. 2000), cert. granted sub nom. Duncan v. Walker, 121 S. Ct. 480 (2000). Because that case squarely raised the question of whether 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1) -- the one-year limitation period enacted as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Apr. 24, 1996) -- could be tolled by the pendency of federal as well as state post-conviction proceedings, we stayed both Neverson's and Delaney's pending appeals. The Supreme Court spoke on June 18, 2001, see Duncan v. Walker, 121 S. Ct. 2120 (2001), and we vacated the stay ten days later. We now resolve Neverson's appeal (reserving Delaney's case for treatment in a separate opinion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As all parties recognize, the AEDPA applies to this case. Congress enacted that statute on April 24, 1996, in part to combat increasingly pervasive abuses of the federal courts' habeas jurisdiction. Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996). Among other things, the AEDPA imposed, for the first time, a limitation period applicable to state prisoners' habeas applications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> According to this provision, \"[a] 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1). This period of limitation normally begins to accrue on \"the date on which the [state court] judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" Id. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's manslaughter conviction became final before the AEDPA's effective date. In respect to such convictions, we have construed the AEDPA to encompass a one-year grace period within which state prisoners may file federal habeas petitions testing the constitutionality of convictions that became final before the AEDPA's effective date. Gaskins v. Duval, 183 F.3d 8, 9 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam); see also Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2130 n.1 (Stevens, J., concurring) (enumerating cases to like effect from other circuits). Accordingly, the petitioner had until April 24, 1997 to file his application for federal habeas relief. He docketed Petition No. 1 within that time frame, but that petition was dismissed and he voluntarily abandoned his appeal from the order of dismissal. He did not propound Petition No. 2 until August 17, 1998 (over a year after the grace period had expired). Hence, that petition was time-barred, as the district court ruled, unless some sufficiently excusatory circumstance existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner makes four efforts to salvage Petition No. 2: these efforts involve, respectively, statutory interpretation, the Suspension Clause, \"relation back,\" and equitable tolling. We address them in order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's statutory interpretation argument implicates 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2), which provides that \"[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under [section 2244(d)].\" Although this provision plainly tolls the limitation period from and after July 11, 1997 (the date upon which the petitioner moved for a new trial in state court), the one-year grace period already had expired by that date. Without more, then, Petition No. 2 was beyond the temporal pale. See Fields v. Johnson, 159 F.3d 914, 915-16 (5th Cir. 1998) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking to avoid this pitfall, the petitioner contends that the reference in section 2244(d)(2) to \"other collateral review\" includes not only state collateral review proceedings but also federal habeas proceedings. Building on that foundation, he argues that the pendency of Petition No. 1 tolled the limitation period from the date of filing (August 28, 1996) to the date of the withdrawal of his notice of appeal (September 3, 1997). In his view, this hiatus, coupled with the tolling that accompanied his pursuit of post-conviction remedies in the state courts during the period from July 11, 1997 through July 27, 1998, rendered Petition No. 2 timeous (i.e., filed within one year of April 24, 1996, after subtracting \"tolled\" periods).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument. To the extent that the petitioner asks us to determine what Congress meant when it wrote that the AEDPA's limitation period, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1), would be tolled while a state prisoner pursued \"State post-conviction or other collateral review,\" id. &#167; 2244(d)(2), the Supreme Court has answered that question for us. In Duncan, the Court made pellucid that the adjective \"State\" qualifies both of the phrases that follow. In the Court's view, section 2244(d)(2)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">protect[s] a state prisoner's ability later to apply for federal habeas relief while state remedies are being pursued. At the same time, the provision limits the harm to the interest in finality by according tolling effect only to \"properly filed application[s] for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2128 (emphasis supplied) (quoting statute). Thus, section 2244(d)(2), properly construed, \"toll[s] the limitation period for the pursuit of state remedies [but] not during the pendency of applications for federal review.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Duncan Court's bellwether holding -- that \"an application for federal habeas corpus review is not an 'application for State post-conviction or other collateral review' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2),\" id. at 2129 -- sounds the death knell for the petitioner's main argument. On this basis, we rule that the pendency of Petition No. 1 did not toll the limitation period (and, therefore, did not render Petition No. 2 timeous).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's second effort to rescue Petition No. 2 hinges on his argument that so restrictive an interpretation of the statutory tolling provision renders the AEDPA's limitation period unconstitutional under the Suspension Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &#167; 9, cl. 2. This argument is not foreclosed by Duncan, as it was not made to the Duncan Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We nonetheless do not reach the merits. The AEDPA limits the scope of habeas review, so that issues not included in a COA cannot be heard on appeal. Bui v. DiPaolo, 170 F.3d 232, 236-37 (1st Cir. 1999). Since the operative COA in this case (the one granted by the district court) made no reference to the Suspension Clause issue, that issue is not properly before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's third effort to salvage Petition No. 2 rests on the notion that Petition No. 2 somehow \"relates back\" to Petition No. 1 (which was timely filed but dismissed without prejudice). The \"relation back\" doctrine derives from Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) (stipulating, inter alia, that \"[a]n amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when . . . the claim . . . asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading\"). Absent a specific savings clause, however, a dismissal without prejudice leaves a habeas petitioner who asserts a \"relation-back\" claim -- like any other plaintiff in a civil action -- in the same situation as if his first suit had never been filed. See Lefkowitz v. Fair, 816 F.2d 17, 21-24 (1st Cir. 1987); see also Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Int'l Ass'n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, 915 F.2d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 1990) (noting that the effect of dismissal without prejudice \"is to render the proceedings a nullity and leave the parties as if the action had never been brought\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, Rule 15(c) simply does not apply where, as here, the party bringing suit did not seek to \"amend\" or \"supplement\" his original pleading, but, rather, opted to file an entirely new petition at a subsequent date. In short, there was nothing to which Petition No. 2 could relate back.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See Marsh v. Soares, 223 F.3d 1217, 1219 (10th Cir. 2000) (holding \"relation back\" doctrine inapplicable when initial habeas petition had been dismissed because there was no pleading to which the new petition could relate back); Warren v. Garvin, 219 F.3d 111, 114 (2d Cir. 2000) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's fourth effort to avoid the time bar depends on the availability of equitable tolling. This effort is less easily dispatched. The concurring opinion in Duncan furnishes support for the view that, in an appropriate case, equitable tolling may be available to ameliorate the rigors of section 2244(d)(1). There, Justice Stevens, writing for himself and Justice Souter, took the position that \"neither the Court's narrow holding [in Duncan], nor anything in the text or legislative history of AEDPA, precludes a federal court from deeming the limitations period tolled for such a petition as a matter of equity.\" Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2130 (Stevens, J., concurring). The argument gains further momentum from pre-Duncan cases recognizing the theoretical possibility of tolling section 2244(d)(1)'s one-year limitation period on equitable grounds, e.g., Davis v. Johnson, 158 F.3d 806, 810 (5th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1074 (1999), and from a post-Duncan case to the same effect, namely, Zarvela v. Artuz, 254 F.3d 374, 379 (2d Cir. 2001). We note too that some courts have applied equitable tolling in connection with the AEDPA's one-year time limitation on the filing of habeas petitions by federal prisoners. E.g., United States v. Marcello, 212 F.3d 1005, 1010 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 188 (2000); Sandvik v. United States, 177 F.3d 1269, 1271-72 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, albeit inartfully, appears to have preserved his equitable tolling claim below, but the district court did not address it. He has renewed that claim on appeal. Given the lack of any findings on this potentially important issue, and the consequent lack of in-depth briefing, we believe that the course of prudence is to remand this case for further consideration in light of Duncan. The district court may hold an evidentiary hearing if it sees fit, and may direct further briefing. If the court concludes that equitable tolling is unwarranted as a matter of fact, it should again dismiss the petition as time-barred. If, however, the court determines that the petitioner has made a sufficient showing to warrant equitable tolling, it must then resolve the unanswered legal question: Is equitable tolling available to extend the one-year limitation period specified in section 2244(d)(1)?

There is now an added complication: on June 20, 2001, the petitioner, who has been detained by the INS for well over a year, moved for release on bail. In view of the fact that remand is required, we think it best to leave intact the provisional stay of deportation for the time being, empowering the district court to inquire into the mootness question and extend, modify, or dissolve the stay, as it deems appropriate. Similarly, we do not act upon the bail motion, but transfer that motion to the district court for further consideration. In that regard, the court may wish to consult the Supreme Court's recent opinion in Zadvydas v. Davis, 121 S. Ct. 2491 (2001), for what guidance it may provide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

His first trial resulted in a court-ordered judgment of acquittal as to so much of the indictment as alleged first-degree murder. The trial judge sent the remaining charges (second-degree murder and the lesser included offense of manslaughter) to the jury. The jury deadlocked and the judge declared a mistrial. The petitioner's subsequent attempts to terminate the case on grounds of evidentiary insufficiency and double jeopardy were unavailing. See Neverson v.

On December 24, 1996, the district court (O'Toole, J.) dismissed the petition without prejudice because it contained some unexhausted claims. See Rose v.

He filed his motion on July 11, 1997, but the state trial judge denied it, and the petitioner's efforts to overturn that adverse ruling came to naught. See Commonwealth v.

On October 13, 1998, the respondent, a state correctional official, moved to dismiss the petition as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1). The district court (Lindsay, J.) dismissed Petition No. 2 as untimely. The court simultaneously granted a certificate of appealability (COA), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c), on two issues: (1) Does the pendency in federal court of a prior dismissed habeas petition toll the statute of limitations for the purposes of a subsequent petition? (2) Does the filing of a subsequent habeas petition relate back to a prior petition which raised the same issues, but was dismissed without prejudice? The petitioner promptly perfected an appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an initial round of pro se briefing, we appointed counsel and set a new briefing schedule. At about the same time, a new development occurred. The petitioner had entered the United States illegally in 1985. In 1994, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) sought to deport him for this illegal entry. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(B). Three years later, the INS lodged an additional charge based on his commission of an aggravated felony (the manslaughter conviction). See id. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The necessary administrative proceedings resulted in a finding of deportability and a denial of the petitioner's applications for adjustment of status and/or waiver of deportability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner completed his term of immurement on the manslaughter conviction in the spring of 2000. Because the deportation proceedings were still hanging fire, the INS took him into custody. On August 31, 2000, the petitioner asked us for a stay of deportation. We granted the stay temporarily and agreed, in effect, to treat the INS as a provisional respondent in the pending appeal, so that a nettlesome issue -- whether deportation would moot the petitioner's habeas appeal -- could be considered. Expedited briefing on this issue followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neverson's appeal was consolidated for oral argument with a case containing a similar limitation issue, namely, Delaney v. Matesanz, No. 99-1972. We heard oral argument in both cases on November 9, 2000. Four days later, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Walker v. Artuz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768207\"><a href=\"/opinion/768207/sherman-walker-v-christopher-artuz-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span> (2d Cir. 2000), cert. granted sub nom. Duncan v. Walker, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></span> (2000). Because that case squarely raised the question of whether 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1) -- the one-year limitation period enacted as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Apr. 24, 1996) -- could be tolled by the pendency of federal as well as state post-conviction proceedings, we stayed both Neverson's and Delaney's pending appeals. The Supreme Court spoke on June 18, 2001, see Duncan v. Walker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269282/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2120</span></a></span> (2001), and we vacated the stay ten days later. We now resolve Neverson's appeal (reserving Delaney's case for treatment in a separate opinion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As all parties recognize, the AEDPA applies to this case. Congress enacted that statute on April 24, 1996, in part to combat increasingly pervasive abuses of the federal courts' habeas jurisdiction. Felker v. Turpin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118058\"><a href=\"/opinion/118058/felker-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 664 (1996). Among other things, the AEDPA imposed, for the first time, a limitation period applicable to state prisoners' habeas applications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> According to this provision, \"[a] 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1). This period of limitation normally begins to accrue on \"the date on which the [state court] judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" Id. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's manslaughter conviction became final before the AEDPA's effective date. In respect to such convictions, we have construed the AEDPA to encompass a one-year grace period within which state prisoners may file federal habeas petitions testing the constitutionality of convictions that became final before the AEDPA's effective date. Gaskins v. Duval, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198545\"><a href=\"/opinion/198545/gaskins-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam); see also Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2130 n.1 (Stevens, J., concurring) (enumerating cases to like effect from other circuits). Accordingly, the petitioner had until April 24, 1997 to file his application for federal habeas relief. He docketed Petition No. 1 within that time frame, but that petition was dismissed and he voluntarily abandoned his appeal from the order of dismissal. He did not propound Petition No. 2 until August 17, 1998 (over a year after the grace period had expired). Hence, that petition was time-barred, as the district court ruled, unless some sufficiently excusatory circumstance existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner makes four efforts to salvage Petition No. 2: these efforts involve, respectively, statutory interpretation, the Suspension Clause, \"relation back,\" and equitable tolling. We address them in order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's statutory interpretation argument implicates 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2), which provides that \"[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under [section 2244(d)].\" Although this provision plainly tolls the limitation period from and after July 11, 1997 (the date upon which the petitioner moved for a new trial in state court), the one-year grace period already had expired by that date. Without more, then, Petition No. 2 was beyond the temporal pale. See Fields v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"16152\"><a href=\"/opinion/16152/fields-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 915-16 (5th Cir. 1998) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking to avoid this pitfall, the petitioner contends that the reference in section 2244(d)(2) to \"other collateral review\" includes not only state collateral review proceedings but also federal habeas proceedings. Building on that foundation, he argues that the pendency of Petition No. 1 tolled the limitation period from the date of filing (August 28, 1996) to the date of the withdrawal of his notice of appeal (September 3, 1997). In his view, this hiatus, coupled with the tolling that accompanied his pursuit of post-conviction remedies in the state courts during the period from July 11, 1997 through July 27, 1998, rendered Petition No. 2 timeous (i.e., filed within one year of April 24, 1996, after subtracting \"tolled\" periods).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument. To the extent that the petitioner asks us to determine what Congress meant when it wrote that the AEDPA's limitation period, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1), would be tolled while a state prisoner pursued \"State post-conviction or other collateral review,\" id. &#167; 2244(d)(2), the Supreme Court has answered that question for us. In Duncan, the Court made pellucid that the adjective \"State\" qualifies both of the phrases that follow. In the Court's view, section 2244(d)(2)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">protect[s] a state prisoner's ability later to apply for federal habeas relief while state remedies are being pursued. At the same time, the provision limits the harm to the interest in finality by according tolling effect only to \"properly filed application[s] for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2128 (emphasis supplied) (quoting statute). Thus, section 2244(d)(2), properly construed, \"toll[s] the limitation period for the pursuit of state remedies [but] not during the pendency of applications for federal review.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Duncan Court's bellwether holding -- that \"an application for federal habeas corpus review is not an 'application for State post-conviction or other collateral review' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2),\" id. at 2129 -- sounds the death knell for the petitioner's main argument. On this basis, we rule that the pendency of Petition No. 1 did not toll the limitation period (and, therefore, did not render Petition No. 2 timeous).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's second effort to rescue Petition No. 2 hinges on his argument that so restrictive an interpretation of the statutory tolling provision renders the AEDPA's limitation period unconstitutional under the Suspension Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &#167; 9, cl. 2. This argument is not foreclosed by Duncan, as it was not made to the Duncan Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We nonetheless do not reach the merits. The AEDPA limits the scope of habeas review, so that issues not included in a COA cannot be heard on appeal. Bui v. DiPaolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198376\"><a href=\"/opinion/198376/bui-v-dipaolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 236-37 (1st Cir. 1999). Since the operative COA in this case (the one granted by the district court) made no reference to the Suspension Clause issue, that issue is not properly before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's third effort to salvage Petition No. 2 rests on the notion that Petition No. 2 somehow \"relates back\" to Petition No. 1 (which was timely filed but dismissed without prejudice). The \"relation back\" doctrine derives from Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) (stipulating, inter alia, that \"[a]n amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when . . . the claim . . . asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading\"). Absent a specific savings clause, however, a dismissal without prejudice leaves a habeas petitioner who asserts a \"relation-back\" claim -- like any other plaintiff in a civil action -- in the same situation as if his first suit had never been filed. See Lefkowitz v. Fair, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486539\"><a href=\"/opinion/486539/alan-lefkowitz-v-michael-fair-commissioner-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21-24 (1st Cir. 1987); see also Nat'l R.R.

In short, there was nothing to which Petition No. 2 could relate back.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See Marsh v. Soares, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160144\"><a href=\"/opinion/160144/marsh-v-soares/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1217</span></a></span>, 1219 (10th Cir. 2000) (holding \"relation back\" doctrine inapplicable when initial habeas petition had been dismissed because there was no pleading to which the new petition could relate back); Warren v.

This effort is less easily dispatched. The concurring opinion in Duncan furnishes support for the view that, in an appropriate case, equitable tolling may be available to ameliorate the rigors of section 2244(d)(1). There, Justice Stevens, writing for himself and Justice Souter, took the position that \"neither the Court's narrow holding [in Duncan], nor anything in the text or legislative history of AEDPA, precludes a federal court from deeming the limitations period tolled for such a petition as a matter of equity.\" Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2130 (Stevens, J., concurring). The argument gains further momentum from pre-Duncan cases recognizing the theoretical possibility of tolling section 2244(d)(1)'s one-year limitation period on equitable grounds, e.g., Davis v.

We note too that some courts have applied equitable tolling in connection with the AEDPA's one-year time limitation on the filing of habeas petitions by federal prisoners. E.g., United States v. Marcello, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768747\"><a href=\"/opinion/768747/united-states-v-james-marcello-and-anthony-zizzo/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span>, 1010 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></span> (2000); Sandvik v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73810\"><a href=\"/opinion/73810/sandvik-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1269</span></a></span>, 1271-72 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, albeit inartfully, appears to have preserved his equitable tolling claim below, but the district court did not address it. He has renewed that claim on appeal. Given the lack of any findings on this potentially important issue, and the consequent lack of in-depth briefing, we believe that the course of prudence is to remand this case for further consideration in light of Duncan. The district court may hold an evidentiary hearing if it sees fit, and may direct further briefing. If the court concludes that equitable tolling is unwarranted as a matter of fact, it should again dismiss the petition as time-barred. If, however, the court determines that the petitioner has made a sufficient showing to warrant equitable tolling, it must then resolve the unanswered legal question: Is equitable tolling available to extend the one-year limitation period specified in section 2244(d)(1)? We take no view on these, or any other, issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the stay of deportation question (which turns on whether deportation would moot or otherwise render nugatory the petitioner's habeas application). There is now an added complication: on June 20, 2001, the petitioner, who has been detained by the INS for well over a year, moved for release on bail. In view of the fact that remand is required, we think it best to leave intact the provisional stay of deportation for the time being, empowering the district court to inquire into the mootness question and extend, modify, or dissolve the stay, as it deems appropriate. Similarly, we do not act upon the bail motion, but transfer that motion to the district court for further consideration. In that regard, the court may wish to consult the Supreme Court's recent opinion in Zadvydas v. Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2491</span></a></span> (2001), for what guidance it may provide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons stated, we vacate the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The provisional stay of deportation entered on September 8, 2000 shall remain in effect pending further order of either the district court or, if another appeal ensues, this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Prior to the passage of the AEDPA, a state prisoner's habeas application could be dismissed on timeliness grounds only if the petitioner's delay had prejudiced the state's ability to respond. See Rule 9(a), 28 foll. &#167; 2254; see also Richard H. Fallon, Jr. et al., Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 162 (4th ed. Supp. 1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In limited circumstances, one of three other accrual dates may apply, namely:</p>\n        <p>(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such State action; [or] (C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or (D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</p>\n        <p>28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(B)-(D). None of these three scenarios exists here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the petitioner could have improved his position by requesting that the district court stay, rather than dismiss, Petition No. 1. See Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2130 (Stevens, J., concurring) (observing that \"there is no reason why a district court should not retain jurisdiction over a meritorious claim and stay further proceedings pending the complete exhaustion of state remedies\"); see also Zarvela v. Artuz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773711\"><a href=\"/opinion/773711/victor-zarvela-v-christopher-artuz-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 380 (2d Cir. 2001); Freeman v. Page, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768230\"><a href=\"/opinion/768230/willie-freeman-v-james-h-page-warden-stateville-correctional-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span>, 577 (7th Cir. 2000); Calderon v.

Post-AEDPA, this will be the preferable course in many cases involving \"mixed\" petitions -- and it may be the only appropriate course in cases in which an outright dismissal threatens to imperil the timeliness of a collateral attack.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
