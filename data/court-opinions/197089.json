This  appeal is\r                                                      \r\n\nfrom a civil action brought against the Postmaster General in\r\n\nthe United States  District Court for the  District of Puerto\r\n\nRico by  Roman-Martinez, a  former postal employee.   Shortly\r\n\nafter ceasing to work for the Postal Service,  Roman-Martinez\r\n\ncomplained administratively to the Postal Service that, while\r\n\nemployed, he  had been  discriminated against because  of his\r\n\nhandicap in violation of  his rights under The Rehabilitation\r\n\nAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C.   794 et seq. (1985).  After pursuing,\r                                                \r\n\nwithout  success, the  prescribed  course  of  administrative\r\n\nremedies  within  the Postal  Service  and  before the  Equal\r\n\nEmployment  Opportunity   Commission  (EEOC),  Roman-Martinez\r\n\ninstituted the current de  novo judicial action under section\r                                           \r\n\n717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  \r\n\n2000e-16(c)  (1994).    The  district court  entered  summary\r\n\njudgment  for the  Postmaster  General and  refused to  allow\r\n\nRoman-Martinez to file an amended complaint.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          Roman-Martinez  was  honorably discharged  from the\r\n\nUnited  States Army  in  1981.   The Veterans  Administration\r\n\nfound that he had  a ten percent service-connected disability\r\n\nbased upon hepatitis and a  ten percent disability based upon\r\n\nlumbar  sprain.   In 1987,  he went  to  work for  the Postal\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nService under the  disabled veterans' preference  provisions,\r\n\nsee 5 U.S.C.    3309, 3313(2)(A) (1996).\r               \r\n\n          Initially employed  as a  labor custodian     a job\r\n\nwhich  Roman-Martinez alleges  was unsuitable because  he was\r\n\nunfit to do  heavy lifting and carrying     he soon  became a\r\n\ndistribution  clerk.   However, Roman-Martinez  contends that\r\n\nhis  new  supervisor's  refusal   to  assign  him  light-duty\r\n\nfunctions  caused him to injure his back.\r\n\n          A medical  examiner  for the  Postal Service  found\r\n\nthat  Roman-Martinez was  unable to  carry anything  over ten\r\n\npounds, placed him on limited duty and recommended that he be\r\n\ntransferred to Ponc , near  his home.  The transfer  to Ponc \r\n\ntook place in January of 1988.\r\n\n          About the  same time, Roman-Martinez filed  a claim\r\n\nfor workers' compensation  with the United States  Department\r\n\nof  Labor.   The  Postal  Service  opposed  the  granting  of\r\n\nworkers'  compensation,  denying  that Roman-Martinez's  back\r\n\ninjury  had been  work related.   On  February 16,  1988, his\r\n\nclaim was initially disallowed for lack of supporting medical\r\n\ndata.   That same day, Roman-Martinez,  having aggravated his\r\n\nback  injury,  saw  a doctor  who  found  him  to be  totally\r\n\ndisabled.\r\n\n          A few  days  later, Roman-Martinez  confronted  his\r\n\nsupervisor,  Bernie Sprolito,  with  the letter  denying  his\r\n\nworkers'  compensation claim.  Sprolito allegedly told Roman-\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nMartinez that he had  to surrender whatever had been  paid to\r\n\nhim under  the claim, and that,  notwithstanding Dr. Martin's\r\n\nmedical report indicating total  disability, he had to return\r\n\nto work or face discharge for absenteeism.\r\n\n          As  a  result  of his  conversation  with Sprolito,\r\n\nRoman-Martinez continued to work at the Ponc  office although\r\n\nallegedly suffering from  severe pain.  He also began feeling\r\n\npersecuted and harassed by Postal  Service employees, causing\r\n\nhim, he says, to become mentally ill.  \r\n\n          Following an appeal,  the United States  Department\r\n\nof Labor reopened Roman-Martinez's workers' compensation case\r\n\nand,  on June 13, 1988,  determined that his  back injury had\r\n\nbeen work related.\r\n\n          In mid-1989, he was  found to have a schizophrenic-\r\n\ntype  disorder  and   was  treated  with  psychotherapy   and\r\n\nantipsychotic agents.  A  psychiatrist described him as being\r\n\nsuspicious, hostile and agitated.  \r\n\n          Roman-Martinez's  bargaining  agent,  the  American\r\n\nPostal  Workers Union  (APWU),  filed two  grievances on  his\r\n\nbehalf.  In one, the APWU alleged that the Postal Service had\r\n\nviolated the collective bargaining agreement by assigning him\r\n\nfewer hours than other part-time flexible employees.  In  the\r\n\nother, the APWU claimed that the Postal Service had failed to\r\n\nplace  him on the clerk's seniority list at the Ponc  office.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nThe  APWU  and the  Postal  Service  settled both  grievances\r\n\nshortly thereafter.  \r\n\n          In June of 1990, Roman-Martinez stopped working for\r\n\nthe Postal  Service altogether, asserting that  he had become\r\n\ntotally incapacitated.\r\n\n          Not  fully satisfied  with  the  settlement of  his\r\n\ngrievances,  Roman-Martinez  contacted a  Postal  Service EEO\r\n\ncounsellor on September 24, 1990, and argued  that the Postal\r\n\nService's refusal  to give him  a full complement  of working\r\n\nhours  and to  place him  on the  clerk's seniority  list had\r\n\nconstituted discrimination  on  the  basis  of  his  physical\r\n\ndisability.   On November 7,  1990, he filed  with the Postal\r\n\nService   a   formal   administrative   complaint   of   such\r\n\ndiscrimination.   In a final decision dated May 14, 1991, the\r\n\nPostal   Service  rejected   Roman-Martinez's  administrative\r\n\ncomplaint  on the ground, among others, that he had failed to\r\n\nbring the allegedly discriminatory act to the attention of an\r\n\nEqual Employment  Opportunity (EEO) counsellor  within thirty\r\n\ndays  of   its  occurrence,  as  required   by  the  relevant\r\n\nregulation, 29 C.F.R.   1613.214(a)(1)(i) (1995).\r\n\n          Roman-Martinez appealed to the EEOC from the Postal\r\n\nService's ruling.   The EEOC, in  January 1992, affirmed  the\r\n\nPostal  Service's  determination that  Roman-Martinez's claim\r\n\nwas untimely because of his failure to have brought it to the\r\n\nattention of  an EEO counselor within  the thirty-day period.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nThe EEOC  thereafter denied a request  from Roman-Martinez to\r\n\nreopen its decision.  \r\n\n          On July 2, 1992, Roman-Martinez, his wife and their\r\n\nconjugal partnership brought this civil action pro se in  the\r                                                                 \r\n\nUnited  States  District Court  for  the  District of  Puerto\r\n\nRico.1   After the district  court had appointed  counsel, 42\r\n\nU.S.C.      2000e-5(f)(1)  (1994),  Roman-Martinez  filed  an\r\n\namended complaint in mid-April 1993.  \r\n\n          In  1995,  the  district  court  entered  an  order\r\n\ngranting   the  Postmaster   General's  motion   for  summary\r\n\njudgment, and dismissing Roman-Martinez's  amended complaint.\r\n\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          The  parties seem  to  agree, as  do  we, that  the\r\n\nstatutory basis  for Roman-Martinez's  action is 42  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2000e-16(c) (1994).  Such an action confers  upon the federal\r\n\ncomplainant the same  right to a trial de  novo as is enjoyed\r                                                           \r\n\nby private  sector and  state government employees  under the\r\n\namended Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Chandler v. Roudebush, 425\r                                                                    \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  complaint  includes Torres-Correa,  Roman-Martinez's\r\nwife, and  their conjugal  partnership as plaintiffs.   There\r\nis, however,  no indication in the  record that Torres-Correa\r\nwas  an employee of the  Postal Service, or  an applicant for\r\nsuch  employment.     They   were,  therefore,  outside   the\r\ncategories of persons  authorized to  sue under  42 U.S.C.   \r\n2000e-16(c) (1994),  which appears to be  the statutory basis\r\nfor Roman-Martinez's current suit.  \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nU.S. 840 (1976).  A district court does not  simply engage in\r\n\n\"substantial evidence\"  review, or  the like, based  upon the\r\n\nadministrative record.  Id. at 858,  863.  On the other hand,\r                                       \r\n\nas a  prerequisite to de novo trial  in the district court, a\r                                         \r\n\nfederal employee must first have exhausted the administrative\r\n\nremedies provided.

(1985), prohibits  discrimination against any  otherwise\r                \r\n\nqualified handicapped  individual solely by reason  of his or\r\n\nher handicap.2   The  Act incorporates the  rights, remedies,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  29 U.S.C.   794 (1985) provides:  \"No otherwise qualified\r\nhandicapped  individual  in  the United  States  . . . shall,\r\nsolely  by  reason of  his  handicap,  be excluded  from  the\r\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits  of, or be subjected\r\nto  discrimination under  any program  or activity  receiving\r\nFederal financial assistance or under any program or activity\r\nconducted by  any Executive  agency or  by the United  States\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nand procedures set forth  in the Equal Employment Opportunity\r\n\nAct.  See Civil Rights Act of 1964, Sections 717, 706(f)-(k),\r                     \r\n\n42 U.S.C.    2000e-16, 2000e-5 (f)-(k) (1994).\r\n\n          Section  717  of Title  VII  does not  set  out the\r\n\nprocedures, nor  does it prescribe a  limitations period, for\r\n\nthe filing of grievances by a federal employee affected by an\r\n\nalleged  unlawful  practice.   But  it  grants  to  the  EEOC\r\n\nauthority  to  \"issue  such  rules, regulations,  orders  and\r\n\ninstructions as  it deems necessary and  appropriate to carry\r\n\nout its responsibilities  under this section.\"   42 U.S.C.   \r\n\n2000e-16(b)  (1994).   Pursuant to  this authority,  the EEOC\r\n\nissued regulations published in  29 C.F.R.   1613.214 (1995),\r\n\nwhich provided, in part:3\r\n\n          (a)   Time Limits.  (1)  . . . The agency\r\n          may accept the  complaint for  processing\r\n          . . . only if: \r\n          (i)  The  complainant   brought  to   the\r\n          attention   of   the   Equal   Employment\r\n          Opportunity Counsellor the matter causing\r\n          him/her  to  believe   he/she  had   been\r\n          discriminated against  within 30 calendar\r\n          days   of  the   date   of  the   alleged\r\n          discriminatory event,  the effective date\r\n          of  an  alleged discriminatory  personnel\r\n          action,  or the  date that  the aggrieved\r\n          person  knew  or  reasonably should  have\r\n          known  of  the  discriminatory  event  or\r\n          personnel action; . . . \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nPostal Service . . . \"\r\n\n3.  The   quoted  regulations   were  applicable   to  Roman-\r\nMartinez's  administrative  complaints  made  in  1990.    In\r\nregulations effective in 1992,  the period for contacting the\r\nEEO counsellor  was extended from 30 to 45 days.  29 C.F.R.  \r\n1614.105(a)(1) (1995).\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\n          (4)  The  agency  shall extend  the  time\r\n          limits   in   this   section   when   the\r\n          complainant  shows  that  he/she was  not\r\n          notified of  the time limits  and was not\r\n          otherwise aware of them, was prevented by\r\n          circumstances  beyond  the  complainant's\r\n          control from submitting the matter within\r\n          the time  limits;  or for  other  reasons\r\n          considered sufficient by the agency.\r\n\n          The  Postal Service  and the  EEOC both  found that\r\n\nRoman-Martinez had failed to  bring \"the matter causing [him]\r\n\nto  believe  [he]  had  been discriminated  against\"  to  the\r\n\nattention of  the Postal Service's EEO  counsellor within the\r\n\nthirty-day period prescribed in the above regulation.  On the\r\n\nthen undisputed  assumption that  he had first  presented his\r\n\ncomplaints to EEO counsellor L pez on September 24, 1990, the\r\n\nPostal Service  and the EEOC determined  that presentation on\r\n\nthat  date was  plainly  too late.    As Roman-Martinez  had,\r\n\nindeed,  ceased to  work for  the Postal  Service  during the\r\n\nprevious  June  1990, the  effective  date  of the  personnel\r\n\nactions  he  challenged     the refusal  to  give him  a full\r\n\ncomplement of working hours and to place him on the seniority\r\n\nlist     would seem  necessarily to have  occurred more  than\r\n\nthirty days before the September 24 meeting.  \r\n\n          Agreeing   that  Roman-Martinez   had  indisputably\r\n\nfailed to meet the thirty-day requirement, the district court\r\n\nheld  that he  was  barred from  proceeding  with this  civil\r\n\naction.   The  court based  its ruling  on precedent  in this\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\ncircuit, and elsewhere, that  a federal employee's failure to\r\n\ncontact an  EEO counsellor  within the thirty-day  period, or\r\n\nsome   valid  extension   allowed   under  the   above-quoted\r\n\nregulations, causes him to  lose his right to pursue  a later\r\n\nde novo action in court.

Alleged  Invalidity  of  Regulation   Requiring  Federal\r                                                                         \r\n     Employees to  Bring Complaint  to EEO  Counsellor within\r                                                                         \r\n     Thirty Days\r                            \r\n\n          Roman-Martinez   argues   that  requiring   federal\r\n\nemployees  to  consult  with their  agency's  EEO  counsellor\r\n\nwithin  thirty days  forces  compliance with  time limits  so\r\n\nunreasonably  short  as  to  violate the  statutory  mandate.\r\n\nCongress's intent, he says, was to provide federal employees,\r\n\nwhen victimized by discrimination, with remedies identical to\r\n\nthose of state, municipal and private employees.  The latter,\r\n\nhe points out, are  allowed 180 days within  which to file  a\r\n\ncomplaint before the EEOC.  42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(e)(1) (1994).\r\n\n          Congress,  however,  refrained  from  legislatively\r\n\nsubjecting federal employees to the six-month period provided\r\n\nfor  other sorts of employees.   Rather, it  delegated to the\r\n\nEEOC  the authority  to  regulate the  bringing of  claims by\r\n\nfederal  employees.  The thirty-day regulation forces federal\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nemployees  to  try to  conciliate  their  grievances promptly\r\n\nbefore  seeking more formal  administrative relief within the\r\n\nagency and  before the EEOC.   Unlike the  180-day provision,\r\n\nthe thirty days  is not  the period within  which the  formal\r\n\ncomplaint  must be  filed, but  rather is  the period  within\r\n\nwhich  the grievance must be presented  for conciliation.  If\r\n\nthat  fails, a  further brief  period for  filing  the formal\r\n\ncomplaint  is   afforded.    In  any   case,  the  challenged\r\n\nprocedures  for federal employees  were in  continuous effect\r\n\nfor nearly twenty years before appellant's claim arose.4  The\r\n\nthirty-day time limit has  been accepted and enforced without\r\n\ncriticism  in  cases  litigated  before  the  lowewr  federal\r\n\ncourts, including this one.   See, e.g., Jensen, 912  F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n520.  We note, also, that  the Supreme Court has applied time\r\n\nlimitations  of equal duration to  the ones at  issue in this\r\n\ncase.  See  Irwin v. Dept. of  Veterans Affairs, 498  U.S. 89\r                                                           \r\n\n(1990)  (applying the pre-1991  thirty-day limitations period\r\n\nfor filing Title VII  civil actions); Brown, 425 U.S.  at 820\r                                                       \r\n\n(same).  Had  Congress wished to  tie federal employees  into\r\n\nthe 180  days established for other  categories of claimants,\r\n\nit could  easily have done  so.  And,  of course, it  remains\r\n\nopen to Congress at any time, should it so wish, to legislate\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Throughout this period, the time for federal employees to\r\npresent their  claims for counselling  was 30  days or  less.\r\nCompare 5 C.F.R.    713.214(a)(1)(i) (1972) with 29  C.F.R.  \r                                                            \r\n1613.214(a)(1)(i) (1992).\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\ntime limits different from those established by the EEOC.  We\r\n\nsee  no   justification  for  us  to   override  these  well-\r\n\nestablished   procedures  set   by   the  EEOC   pursuant  to\r\n\ncongressional authority.\r\n\n          Nor  can we  see  anything so  unreasonable in  the\r\n\nrelevant EEOC regulations as  to violate the equal protection\r\n\nclause  of  the  federal   Constitution  or  to  violate  the\r\n\nrequirements  of  due  process.    Congress  often  regulates\r\n\nfederal  employees  differently   from  other  categories  of\r\n\npersons; there  is nothing grossly unfair  or arbitrary about\r\n\nthe  challenged  regulations.    We  accordingly  uphold  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's rejection  of  appellant's  attack  on  the\r\n\nvalidity of the time limits in question.\r\n\n2.   Roman-Martinez's Contention that He Earlier Brought this\r                                                                         \r\n     Claim to the EEO Counsellor's Attention\r                                                        \r\n\n          When  Roman-Martinez sued  in  district  court,  he\r\n\nasserted there, for the first time, that he had contacted EEO\r\n\ncounsellor  L pez  prior to  September  24,  1990, hence  had\r\n\ncomplied with the thirty-day requirement.  Before considering\r\n\nthis contention, we examine the administrative record.  \r\n\n          The  EEOC, in  its initial  administrative decision\r\n\nreviewing  the Postal Service's rejection of Roman-Martinez's\r\n\nclaims,  upheld  the  Postal  Service's  conclusion  that  by\r\n\nwaiting until  September 24, 1990,  Roman-Martinez had failed\r\n\ntimely  to seek  EEO counselling.   Roman-Martinez thereafter\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nasked the EEOC  to reconsider that  decision, tendering as  a\r\n\njustification  for his delay  a psychiatrist's statement that\r\n\non  September  24, 1990,  the  \"high  levels of  neuroleptic,\r\n\nanxiolitics, antidepressive medications\"  prescribed for  his\r\n\nmental  disorder \"limited  almost completely\"  his functional\r\n\nlevel.\r\n\n          The EEOC  declined to  reopen the  case.  It  noted\r\n\nthat  while  appellant  complained  that   the  EEOC's  prior\r\n\ndecision involved  an  erroneous interpretation  of  law,  he\r\n\npresented no arguments at all to support that allegation, and\r\n\n\"has not even addressed the substance of the EEOC's appellate\r\n\ndecision.\"  The psychiatrist's statement itself was held \"not\r\n\nnew because it  was available and  could have been  presented\r\n\nwhen  appellant  initially  appealed\"   to  the  EEOC.    The\r\n\nstatement  did  not,  furthermore,  address  Roman-Martinez's\r\n\nability   to  have  sought   timely  EEO  counselling  before\r\n\nSeptember 24, 1990.\r\n\n          In  opposing summary  judgment before  the district\r\n\ncourt, Roman-Martinez did not renew the above contention that\r\n\nhis  failure  to  seek   EEO  counselling  earlier  had  been\r\n\njustified because of the  medications provided for his mental\r\n\ncondition.  Instead, he raised an issue not presented  during\r\n\nthe administrative  proceedings, namely, that he  had in fact\r\n\nsought EEO  counselling prior  to the untimely  September 24,\r\n\n1990, meeting.\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\n          In an affidavit filed in the district court action,\r\n\nRoman-Martinez asserted that he had contacted  EEO counsellor\r\n\nL pez \"twice  via telephone prior  to September 24,  1990, at\r\n\nsome  period of time between  October 1989 and  June 1990, to\r\n\ncommunicate the  discrimination I  was being subjected  to at\r\n\nthe  Ponc   Post Office  by  Postmaster  Oscar Rivera,  among\r\n\nothers.\"  The affidavit went on to report that \"L pez told me\r\n\nthat she would  speak to  Oscar Rivera to  see what could  be\r\n\ndone about  the situation.\"   Roman-Martinez now  claims that\r\n\nthis  new contention raises a  factual issue on  which he was\r\n\nentitled to have a trial in the district court.\r\n\n          The district  court rejected the  above contention.\r\n\nCiting  Theard v. United States  Army, 653 F.  Supp. 536, 541\r                                                 \r\n\n(M.D.N.C. 1987),  the court ruled that  plaintiff's affidavit\r\n\nfailed  to establish  that sufficient  facts were  brought to\r\n\nL pez's  attention  \"such  that  the  counsellor should  have\r\n\nreasonably  concluded  that  the  employee  was  seeking   to\r\n\nresolve,   through    EEO   channels,   an    allegation   of\r\n\ndiscrimination.\"    The  court   noted  the  absence  of  any\r\n\nreference  in the  alleged  phone discussions  with L pez  to\r\n\nspecific personnel actions.  \r\n\n          We are  inclined to  agree with the  district court\r\n\nthat  Roman-Martinez's affidavit was  insufficiently clear to\r\n\ncreate  a genuine  issue  of fact  over  whether he  made  an\r\n\nadequate presentation to an EEO counsellor prior to September\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\n24,   1990.     Except  for   saying  he   communicated  \"the\r\n\ndiscrimination I  was being  subjected to at  the Ponc   Post\r\n\nOffice  by  Postmaster  Oscar  Rivera,\"  appellant  does  not\r\n\ndescribe  the nature of what  he told L pez.   Other evidence\r\n\nindicates   that  during   this  period   Roman-Martinez  was\r\n\nprotesting, among others, the alleged violations of the union\r\n\ncontract and  the denial of his  workers' compensation claim,\r\n\nleaving it unclear if in  the alleged conversations with  the\r\n\nPostal  Service's   EEO  counsellor  Roman-Martinez   made  a\r\n\nrecognizable   claim   of  handicap   discrimination.     The\r\n\ncounsellor denied  having received  any such claims  prior to\r\n\nSeptember  24,  and  even   when  appellant's  affidavit   is\r\n\ninterpreted  in  a light  most  favorable  to appellant,  the\r\n\nsubstance  of   the  claims   actually  conveyed   cannot  be\r\n\nascertained.\r\n\n          But  while, therefore, the  district court may well\r\n\nbe right  that Roman-Martinez's affidavit did  not suffice to\r\n\nraise a genuine issue of fact, we do not decide on that basis\r\n\nalone.  Even supposing the affidavit were adequate to raise a\r\n\nfactual issue, there is the additional problem, also noted by\r\n\nthe  district  court,  that  Roman-Martinez  never  took  the\r\n\nposition  before the Postal Service  or the EEOC  that he had\r\n\npresented  his claim  of  handicap discrimination  to an  EEO\r\n\ncounsellor  prior  to September  24,  1990.   Throughout  the\r\n\nadministrative proceedings, the apparently  unchallenged date\r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\nof his first presentation to an  EEO counsellor was September\r\n\n24,  1990.   Far from  questioning this  date, Roman-Martinez\r\n\nsought  to  justify  his  failure to  have  acted  sooner  by\r\n\npresenting   a  psychiatrist's  letter  stating  that,  being\r\n\nheavily  medicated on  September  24,  1990,  his  functional\r\n\nlevels were \"limited almost completely.\"  The EEOC refused to\r\n\nreopen in order  to consider this  evidence, saying that  the\r\n\npsychiatrist's  statement  was  not  material  to  claimant's\r\n\nability  to have  sought timely  counselling in  the relevant\r\n\nearlier periods,  and anyway  came too late.   Roman-Martinez\r\n\nthereupon  abandoned  this contention  when  he  sued in  the\r\n\ndistrict  court.  He did not  mention it in his opposition to\r\n\nthe  motion  for summary  judgment  nor in  his  statement of\r\n\ncontroverted facts.  Rather, for  the first time, he asserted\r\n\nthe  new  and  different  proposition that  he  had  actually\r\n\npresented  his claim  of  handicap discrimination  to an  EEO\r\n\ncounsellor  prior to  September  24, 1990,  during  telephone\r\n\ncalls allegedly  made between October  1989 and June  1990 to\r\n\nEEO counsellor L pez.\r\n\n          We  agree  with  the  district  court  that  Roman-\r\n\nMartinez, having never presented it during the administrative\r\n\nproceedings,  may not  raise this  new factual  contention in\r\n\ncourt  proceedings for  the  first time.    To be  sure,  the\r\n\nexhaustion  requirement  should  be applied  with  reasonable\r\n\nrestraint where Congress has conferred the right to a de novo\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -16-\r\r\n\ntrial.   Nonetheless,  the  Supreme Court  has described  the\r\n\npresent   statutory   scheme   as   \"a   careful   blend   of\r\n\nadministrative and judicial enforcement powers.\"  Brown,  425\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. at  833.   The  lower federal  courts have  consistently\r\n\nfound a duty in  proceedings of this character to  pursue and\r\n\nexhaust administrative  remedies prior to the  de novo trial.\r                                                                  \r\n\nJensen, 912 F.2d at 520; McGuinness, 744 F.2d at 1320.  We do\r                                               \r\n\nnot  think that appellant may, for the first time, present to\r\n\na judicial fact finder a  key factual issue which he did  not\r\n\nraise during prior agency proceedings and which, indeed, runs\r\n\ncounter to assumptions  (i.e. the September 24 date)  that he\r\n\nseemingly accepted throughout the agency proceedings.\r\n\n          We  hold,  therefore,   that  the  district   court\r\n\nproperly  refused  to  consider   Roman-Martinez's  new-found\r\n\nassertion  of having  sought  EEO counselling  at an  earlier\r\n\ntime.     That   argument  was   not  exhausted   before  the\r\n\nadministrative tribunals having jurisdiction to  grant relief\r\n\nto appellant.\r\n\n          For the same and  additional reasons, the  district\r\n\ncourt  properly rejected  Roman-Martinez's assertion  that he\r\n\nhad  timely  presented  his  claims because  he  had  earlier\r\n\nrelayed them  to Bernie Sprolito, his  supervisor and manager\r\n\nof the People with Handicap Program at the Ponc  Post Office.\r\n\nNot only was this contention not brought up during the course\r\n\nof the administrative proceedings, but it also falls short of\r\n\n                             -17-\r\r\n\ndemonstrating,  even  if proven,  timely compliance  with the\r\n\nthirty-day  requirement.   Bernie  Sprolito was  not the  EEO\r\n\ncounsellor,  nor  did  appellant  present  any  evidence that\r\n\nBernie Sprolito was  ever held out  to him as  being the  EEO\r\n\ncounsellor.   See Jensen,  912 F.2d  at 521  (appellant \"must\r                                    \r\n\nallege and prove . . . that  the employer actively misled him\r\n\nand that he relied on the misconduct to his detriment\").  Nor\r\n\nhas appellant asserted that he  lacked notice of the  correct\r\n\nprocedures and time limits.  We find nothing in the reference\r\n\nto  the  conversations  with  Bernie  Sprolito  that  excuses\r\n\nnoncompliance with the thirty-day time limit.\r\n\n3.   Dismissal of Amended Complaint\r                                               \r\n\n          Roman-Martinez argues that the district court erred\r\n\nin dismissing his amended complaint.  The district court held\r\n\nthat  the amended  complaint  would not  survive a  motion to\r\n\ndismiss for  failure to exhaust administrative  remedies.  We\r\n\nhold that the court was correct.\r\n\n          The Supreme Court held in Forman v. Davis, 371 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n178, 182 (1962), that a party ought ordinarily to be given an\r\n\nopportunity  to test his claim  on the merits.   However, the\r\n\nCourt also noted  exceptions to this rule  as where prejudice\r\n\nto  the  amending party's  adversary  is shown  or  where the\r\n\nproposed  amendment would  constitute no  more than  a futile\r\n\nexercise.

New\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -18-\r\r\n\nHampshire Democratic Party, 821 F.2d 31,  34 (1st Cir. 1987).\r                                      \r\n\nThe latter exception applies here.\r\n\n          Roman-Martinez  filed  his   formal  complaint   of\r\n\ndiscrimination on November 7, 1990.  On December 7, 1990, the\r\n\nPostal Service  sent him a  letter outlining the  issues that\r\n\nthe investigation would cover, and inviting him to respond if\r\n\nhe disagreed with  the scope of the investigation.  Appellant\r\n\nresponded in a letter dated December 13,  1990, setting forth\r\n\nten allegations  of discrimination  dating back to  his first\r\n\nyear with  the Postal Service.   Of these,  most were new  to\r\n\nthose presented  in  the  original  complaint,  although  the\r\n\nlatter were also listed.\r\n\n          If he wished to  pursue the new allegations, Roman-\r\n\nMartinez was  required to  initiate a new  complaint covering\r\n\nthem.  He filed  a second, informal, administrative complaint\r\n\ndoing  so,  but never  got around  to  filing and  pursuing a\r\n\nformal administrative complaint incorporating the  new items.\r\n\nInstead,   without  ever   having  taken  steps   to  achieve\r\n\nadministrative  redress, he waited and eventually transferred\r\n\nthe contents  of the stillborn administrative  complaint into\r\n\nhis amended judicial complaint.\r\n\n          On these facts, it was clear to the district  court\r\n\nthat  the  new  items  inserted  into  the  amended  judicial\r\n\ncomplaint were  not only untimely because  (like the original\r\n\nitems   discussed  above)  they  dealt  with  incidents  that\r\n\n                             -19-\r\r\n\noccurred well  before the  appellant's first contact  with an\r\n\nEEO counsellor, but were unripe for adjudication because they\r\n\nwere  never  made  the  subject of  a  formal  administrative\r\n\ncomplaint  and proceedings.   To  hold otherwise  would allow\r\n\nappellant to circumvent the exhaustion requirement imposed on\r\n\nall who  bring claims  of handicap discrimination  in federal\r\n\ncourt.  See Jensen, 912 F.2d at 520.

Shortly after ceasing to work for the Postal Service, Roman-Martinez complained administratively to the Postal Service that, while employed, he had been discriminated against because of his handicap in violation of his rights under The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794 et seq.  (1985).  After pursuing, without success, the prescribed course of administrative remedies within the Postal Service and before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Roman-Martinez instituted the current de novo judicial action under section 717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-16(c) (1994).  The district court entered summary judgment for the Postmaster General and refused to allow Roman-Martinez to file an amended complaint.  We affirm.I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roman-Martinez was honorably discharged from the United States Army in 1981.  The Veterans Administration found that he had a ten percent service-connected disability based upon hepatitis and a ten percent disability based upon lumbar sprain.  In 1987, he went to work for the Postal Service under the disabled veterans' preference provisions, see 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3309, 3313(2)(A) (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially employed as a labor custodian--a job which Roman-Martinez alleges was unsuitable because he was unfit to do heavy lifting and carrying--he soon became a distribution clerk.  However, Roman-Martinez contends that his new supervisor's refusal to assign him light-duty functions caused him to injure his back.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A medical examiner for the Postal Service found that Roman-Martinez was unable to carry anything over ten pounds, placed him on limited duty and recommended that he be transferred to Ponce, near his home.  The transfer to Ponce took place in January of 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About the same time, Roman-Martinez filed a claim for workers' compensation with the United States Department of Labor.  The Postal Service opposed the granting of workers' compensation, denying that Roman-Martinez's back injury had been work related.  On February 16, 1988, his claim was initially disallowed for lack of supporting medical data.  That same day, Roman-Martinez, having aggravated his back injury, saw a doctor who found him to be totally disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days later, Roman-Martinez confronted his supervisor, Bernie Sprolito, with the letter denying his workers' compensation claim.  Sprolito allegedly told Roman-Martinez that he had to surrender whatever had been paid to him under the claim, and that, notwithstanding Dr. Martin's medical report indicating total disability, he had to return to work or face discharge for absenteeism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of his conversation with Sprolito, Roman-Martinez continued to work at the Ponce office although allegedly suffering from severe pain.  He also began feeling persecuted and harassed by Postal Service employees, causing him, he says, to become mentally ill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following an appeal, the United States Department of Labor reopened Roman-Martinez's workers' compensation case and, on June 13, 1988, determined that his back injury had been work related.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-1989, he was found to have a schizophrenic-type disorder and was treated with psychotherapy and antipsychotic agents.  A psychiatrist described him as being suspicious, hostile and agitated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roman-Martinez's bargaining agent, the American Postal Workers Union (APWU), filed two grievances on his behalf.  In one, the APWU alleged that the Postal Service had violated the collective bargaining agreement by assigning him fewer hours than other part-time flexible employees.  In the other, the APWU claimed that the Postal Service had failed to place him on the clerk's seniority list at the Ponce office.  The APWU and the Postal Service settled both grievances shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 1990, Roman-Martinez stopped working for the Postal Service altogether, asserting that he had become totally incapacitated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not fully satisfied with the settlement of his grievances, Roman-Martinez contacted a Postal Service EEO counsellor on September 24, 1990, and argued that the Postal Service's refusal to give him a full complement of working hours and to place him on the clerk's seniority list had constituted discrimination on the basis of his physical disability.  On November 7, 1990, he filed with the Postal Service a formal administrative complaint of such discrimination.  In a final decision dated May 14, 1991, the Postal Service rejected Roman-Martinez's administrative complaint on the ground, among others, that he had failed to bring the allegedly discriminatory act to the attention of an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counsellor within thirty days of its occurrence, as required by the relevant regulation, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1613.214(a)(1)(i) (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roman-Martinez appealed to the EEOC from the Postal Service's ruling.  The EEOC, in January 1992, affirmed the Postal Service's determination that Roman-Martinez's claim was untimely because of his failure to have brought it to the attention of an EEO counselor within the thirty-day period.  The EEOC thereafter denied a request from Roman-Martinez to reopen its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 2, 1992, Roman-Martinez, his wife and their conjugal partnership brought this civil action pro se in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After the district court had appointed counsel, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f)(1) (1994), Roman-Martinez filed an amended complaint in mid-April 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, the district court entered an order granting the Postmaster General's motion for summary judgment, and dismissing Roman-Martinez's amended complaint.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties seem to agree, as do we, that the statutory basis for Roman-Martinez's action is 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-16(c) (1994).  Such an action confers upon the federal complainant the same right to a trial de novo as is enjoyed by private sector and state government employees under the amended Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Chandler v. Roudebush, 425 U.S. 840, 96 S.Ct. 1949, 48 L.Ed.2d 416 (1976).  A district court does not simply engage in \"substantial evidence\" review, or the like, based upon the administrative record.  Id. at 858, 863, 96 S.Ct. at 1958, 1960-61.   On the other hand, as a prerequisite to de novo trial in the district court, a federal employee must first have exhausted the administrative remedies provided.  See Brown v. General Serv.  Admin., 425 U.S. 820, 832, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 1967-68, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976);  Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 520 (1st Cir.1990);  see, e.g., McGuinness v. United States Postal Serv., 744 F.2d 1318, 1320 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court granted the defendants summary judgment, a determination we review de novo, scrutinizing the entire record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, and indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.  Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794 et seq.  (1985), prohibits discrimination against any otherwise qualified handicapped individual solely by reason of his or her handicap.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Act incorporates the rights, remedies, and procedures set forth in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act.  See Civil Rights Act of 1964, Sections 717, 706(f)-(k), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e-16, 2000e-5 (f)-(k) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 717 of Title VII does not set out the procedures, nor does it prescribe a limitations period, for the filing of grievances by a federal employee affected by an alleged unlawful practice.  But it grants to the EEOC authority to \"issue such rules, regulations, orders and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities under this section.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-16(b) (1994).  Pursuant to this authority, the EEOC issued regulations published in 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1613.214 (1995), which provided, in part:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(a) Time Limits.  (1) ... The agency may accept the complaint for processing ... only if:(i) The complainant brought to the attention of the Equal Employment Opportunity Counsellor the matter causing him/her to believe he/she had been discriminated against within 30 calendar days of the date of the alleged discriminatory event, the effective date of an alleged discriminatory personnel action, or the date that the aggrieved person knew or reasonably should have known of the discriminatory event or personnel action;  ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(4) The agency shall extend the time limits in this section when the complainant shows that he/she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, was prevented by circumstances beyond the complainant's control from submitting the matter within the time limits;  or for other reasons considered sufficient by the agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Postal Service and the EEOC both found that Roman-Martinez had failed to bring \"the matter causing [him] to believe [he] had been discriminated against\" to the attention of the Postal Service's EEO counsellor within the thirty-day period prescribed in the above regulation.  On the then undisputed assumption that he had first presented his complaints to EEO counsellor Lpez on September 24, 1990, the Postal Service and the EEOC determined that presentation on that date was plainly too late.  As Roman-Martinez had, indeed, ceased to work for the Postal Service during the previous June 1990, the effective date of the personnel actions he challenged--the refusal to give him a full complement of working hours and to place him on the seniority list--would seem necessarily to have occurred more than thirty days before the September 24 meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agreeing that Roman-Martinez had indisputably failed to meet the thirty-day requirement, the district court held that he was barred from proceeding with this civil action.  The court based its ruling on precedent in this circuit, and elsewhere, that a federal employee's failure to contact an EEO counsellor within the thirty-day period, or some valid extension allowed under the above-quoted regulations, causes him to lose his right to pursue a later de novo action in court.  Jensen, 912 F.2d at 520;  Johnson v. United States Treasury Dept., 27 F.3d 415, 416 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal Roman-Martinez raises several points which we now discuss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>1. Alleged Invalidity of Regulation Requiring Federal Employees to Bring Complaint to EEO Counsellor within Thirty Days</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roman-Martinez argues that requiring federal employees to consult with their agency's EEO counsellor within thirty days forces compliance with time limits so unreasonably short as to violate the statutory mandate.  Congress's intent, he says, was to provide federal employees, when victimized by discrimination, with remedies identical to those of state, municipal and private employees.  The latter, he points out, are allowed 180 days within which to file a complaint before the EEOC. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress, however, refrained from legislatively subjecting federal employees to the six-month period provided for other sorts of employees.  Rather, it delegated to the EEOC the authority to regulate the bringing of claims by federal employees.  The thirty-day regulation forces federal employees to try to conciliate their grievances promptly before seeking more formal administrative relief within the agency and before the EEOC.  Unlike the 180-day provision, the thirty days is not the period within which the formal complaint must be filed, but rather is the period within which the grievance must be presented for conciliation.  If that fails, a further brief period for filing the formal complaint is afforded.  In any case, the challenged procedures for federal employees were in continuous effect for nearly twenty years before appellant's claim arose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The thirty-day time limit has been accepted and enforced without criticism in cases litigated before the lower federal courts, including this one.  See, e.g., Jensen, 912 F.2d at 520.   We note, also, that the Supreme Court has applied time limitations of equal duration to the ones at issue in this case.  See Irwin v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990) (applying the pre-1991 thirty-day limitations period for filing Title VII civil actions);  Brown, 425 U.S. at 820, 96 S.Ct. at 1961-62 (same).  Had Congress wished to tie federal employees into the 180 days established for other categories of claimants, it could easily have done so.  And, of course, it remains open to Congress at any time, should it so wish, to legislate time limits different from those established by the EEOC.  We see no justification for us to override these well-established procedures set by the EEOC pursuant to congressional authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can we see anything so unreasonable in the relevant EEOC regulations as to violate the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution or to violate the requirements of due process.  Congress often regulates federal employees differently from other categories of persons;  there is nothing grossly unfair or arbitrary about the challenged regulations.  We accordingly uphold the district court's rejection of appellant's attack on the validity of the time limits in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>2. Roman-Martinez's Contention that He Earlier Brought this Claim to the EEO Counsellor's Attention</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Roman-Martinez sued in district court, he asserted there, for the first time, that he had contacted EEO counsellor Lpez prior to September 24, 1990, hence had complied with the thirty-day requirement.  Before considering this contention, we examine the administrative record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC, in its initial administrative decision reviewing the Postal Service's rejection of Roman-Martinez's claims, upheld the Postal Service's conclusion that by waiting until September 24, 1990, Roman-Martinez had failed timely to seek EEO counselling.  Roman-Martinez thereafter asked the EEOC to reconsider that decision, tendering as a justification for his delay a psychiatrist's statement that on September 24, 1990, the \"high levels of neuroleptic, anxiolitics, antidepressive medications\" prescribed for his mental disorder \"limited almost completely\" his functional level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC declined to reopen the case.  It noted that while appellant complained that the EEOC's prior decision involved an erroneous interpretation of law, he presented no arguments at all to support that allegation, and \"has not even addressed the substance of the EEOC's appellate decision.\"   The psychiatrist's statement itself was held \"not new because it was available and could have been presented when appellant initially appealed\" to the EEOC.  The statement did not, furthermore, address Roman-Martinez's ability to have sought timely EEO counselling before September 24, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In opposing summary judgment before the district court, Roman-Martinez did not renew the above contention that his failure to seek EEO counselling earlier had been justified because of the medications provided for his mental condition.  Instead, he raised an issue not presented during the administrative proceedings, namely, that he had in fact sought EEO counselling prior to the untimely September 24, 1990, meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an affidavit filed in the district court action, Roman-Martinez asserted that he had contacted EEO counsellor Lpez \"twice via telephone prior to September 24, 1990, at some period of time between October 1989 and June 1990, to communicate the discrimination I was being subjected to at the Ponce Post Office by Postmaster Oscar Rivera, among others.\"   The affidavit went on to report that \"Lpez told me that she would speak to Oscar Rivera to see what could be done about the situation.\"   Roman-Martinez now claims that this new contention raises a factual issue on which he was entitled to have a trial in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the above contention.  Citing Theard v. United States Army, 653 F.Supp. 536, 541 (M.D.N.C.1987), the court ruled that plaintiff's affidavit failed to establish that sufficient facts were brought to Lpez's attention \"such that the counsellor should have reasonably concluded that the employee was seeking to resolve, through EEO channels, an allegation of discrimination.\"   The court noted the absence of any reference in the alleged phone discussions with Lpez to specific personnel actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are inclined to agree with the district court that Roman-Martinez's affidavit was insufficiently clear to create a genuine issue of fact over whether he made an adequate presentation to an EEO counsellor prior to September 24, 1990.  Except for saying he communicated \"the discrimination I was being subjected to at the Ponce Post Office by Postmaster Oscar Rivera,\" appellant does not describe the nature of what he told Lpez.  Other evidence indicates that during this period Roman-Martinez was protesting, among others, the alleged violations of the union contract and the denial of his workers' compensation claim, leaving it unclear if in the alleged conversations with the Postal Service's EEO counsellor Roman-Martinez made a recognizable claim of handicap discrimination.  The counsellor denied having received any such claims prior to September 24, and even when appellant's affidavit is interpreted in a light most favorable to appellant, the substance of the claims actually conveyed cannot be ascertained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But while, therefore, the district court may well be right that Roman-Martinez's affidavit did not suffice to raise a genuine issue of fact, we do not decide on that basis alone.  Even supposing the affidavit were adequate to raise a factual issue, there is the additional problem, also noted by the district court, that Roman-Martinez never took the position before the Postal Service or the EEOC that he had presented his claim of handicap discrimination to an EEO counsellor prior to September 24, 1990.  Throughout the administrative proceedings, the apparently unchallenged date of his first presentation to an EEO counsellor was September 24, 1990.  Far from questioning this date, Roman-Martinez sought to justify his failure to have acted sooner by presenting a psychiatrist's letter stating that, being heavily medicated on September 24, 1990, his functional levels were \"limited almost completely.\"   The EEOC refused to reopen in order to consider this evidence, saying that the psychiatrist's statement was not material to claimant's ability to have sought timely counselling in the relevant earlier periods, and anyway came too late.  Roman-Martinez thereupon abandoned this contention when he sued in the district court.  He did not mention it in his opposition to the motion for summary judgment nor in his statement of controverted facts.  Rather, for the first time, he asserted the new and different proposition that he had actually presented his claim of handicap discrimination to an EEO counsellor prior to September 24, 1990, during telephone calls allegedly made between October 1989 and June 1990 to EEO counsellor Lpez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that Roman-Martinez, having never presented it during the administrative proceedings, may not raise this new factual contention in court proceedings for the first time.  To be sure, the exhaustion requirement should be applied with reasonable restraint where Congress has conferred the right to a de novo trial.  Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has described the present statutory scheme as \"a careful blend of administrative and judicial enforcement powers.\"  Brown, 425 U.S. at 833, 96 S.Ct. at 1968.   The lower federal courts have consistently found a duty in proceedings of this character to pursue and exhaust administrative remedies prior to the de novo trial.  Jensen, 912 F.2d at 520;  McGuinness, 744 F.2d at 1320.   We do not think that appellant may, for the first time, present to a judicial fact finder a key factual issue which he did not raise during prior agency proceedings and which, indeed, runs counter to assumptions (i.e. the September 24 date) that he seemingly accepted throughout the agency proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that the district court properly refused to consider Roman-Martinez's new-found assertion of having sought EEO counselling at an earlier time.  That argument was not exhausted before the administrative tribunals having jurisdiction to grant relief to appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same and additional reasons, the district court properly rejected Roman-Martinez's assertion that he had timely presented his claims because he had earlier relayed them to Bernie Sprolito, his supervisor and manager of the People with Handicap Program at the Ponce Post Office.  Not only was this contention not brought up during the course of the administrative proceedings, but it also falls short of demonstrating, even if proven, timely compliance with the thirty-day requirement.  Bernie Sprolito was not the EEO counsellor, nor did appellant present any evidence that Bernie Sprolito was ever held out to him as being the EEO counsellor.  See Jensen, 912 F.2d at 521 (appellant \"must allege and prove ... that the employer actively misled him and that he relied on the misconduct to his detriment\").  Nor has appellant asserted that he lacked notice of the correct procedures and time limits.

Dismissal of Amended Complaint</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roman-Martinez argues that the district court erred in dismissing his amended complaint.  The district court held that the amended complaint would not survive a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  We hold that the court was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court held in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962), that a party ought ordinarily to be given an opportunity to test his claim on the merits.  However, the Court also noted exceptions to this rule as where prejudice to the amending party's adversary is shown or where the proposed amendment would constitute no more than a futile exercise.  Id.;  see also Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 59 (1st Cir.1990);  Kay v. New Hampshire Democratic Party, 821 F.2d 31, 34 (1st Cir.1987).  The latter exception applies here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roman-Martinez filed his formal complaint of discrimination on November 7, 1990.  On December 7, 1990, the Postal Service sent him a letter outlining the issues that the investigation would cover, and inviting him to respond if he disagreed with the scope of the investigation.  Appellant responded in a letter dated December 13, 1990, setting forth ten allegations of discrimination dating back to his first year with the Postal Service.  Of these, most were new to those presented in the original complaint, although the latter were also listed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If he wished to pursue the new allegations, Roman-Martinez was required to initiate a new complaint covering them.  He filed a second, informal, administrative complaint doing so, but never got around to filing and pursuing a formal administrative complaint incorporating the new items.  Instead, without ever having taken steps to achieve administrative redress, he waited and eventually transferred the contents of the stillborn administrative complaint into his amended judicial complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these facts, it was clear to the district court that the new items inserted into the amended judicial complaint were not only untimely because (like the original items discussed above) they dealt with incidents that occurred well before the appellant's first contact with an EEO counsellor, but were unripe for adjudication because they were never made the subject of a formal administrative complaint and proceedings.  To hold otherwise would allow appellant to circumvent the exhaustion requirement imposed on all who bring claims of handicap discrimination in federal court.  See Jensen, 912 F.2d at 520.   In these circumstances, allowing the amended complaint to be filed would have been a futile exercise since, as the district court correctly stated, it would have been subject to a successful motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint includes Torres-Correa, Roman-Martinez's wife, and their conjugal partnership as plaintiffs.

Shortly after ceasing to work for the Postal Service, Roman-Martinez complained administratively to the Postal Service that, while employed, he had been discriminated against because of his handicap in violation of his rights under The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794 et seq.  (1985).  After pursuing, without success, the prescribed course of administrative remedies within the Postal Service and before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Roman-Martinez instituted the current de novo judicial action under section 717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-16(c) (1994).  The district court entered summary judgment for the Postmaster General and refused to allow Roman-Martinez to file an amended complaint.  We affirm.I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roman-Martinez was honorably discharged from the United States Army in 1981.  The Veterans Administration found that he had a ten percent service-connected disability based upon hepatitis and a ten percent disability based upon lumbar sprain.  In 1987, he went to work for the Postal Service under the disabled veterans' preference provisions, see 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3309, 3313(2)(A) (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially employed as a labor custodian--a job which Roman-Martinez alleges was unsuitable because he was unfit to do heavy lifting and carrying--he soon became a distribution clerk.  However, Roman-Martinez contends that his new supervisor's refusal to assign him light-duty functions caused him to injure his back.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A medical examiner for the Postal Service found that Roman-Martinez was unable to carry anything over ten pounds, placed him on limited duty and recommended that he be transferred to Ponce, near his home.  The transfer to Ponce took place in January of 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About the same time, Roman-Martinez filed a claim for workers' compensation with the United States Department of Labor.  The Postal Service opposed the granting of workers' compensation, denying that Roman-Martinez's back injury had been work related.  On February 16, 1988, his claim was initially disallowed for lack of supporting medical data.  That same day, Roman-Martinez, having aggravated his back injury, saw a doctor who found him to be totally disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days later, Roman-Martinez confronted his supervisor, Bernie Sprolito, with the letter denying his workers' compensation claim.  Sprolito allegedly told Roman-Martinez that he had to surrender whatever had been paid to him under the claim, and that, notwithstanding Dr. Martin's medical report indicating total disability, he had to return to work or face discharge for absenteeism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of his conversation with Sprolito, Roman-Martinez continued to work at the Ponce office although allegedly suffering from severe pain.  He also began feeling persecuted and harassed by Postal Service employees, causing him, he says, to become mentally ill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following an appeal, the United States Department of Labor reopened Roman-Martinez's workers' compensation case and, on June 13, 1988, determined that his back injury had been work related.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-1989, he was found to have a schizophrenic-type disorder and was treated with psychotherapy and antipsychotic agents.  A psychiatrist described him as being suspicious, hostile and agitated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roman-Martinez's bargaining agent, the American Postal Workers Union (APWU), filed two grievances on his behalf.  In one, the APWU alleged that the Postal Service had violated the collective bargaining agreement by assigning him fewer hours than other part-time flexible employees.  In the other, the APWU claimed that the Postal Service had failed to place him on the clerk's seniority list at the Ponce office.  The APWU and the Postal Service settled both grievances shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 1990, Roman-Martinez stopped working for the Postal Service altogether, asserting that he had become totally incapacitated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not fully satisfied with the settlement of his grievances, Roman-Martinez contacted a Postal Service EEO counsellor on September 24, 1990, and argued that the Postal Service's refusal to give him a full complement of working hours and to place him on the clerk's seniority list had constituted discrimination on the basis of his physical disability.  On November 7, 1990, he filed with the Postal Service a formal administrative complaint of such discrimination.  In a final decision dated May 14, 1991, the Postal Service rejected Roman-Martinez's administrative complaint on the ground, among others, that he had failed to bring the allegedly discriminatory act to the attention of an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counsellor within thirty days of its occurrence, as required by the relevant regulation, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1613.214(a)(1)(i) (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roman-Martinez appealed to the EEOC from the Postal Service's ruling.  The EEOC, in January 1992, affirmed the Postal Service's determination that Roman-Martinez's claim was untimely because of his failure to have brought it to the attention of an EEO counselor within the thirty-day period.  The EEOC thereafter denied a request from Roman-Martinez to reopen its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 2, 1992, Roman-Martinez, his wife and their conjugal partnership brought this civil action pro se in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After the district court had appointed counsel, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f)(1) (1994), Roman-Martinez filed an amended complaint in mid-April 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, the district court entered an order granting the Postmaster General's motion for summary judgment, and dismissing Roman-Martinez's amended complaint.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties seem to agree, as do we, that the statutory basis for Roman-Martinez's action is 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-16(c) (1994).  Such an action confers upon the federal complainant the same right to a trial de novo as is enjoyed by private sector and state government employees under the amended Civil Rights Act of 1964.

(1985), prohibits discrimination against any otherwise qualified handicapped individual solely by reason of his or her handicap.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Act incorporates the rights, remedies, and procedures set forth in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act.  See Civil Rights Act of 1964, Sections 717, 706(f)-(k), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e-16, 2000e-5 (f)-(k) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 717 of Title VII does not set out the procedures, nor does it prescribe a limitations period, for the filing of grievances by a federal employee affected by an alleged unlawful practice.  But it grants to the EEOC authority to \"issue such rules, regulations, orders and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities under this section.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-16(b) (1994).  Pursuant to this authority, the EEOC issued regulations published in 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1613.214 (1995), which provided, in part:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(a) Time Limits.  (1) ... The agency may accept the complaint for processing ... only if:(i) The complainant brought to the attention of the Equal Employment Opportunity Counsellor the matter causing him/her to believe he/she had been discriminated against within 30 calendar days of the date of the alleged discriminatory event, the effective date of an alleged discriminatory personnel action, or the date that the aggrieved person knew or reasonably should have known of the discriminatory event or personnel action;  ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(4) The agency shall extend the time limits in this section when the complainant shows that he/she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, was prevented by circumstances beyond the complainant's control from submitting the matter within the time limits;  or for other reasons considered sufficient by the agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Postal Service and the EEOC both found that Roman-Martinez had failed to bring \"the matter causing [him] to believe [he] had been discriminated against\" to the attention of the Postal Service's EEO counsellor within the thirty-day period prescribed in the above regulation.  On the then undisputed assumption that he had first presented his complaints to EEO counsellor Lpez on September 24, 1990, the Postal Service and the EEOC determined that presentation on that date was plainly too late.  As Roman-Martinez had, indeed, ceased to work for the Postal Service during the previous June 1990, the effective date of the personnel actions he challenged--the refusal to give him a full complement of working hours and to place him on the seniority list--would seem necessarily to have occurred more than thirty days before the September 24 meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agreeing that Roman-Martinez had indisputably failed to meet the thirty-day requirement, the district court held that he was barred from proceeding with this civil action.  The court based its ruling on precedent in this circuit, and elsewhere, that a federal employee's failure to contact an EEO counsellor within the thirty-day period, or some valid extension allowed under the above-quoted regulations, causes him to lose his right to pursue a later de novo action in court.

Alleged Invalidity of Regulation Requiring Federal Employees to Bring Complaint to EEO Counsellor within Thirty Days</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roman-Martinez argues that requiring federal employees to consult with their agency's EEO counsellor within thirty days forces compliance with time limits so unreasonably short as to violate the statutory mandate.  Congress's intent, he says, was to provide federal employees, when victimized by discrimination, with remedies identical to those of state, municipal and private employees.  The latter, he points out, are allowed 180 days within which to file a complaint before the EEOC. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress, however, refrained from legislatively subjecting federal employees to the six-month period provided for other sorts of employees.  Rather, it delegated to the EEOC the authority to regulate the bringing of claims by federal employees.  The thirty-day regulation forces federal employees to try to conciliate their grievances promptly before seeking more formal administrative relief within the agency and before the EEOC.  Unlike the 180-day provision, the thirty days is not the period within which the formal complaint must be filed, but rather is the period within which the grievance must be presented for conciliation.  If that fails, a further brief period for filing the formal complaint is afforded.  In any case, the challenged procedures for federal employees were in continuous effect for nearly twenty years before appellant's claim arose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The thirty-day time limit has been accepted and enforced without criticism in cases litigated before the lower federal courts, including this one.  See, e.g., Jensen, 912 F.2d at 520.   We note, also, that the Supreme Court has applied time limitations of equal duration to the ones at issue in this case.  See Irwin v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span> (1990) (applying the pre-1991 thirty-day limitations period for filing Title VII civil actions);  Brown, 425 U.S. at 820, 96 S.Ct. at 1961-62 (same).  Had Congress wished to tie federal employees into the 180 days established for other categories of claimants, it could easily have done so.  And, of course, it remains open to Congress at any time, should it so wish, to legislate time limits different from those established by the EEOC.  We see no justification for us to override these well-established procedures set by the EEOC pursuant to congressional authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can we see anything so unreasonable in the relevant EEOC regulations as to violate the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution or to violate the requirements of due process.  Congress often regulates federal employees differently from other categories of persons;  there is nothing grossly unfair or arbitrary about the challenged regulations.  We accordingly uphold the district court's rejection of appellant's attack on the validity of the time limits in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>2. Roman-Martinez's Contention that He Earlier Brought this Claim to the EEO Counsellor's Attention</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Roman-Martinez sued in district court, he asserted there, for the first time, that he had contacted EEO counsellor Lpez prior to September 24, 1990, hence had complied with the thirty-day requirement.  Before considering this contention, we examine the administrative record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC, in its initial administrative decision reviewing the Postal Service's rejection of Roman-Martinez's claims, upheld the Postal Service's conclusion that by waiting until September 24, 1990, Roman-Martinez had failed timely to seek EEO counselling.  Roman-Martinez thereafter asked the EEOC to reconsider that decision, tendering as a justification for his delay a psychiatrist's statement that on September 24, 1990, the \"high levels of neuroleptic, anxiolitics, antidepressive medications\" prescribed for his mental disorder \"limited almost completely\" his functional level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC declined to reopen the case.  It noted that while appellant complained that the EEOC's prior decision involved an erroneous interpretation of law, he presented no arguments at all to support that allegation, and \"has not even addressed the substance of the EEOC's appellate decision.\"   The psychiatrist's statement itself was held \"not new because it was available and could have been presented when appellant initially appealed\" to the EEOC.  The statement did not, furthermore, address Roman-Martinez's ability to have sought timely EEO counselling before September 24, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In opposing summary judgment before the district court, Roman-Martinez did not renew the above contention that his failure to seek EEO counselling earlier had been justified because of the medications provided for his mental condition.  Instead, he raised an issue not presented during the administrative proceedings, namely, that he had in fact sought EEO counselling prior to the untimely September 24, 1990, meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an affidavit filed in the district court action, Roman-Martinez asserted that he had contacted EEO counsellor Lpez \"twice via telephone prior to September 24, 1990, at some period of time between October 1989 and June 1990, to communicate the discrimination I was being subjected to at the Ponce Post Office by Postmaster Oscar Rivera, among others.\"   The affidavit went on to report that \"Lpez told me that she would speak to Oscar Rivera to see what could be done about the situation.\"   Roman-Martinez now claims that this new contention raises a factual issue on which he was entitled to have a trial in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the above contention.  Citing Theard v. United States Army, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2400991\"><a href=\"/opinion/2400991/theard-v-us-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span>, 541 (M.D.N.C.1987), the court ruled that plaintiff's affidavit failed to establish that sufficient facts were brought to Lpez's attention \"such that the counsellor should have reasonably concluded that the employee was seeking to resolve, through EEO channels, an allegation of discrimination.\"   The court noted the absence of any reference in the alleged phone discussions with Lpez to specific personnel actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are inclined to agree with the district court that Roman-Martinez's affidavit was insufficiently clear to create a genuine issue of fact over whether he made an adequate presentation to an EEO counsellor prior to September 24, 1990.  Except for saying he communicated \"the discrimination I was being subjected to at the Ponce Post Office by Postmaster Oscar Rivera,\" appellant does not describe the nature of what he told Lpez.  Other evidence indicates that during this period Roman-Martinez was protesting, among others, the alleged violations of the union contract and the denial of his workers' compensation claim, leaving it unclear if in the alleged conversations with the Postal Service's EEO counsellor Roman-Martinez made a recognizable claim of handicap discrimination.  The counsellor denied having received any such claims prior to September 24, and even when appellant's affidavit is interpreted in a light most favorable to appellant, the substance of the claims actually conveyed cannot be ascertained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But while, therefore, the district court may well be right that Roman-Martinez's affidavit did not suffice to raise a genuine issue of fact, we do not decide on that basis alone.  Even supposing the affidavit were adequate to raise a factual issue, there is the additional problem, also noted by the district court, that Roman-Martinez never took the position before the Postal Service or the EEOC that he had presented his claim of handicap discrimination to an EEO counsellor prior to September 24, 1990.  Throughout the administrative proceedings, the apparently unchallenged date of his first presentation to an EEO counsellor was September 24, 1990.  Far from questioning this date, Roman-Martinez sought to justify his failure to have acted sooner by presenting a psychiatrist's letter stating that, being heavily medicated on September 24, 1990, his functional levels were \"limited almost completely.\"   The EEOC refused to reopen in order to consider this evidence, saying that the psychiatrist's statement was not material to claimant's ability to have sought timely counselling in the relevant earlier periods, and anyway came too late.  Roman-Martinez thereupon abandoned this contention when he sued in the district court.  He did not mention it in his opposition to the motion for summary judgment nor in his statement of controverted facts.  Rather, for the first time, he asserted the new and different proposition that he had actually presented his claim of handicap discrimination to an EEO counsellor prior to September 24, 1990, during telephone calls allegedly made between October 1989 and June 1990 to EEO counsellor Lpez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that Roman-Martinez, having never presented it during the administrative proceedings, may not raise this new factual contention in court proceedings for the first time.  To be sure, the exhaustion requirement should be applied with reasonable restraint where Congress has conferred the right to a de novo trial.  Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has described the present statutory scheme as \"a careful blend of administrative and judicial enforcement powers.\"  Brown, 425 U.S. at 833, 96 S.Ct. at 1968.   The lower federal courts have consistently found a duty in proceedings of this character to pursue and exhaust administrative remedies prior to the de novo trial.  Jensen, 912 F.2d at 520;  McGuinness, 744 F.2d at 1320.   We do not think that appellant may, for the first time, present to a judicial fact finder a key factual issue which he did not raise during prior agency proceedings and which, indeed, runs counter to assumptions (i.e. the September 24 date) that he seemingly accepted throughout the agency proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that the district court properly refused to consider Roman-Martinez's new-found assertion of having sought EEO counselling at an earlier time.  That argument was not exhausted before the administrative tribunals having jurisdiction to grant relief to appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same and additional reasons, the district court properly rejected Roman-Martinez's assertion that he had timely presented his claims because he had earlier relayed them to Bernie Sprolito, his supervisor and manager of the People with Handicap Program at the Ponce Post Office.  Not only was this contention not brought up during the course of the administrative proceedings, but it also falls short of demonstrating, even if proven, timely compliance with the thirty-day requirement.  Bernie Sprolito was not the EEO counsellor, nor did appellant present any evidence that Bernie Sprolito was ever held out to him as being the EEO counsellor.  See Jensen, 912 F.2d at 521 (appellant \"must allege and prove ... that the employer actively misled him and that he relied on the misconduct to his detriment\").  Nor has appellant asserted that he lacked notice of the correct procedures and time limits.  We find nothing in the reference to the conversations with Bernie Sprolito that excuses noncompliance with the thirty-day time limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Dismissal of Amended Complaint</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roman-Martinez argues that the district court erred in dismissing his amended complaint.  The district court held that the amended complaint would not survive a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  We hold that the court was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court held in Foman v. Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, 182, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 230, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (1962), that a party ought ordinarily to be given an opportunity to test his claim on the merits.  However, the Court also noted exceptions to this rule as where prejudice to the amending party's adversary is shown or where the proposed amendment would constitute no more than a futile exercise.  Id.;  see also Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.1990);  Kay v. New Hampshire Democratic Party, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489940\"><a href=\"/opinion/489940/richard-b-kay-v-new-hampshire-democratic-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.1987).  The latter exception applies here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roman-Martinez filed his formal complaint of discrimination on November 7, 1990.  On December 7, 1990, the Postal Service sent him a letter outlining the issues that the investigation would cover, and inviting him to respond if he disagreed with the scope of the investigation.  Appellant responded in a letter dated December 13, 1990, setting forth ten allegations of discrimination dating back to his first year with the Postal Service.  Of these, most were new to those presented in the original complaint, although the latter were also listed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If he wished to pursue the new allegations, Roman-Martinez was required to initiate a new complaint covering them.  He filed a second, informal, administrative complaint doing so, but never got around to filing and pursuing a formal administrative complaint incorporating the new items.  Instead, without ever having taken steps to achieve administrative redress, he waited and eventually transferred the contents of the stillborn administrative complaint into his amended judicial complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these facts, it was clear to the district court that the new items inserted into the amended judicial complaint were not only untimely because (like the original items discussed above) they dealt with incidents that occurred well before the appellant's first contact with an EEO counsellor, but were unripe for adjudication because they were never made the subject of a formal administrative complaint and proceedings.  To hold otherwise would allow appellant to circumvent the exhaustion requirement imposed on all who bring claims of handicap discrimination in federal court.  See Jensen, 912 F.2d at 520.   In these circumstances, allowing the amended complaint to be filed would have been a futile exercise since, as the district court correctly stated, it would have been subject to a successful motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint includes Torres-Correa, Roman-Martinez's wife, and their conjugal partnership as plaintiffs.  There is, however, no indication in the record that Torres-Correa was an employee of the Postal Service, or an applicant for such employment.  They were, therefore, outside the categories of persons authorized to sue under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-16(c) (1994), which appears to be the statutory basis for Roman-Martinez's current suit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794 (1985) provides:  \"No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service ...\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The quoted regulations were applicable to Roman-Martinez's administrative complaints made in 1990.
