HAMILTON,\n\n                       Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                 v.\n\n\n      CHERYL D.

Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n    Michael A. Hamilton on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n\n                          August 27, 2001\n\f          Per Curiam. Appellant Michael A. Hamilton filed a\n\ncomplaint in the Massachusetts federal district court and\n\nasked to proceed in forma pauperis.       His complaint attacked\n\nstate court proceedings which had resulted in the loss of\n\ncustody of his three children.       After granting IFP status,\n\nthe district court dismissed the complaint on the ground\n\nthat it lacked an arguable basis in law.          See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1915(e)(2)(B)(i) (\"the court shall dismiss the case at any\n\ntime if the court determines that . . . the action or appeal\n\n. . . is frivolous\").      In particular, the court determined\n\nthat the complaint was barred by the Massachusetts three-\n\nyear   statute   of   limitations   applicable   to    civil   rights\n\nactions brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n          We note, first, that appellant does not address,\n\non appeal, the merits of the district court's determination\n\nregarding the statute of limitations.      Of course, failure to\n\nargue an issue on appeal waives that issue.           Ortega Cabrera\n\nv. Municipality of Bayamon, 562 F.2d 91, 102 n.10 (1st Cir.\n\n1977).   This alone, then, would be reason to affirm the\n\ndistrict court judgment.\n\n          In any event, there was no error in the district\n\ncourt's decision.       Appellant argued below that a state\n\nstatute of limitations has nothing to do with a federal\n\fcivil rights action and that the district court had erred in\n\napplying any limitations period to his complaint.\n\n                 This assertion is palpably\n                 incorrect.     At   all  times\n                 material hereto, the law was\n                 clear that, when Congress had\n                 not    established    a   time\n                 limitation for a federal cause\n                 of action, a local limitations\n                 period was to be adopted as\n                 federal law so long as it was\n                 not inconsistent with federal\n                 law or policy to do so.\n                 [This] practice demand[s] the\n                 application of state personal\n                 injury statutes of limitations\n                 in section [1983] suits.\n\n\nJohnson v. Rodriguez, 943 F.2d 104, 107 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(citations omitted).       As a result, the Massachusetts three-\n\nyear statute of limitations for personal injury actions\n\napplies to this case.      See Nieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d 46,\n\n51 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing M.G.L.c. 260, § 2A).            Appellant's\n\nreliance on Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388\n\n(1971),   is   misplaced    as   that   case   did   not   involve   the\n\nquestion of the statute of limitations applicable to a civil\n\nrights action.\n\n           Appellant does not dispute the district court's\n\ndetermination that his cause of action accrued, at the\n\nlatest, on May 12, 1997, when Cheryl Dineen was awarded\n\ncustody of Hunter, the last of appellant's children.                 The\n\n                                  -3-\n\fprobate proceedings which resulted in appellant's loss of\n\ncustody plainly are the basis of appellant's complaint and\n\nthe complaint focuses on the alleged actions the defendants\n\ntook during these proceedings.    Thus, the complaint, filed\n\non September 5, 2000, was over three months late.\n\n         The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                            -4-\n\f",
