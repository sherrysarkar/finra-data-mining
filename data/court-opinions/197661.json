Appellant's\r\n\nfirst  contention, that his  nolo contendere plea  for simple\r                                                        \r\n\nassault in a prior state proceeding should have been excluded\r\n\nunder U.S.S.G.   4A1.2(c)(1), is without merit.  The crime of\r\n\nassault is not substantially similar to the excluded crime of\r\n\ndisorderly conduct.  Though an assault might  also qualify as\r\n\ndisorderly conduct,  the former involves not only a threat to\r\n\nthe public peace,  but also a threat to  the bodily integrity\r\n\nof  another individual.   Appellant cites no  authority which\r\n\nwould equate the two crimes,  and at least two other circuits\r\n\nhave  distinguished the two  crimes for purposes  of applying\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.2(c)(1);  see United States v.
