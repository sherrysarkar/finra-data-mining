Appellant Patrick  Tracy appeals  the\r                                \r\n\ndenial by the  United States District Court for  the District\r\n\nof  Maine of Tracy's motion  to vacate, set  aside or correct\r\n\nhis  sentence pursuant  to  28 U.S.C.     2255.   Tracy  also\r\n\nalleges  that the court erred  in denying his  request for an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing.    We  affirm  the denial  of  both  the\r\n\npetition and  the hearing, essentially for  the reasons given\r\n\nby the  magistrate judge  in his recommended  decision, dated\r\n\nAugust 16, 1995.   Only one of Tracy's claims  merits further\r\n\ncomment.\r\n\n     During Tracy's trial, three articles appeared in a local\r\n\nnewspaper referring to Tracy's  previously having been  found\r\n\nnot guilty  by reason of insanity  in a different  case.  The\r\n\nappearance  of the  articles was  noted by  the court  at the\r\n\ntime.    However, the  prosecutor  and  the defense  attorney\r\n\nagreed that  it was  better not to  question the jury  on the\r\n\nmatter  since  to do  so might  call  undue attention  to it.\r\n\nTracy alleges that the  failure of his counsel to  request an\r\n\nexamination of the jury constituted ineffective assistance of\r\n\ncounsel.  We disagree.  \r\n\n     The record makes clear that, both prior to and after the\r\n\narticles' appearance, the  court specifically instructed  the\r\n\njury  not to  listen  to or  to read  accounts of  the trial.\r\n\nAbsent  evidence  to the  contrary,  jurors  are presumed  to\r\n\nfollow a  court's instruction,  United States v.  Boylan, 898\r                                                                    \r\r\n\nF.2d  230, 263 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849 (1990),\r                                                   \r\n\nand no evidence existed at  the time, nor has any  since been\r\n\npresented,  that  any member  of the  jury  was aware  of the\r\n\narticles   in  question.    In  such  circumstances,  Tracy's\r\n\ncounsel's  decision  not to  request  an  examination of  the\r\n\njurors  may reasonably  be  understood as  sound strategy  to\r\n\navoid calling undue  attention to the  articles.  See  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Anello, 765 F.2d  253, 259 (1st  Cir.) (absent any\r                             \r\n\nindication  that jurors  were  aware of  incident, court  was\r\n\nwithin  its  discretion in  not  drawing attention  to  it by\r\n\ninquiring about incident), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 996 (1985).\r                                                   \r\n\nAs such it clearly \"falls within the wide range of reasonable\r\n\nprofessional  assistance\" and  thus  precludes  a finding  of\r\n\nineffective assistance.   Strickland v. Washington,  466 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n668, 689 (1984).\r\n\n     Tracy also claims  that his attorney  failed to ask  the\r\n\ncourt  to examine the  jury because the  attorney was himself\r\n\nthe source of  the newspaper  story and feared  that, if  the\r\n\nissue were pursued, he  would be discovered to  have violated\r\n\nDistrict of Maine Local Rule 40(a)(4).  This rule prohibits a\r\n\ndefense attorney from releasing  information during trial \"if\r\n\nthere is a reasonable likelihood that such dissemination will\r\n\nseriously interfere with  a fair trial.\"   Tracy alleges that\r\n\nthe resulting  conflict of interest between  the attorney and\r\n\nhimself constitutes constitutionally ineffective assistance.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     To show a conflict  of interest, \"a defendant  must show\r\n\nthat  (1) the lawyer  could have pursued  a plausible defense\r\n\nstrategy or tactic and (2) the alternative strategy or tactic\r\n\nwas  inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the\r\n\nattorney's other  interests or loyalties.\"   United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSoldevila-Lopez, 17  F.3d 480, 486  (1st Cir. 1994).   Courts\r                           \r\n\nhave  recognized that a conflict  of interest may result when\r\n\npursuit of  a  client's interest  would lead  to evidence  of\r\n\nattorney malpractice.  See United States v. Ellison, 798 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1102, 1106-08 (7th  Cir. 1986), cert.  denied, 479 U.S.  1038\r                                                         \r\n\n(1987)  (defendant  had  accused  attorney  of  malpractice);\r\n\nMathis  v. Hood, 937 F.2d 790, 795 (2d. Cir. 1991) (defendant\r                           \r\n\nhad filed grievance with  disciplinary committee).  A showing\r\n\nof  an  actual conflict  of  interest  obviates the  need  to\r\n\ndemonstrate prejudice  and constitutes a per  se violation of\r                                                            \r\n\nthe Sixth Amendment.  Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 486-87.  \r                                                 \r\n\n     Even if we credit Tracy's  allegations, he has not  made\r\n\nthe requisite  showing that his attorney's failure to seek an\r\n\nexamination  of  the  jury  was  due to  other  interests  or\r\n\nloyalties.   First,  Tracy  has not  explained how  examining\r\n\nwhether  or not  the jury  had been  exposed to  the articles\r\n\nwould  have led  to the  further examination  of who  was the\r\n\nsource  of the articles.  Moreover,  at the time the issue of\r\n\nthe articles arose, Tracy's attorney had not been  accused of\r\n\nany wrongdoing.   This  fact distinguishes Tracy's  case from\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nboth  Ellison and  Mathis.    In  the  absence  of  any  such\r                                     \r\n\naccusation  of the  attorney or  other evidence  of a  per se\r                                                                         \r\n\nviolation of the  Sixth Amendment, the charge  of conflict of\r\n\ninterest  is   simply  too   \"speculative\"   to  support   an\r\n\nineffective  assistance  of  counsel claim.    See Soldevila-\r                                                                         \r\n\nLopez, 17 F.3d at 486-87.\r                 \r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc.

Courts have recognized that a conflict of interest may result when pursuit of a client's interest would lead to evidence of attorney malpractice.  See United States v. Ellison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474884\"><a href=\"/opinion/474884/united-states-v-max-allen-ellison/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></a></span>, 1106-08 (7th Cir.1986), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1038</span></span> (1987) (defendant had accused attorney of malpractice);  Mathis v. Hood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564322\"><a href=\"/opinion/564322/homer-aki-mathis-v-david-hood-superintendent-otisville-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span>, 795 (2d.   Cir.1991) (defendant had filed grievance with disciplinary committee).   A showing of an actual conflict of interest obviates the need to demonstrate prejudice and constitutes a per se violation of the Sixth Amendment.  Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 486-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we credit Tracy's allegations, he has not made the requisite showing that his attorney's failure to seek an examination of the jury was due to other interests or loyalties.   First, Tracy has not explained how examining whether or not the jury had been exposed to the articles would have led to the further examination of who was the source of the articles.   Moreover, at the time the issue of the articles arose, Tracy's attorney had not been accused of any wrongdoing.   This fact distinguishes Tracy's case from both Ellison and Mathis.   In the absence of any such accusation of the attorney or other evidence of a per se violation of the Sixth Amendment, the charge of conflict of interest is simply too \"speculative\" to support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.  See Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 486-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. See 1st Cir.  Loc. R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
