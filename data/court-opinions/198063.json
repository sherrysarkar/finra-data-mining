Plaintiff Steven Romn filed\r\nthis action against his former employer Maietta Construction, Inc.\r\n(\"Maietta\") for back pay plus liquidated damages under section\r\n16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\").  Romn also joined\r\npendent state claims for unpaid wages and overtime pay under 26 Me.\r\nRev. Stat. Ann.  670, 626-A.  While the trial court ultimately\r\nawarded plaintiff $2,436 plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees,\r\nit denied Romn's claim for compensation for time spent at the race\r\ntrack as a crew chief for stock cars raced by the son of Maietta's\r\nowner.  The court also rejected plaintiff's claim for damages under\r\n26  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.  626-A.  Romn appeals these portions of\r\nthe judgment.  He also challenges certain factual findings as well\r\nas the trial court's calculation of damages.  We affirm.\r\n                I.  BACKGROUND     The following facts are largely undisputed.  We summarize\r\ndisputed facts in a manner consistent with the district court's\r\nsupportable findings of fact.  See United States v. Gallo, 20 F.3d\r\n7, 9 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nRomn became interested in stock car racing in the late\r\n1970s.  Prior to 1984, he owned and raced two stock cars, serving\r\nas crew chief for these cars and paying the drivers a percentage of\r\nthe winnings.  During this time, he also served as crew chief for\r\ntwo stock cars that he did not own.  He considered the members of\r\nthe crews on the cars that he owned to be volunteers and did not\r\ncompensate them.  Moreover, he was not paid for his work as crew\r\nchief on the cars that he did not own, and in fact, considered\r\nhimself a volunteer when he worked in that capacity.\r\nRomn met Michael Maietta, Sr. (\"Michael\"), a son of the\r\nowner of Maietta, at the race track where both of them did most of\r\ntheir racing.  In 1984, Romn provided building and repair services\r\nfor the stock cars raced by Michael at Romn's body shop in\r\nWindham, Maine.  Romn was paid for these services.  At the time,\r\nRomn made his living from the body shop.  In 1985, Romn began\r\nserving as crew chief for Michael's stock cars.  He performed this\r\nwork as a volunteer.  His duties as crew chief for the stock cars\r\nincluded being present at weekly races from April through October\r\nevery year.  Races were usually held on Saturdays, although some\r\nraces occurred on Sundays or on Friday or Wednesday nights. \r\nOccasionally, there were two races in a week.\r\nMaietta advertised at the race track where Michael raced,\r\nmost often as part of a package deal that it arranged with the\r\nowner of the track.  Maietta provided some parts and services, but\r\nno cash, to Michael in connection with his racing, and the\r\ncompany's name was painted on Michael's stock cars as a sponsor. \r\nAt all relevant times, the construction company did not own these\r\nstock cars.\r\nIn 1987, Romn asked Michael whether Maietta could hire\r\nhim to work as a welder.  Michael is not and never has been an\r\nofficer, owner, or director of Maietta, although he was employed by\r\nthe company in a supervisory position.  Michael approached his\r\nfather, Louis Maietta, Sr. (\"Louis Sr.\"), with this request and\r\nLouis Sr. approved the hiring of Romn as a welder at $12 per hour. \r\nRomn was employed by Maietta from the fall of 1987 through\r\nJune 26, 1995.\r\nThe year Romn was hired, Louis Sr. gave Michael\r\npermission to move his stock cars from Romn's Windham shop to the\r\nconstruction company's business premises in Scarborough, Maine, on\r\nthe condition that no one work on the cars during regular business\r\nhours.  However, Romn regularly worked on the stock cars during\r\nbusiness hours.  He recorded all of the time during which he worked\r\non the stock cars at Maietta's premises on his time cards, which\r\nwere processed through the company's time clock.  All of the\r\nsupervisors at the premises, who were sons of Louis Sr., were aware\r\nof these activities but did not direct Romn to stop.  Whenever\r\nLouis Sr. learned that Romn was working on the stock cars during\r\nbusiness hours, he would tell Romn to stop or tell one of his sons\r\nto tell Romn to stop.  However, Louis Sr.'s sons continued\r\nthereafter to permit Romn to work on the stock cars while on the\r\nfirm's time clock.  Romn was paid by Maietta for all the hours he\r\nrecorded, including the hours spent working on the stock cars.\r\nIn 1989, Romn's pay was increased to $16 per hour.  He\r\nwas frequently paid time and one-half by Maietta for overtime\r\nhours.  Romn spent many of these hours working on Michael's stock\r\ncars.  At some time during his employment, Romn and Louis Maietta,\r\nJr. (\"Louis Jr.\"), one of Louis Sr.'s sons and vice-president and\r\na director of Maietta, agreed that any hours over 40 hours in a\r\ngiven week spent by Romn working on the stock cars at Maietta's\r\nbusiness premises would be \"held\" rather than included in his\r\npaycheck for that week.  Payment for these held hours was\r\naccomplished in stages by paying him on the basis of a 40-hour work\r\nweek in weeks when he, in fact, worked fewer than 40 hours.  Romn\r\nand Maietta, acting through Louis Jr., referred to these held hours\r\nas \"compensatory time.\"  They also agreed that Romn could take\r\ncompensatory time off in exchange for held hours.   Between June 9,\r\n1993 and August 24, 1994, Maietta held a total of 120.75 hours from\r\nRomn's time cards.  During this same time period, Maietta paid\r\nRomn for a total of 105 hours in compensatory time at the rate of\r\n$16 per hour.\r\nIn August 1994, Romn sustained an injury while working\r\nat Maietta.  He returned to work in November 1994, but his\r\nrelationship with the company and with Michael deteriorated\r\nthereafter.  Romn did not serve as Michael's crew chief after the\r\n1994 season.  After Romn ceased working for the construction\r\ncompany on June 26, 1995, he filed this action under the FLSA for\r\nadditional wages he contended were due to him.  In particular, the\r\nplaintiff sought back pay for serving as Michael's crew chief\r\nduring weekend races.  He also joined pendant state law claims.\r\nBoth parties consented to having a magistrate conduct all\r\nproceedings in the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  636(c).  Following\r\nthree days of hearings, the magistrate determined that, under the\r\nFLSA, the plaintiff was entitled to overtime pay for all\r\ncompensatory time.  The court awarded the plaintiff an additional\r\n$8 per hour for the 105 hours of compensatory time for which he had\r\nreceived only $16 per hour, and awarded the overtime rate of $24\r\nper hour for the 15.75 hours of compensatory time for which he was\r\nnot paid, for a total of $1,218.  The trial court also ruled that,\r\nunder both the FLSA and state law, Romn was entitled to liquidated\r\ndamages in the amount of the unpaid overtime plus costs and\r\nattorney's fees.  Thus, the magistrate rendered judgment for Romn\r\nin the amount of $2,436 plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees. \r\nHowever, the trial court denied back pay for Romn's services as\r\nMichael's crew chief.  In addition, the trial court found that\r\nRomn was not entitled to damages in excess of those provided by\r\nthe FLSA because the FLSA was the exclusive remedy for the\r\nenforcement of rights created under the act.  On appeal, Romn\r\nchallenges these aspects of the judgment.\r\n               II.  DISCUSSION\r\nWe review a trial court's findings of fact for clear\r\nerror and its application of the law to the facts de novo.  SeeReich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., 126 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nA.   Factual Findings\r\nRomn challenges the trial court's finding of fact that,\r\nprior to joining Michael's racing team, the plaintiff considered\r\nhimself a volunteer when he served as crew chief on two stock cars\r\nhe did not own.  We find no clear error in the court's\r\ndetermination.  With respect to one of the cars, Romn specifically\r\ntestified, \"I was a volunteer.\"  In addition, plaintiff testified\r\nthat his crew chief activities turned from sport to work when he\r\njoined Michael's crew.  The court could have reasonably concluded\r\nfrom this testimony that Romn considered himself a volunteer on\r\nany stock car he worked on prior to Michael's stock cars. \r\nAccordingly, we see sufficient record support to affirm the trial\r\ncourt's finding that Romn was a volunteer on the two stock cars at\r\nissue.\r\nRomn also disputes the trial court's factual finding\r\nthat the construction company contributed no cash to Michael's\r\nracing activities, citing to various portions of the trial\r\ntranscript which provide some backing for his challenge.  However,\r\nother parts of the transcript, such as Michael's testimony that he\r\nreceived no cash from the construction company for his racing team,\r\ncorroborate the trial court's finding.\r\nUndoubtedly, Maietta provided some financial support for\r\nMichael's racing endeavors.  Nevertheless, we are not convinced\r\nthat the record clearly establishes that the company made cash\r\ncontributions to Michael for his racing team.  \"A finding of fact\r\nis clearly erroneous when the reviewing court is left with the\r\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\" \r\nMitchell v. United States, 141 F.3d 8, 17 (1st Cir. 1998).  Lacking\r\nsuch a conviction, we rule that the trial court did not commit\r\nclear error in finding that Maietta did not provide funding to\r\nMichael in connection with his stock car racing.\r\nB.   Romn's Crew Chief Activities\r\nRomn challenges the trial court's conclusion that the\r\nweekend time he devoted to his crew chief activities for Michael's\r\nstock cars was not compensable under the FLSA.  The FLSA provides\r\nin relevant part that \"no employer shall employ any of his\r\nemployees . . . for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such\r\nemployee receives compensation for his employment in excess of\r\n[forty] hours . . . at a rate no less than one and one-half times\r\nthe regular rate at which he is employed.\"  29 U.S.C.  207(a). \r\nThe act \"defines the verb 'employ' expansively to mean 'suffer or\r\npermit to work.'\"  Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S.\r\n318, 326 (1992); see also 29 U.S.C.  203(g).  \"The employer-\r\nemployee relationship does not lend itself to rigid per se\r\ndefinitions, but depends 'upon the circumstances of the whole\r\nactivity.'\"  Reich v. ConAgra, Inc., 987 F.2d 1357, 1361 (8th Cir.\r\n1993) (citing Marshall v. Truman Arnold Distrib. Co., Inc., 640\r\nF.2d 906, 908 (8th Cir. 1981)).  Viewing Romn's activities as a\r\nwhole, we agree with the trial court that the FLSA does not require\r\nMaietta to compensate Romn for his crew chief duties at the race\r\ntrack.\r\nMaietta hired Romn to work as a welder on its business\r\npremises.  However, the record reflects that he spent a substantial\r\namount of his time at the job site working on Michael's stock cars. \r\nRomn contends that since he performed the same type of work on the\r\nstock cars at the race tracks, his weekend racing activities were\r\nan extension of his workweek.  Thus, according to the plaintiff, he\r\nis entitled to compensation for any time spent as Michael's crew\r\nchief.\r\nThe FLSA applies to \"physical or mental exertion (whether\r\nburdensome or not) controlled or required by the employer and\r\npursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer\r\nand his business.\"  Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R.R. Co. v. Muscoda\r\nLocal No. 123, 321 U.S. 590, 598 (1944).  Several of Romn's\r\nsupervisors did permit him to work on stock cars during business\r\nhours.  Nevertheless, nothing in the record supports the claim that\r\nMaietta Construction required Romn to serve as crew chief as part\r\nof his job.  Indeed, as the magistrate observed, \"[t]he work\r\nperformed by Romn at the race tracks was not primarily for the\r\nbenefit of Maietta; . . . the benefit to Maietta, if any, is too\r\ntenuous to provide the basis for any legal liability to pay wages\r\nfor that work.\"  Romn v. Maietta Constr., Inc., No. 96-256, slip\r\nop. at 5 (D. Me. Aug. 13, 1997).\r\nWhile Maietta's name as well as those of other companies\r\nwere painted on Michael's stock cars as sponsors, the link between\r\nany potential benefits accruing to the construction firm from\r\nMichael's performance as a stock car driver and Romn's crew chief\r\nactivities is far too attenuated to trigger the FLSA.  Maietta may\r\nhave garnered some advertising benefits from the success of\r\nMichael's racing team, but such indirect benefits do not establish\r\nan employer-employee relationship between the construction firm and\r\nanyone who may have contributed his time to that activity.\r\nFurthermore, the record suggests that Romn served as\r\ncrew chief for his personal enjoyment rather than for the benefit\r\nof Maietta.  Prior to joining Michael's racing team, Romn served\r\nas a volunteer crew chief for his own stock cars as well as for two\r\ncars he did not own.  In addition, he considered himself a\r\nvolunteer on Michael's crew before he started working for Maietta. \r\nFrom this evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that he continued\r\nto pursue his crew chief activities primarily for his personal\r\nbenefit during his employment as a Maietta welder.\r\nRomn responds that the fact he may have volunteered to\r\nbe Michael's crew chief is not determinative.  He argues in his\r\nbrief, \"[t]he crucial question is not whether the work was\r\nvoluntary but rather whether the (employee) was in fact performing\r\nservices for the benefit of the employer with the knowledge and\r\napproval of the employer.\"  Secretary of Labor v. E.R. Field, Inc.,\r\n495 F.2d 749, 751 (1st Cir. 1974).  Romn fails to recognize that\r\nhe was hired to weld and fabricate construction equipment rather\r\nthan to help Michael race his stock cars.  If the plaintiff had\r\nvoluntarily expended extra time engaged in welding work, and\r\nMaietta knew and approved of such work, the company would have to\r\ncompensate Romn for those hours.  However, we have established\r\nthat the connection between Romn's crew chief activities and any\r\nbenefits to Maietta is too insubstantial to warrant compensation\r\nunder the FLSA.  Therefore, Romn cannot recover for the time he\r\nvolunteered to serve as Michael's crew chief.\r\nC.   State Law Penalties\r\nRomn argues that the trial court erred in failing to\r\ngrant him the remedies set forth in 26 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.  626-A\r\nfor Maietta's violation of  621 of that statute.  We disagree. \r\nAs the trial court noted, \"the FLSA is the exclusive remedy for\r\nenforcement of rights created under the FLSA.\"  Romn, No. 96-256,\r\nslip op. at 7 (citing Tombrello v. USX Corp., 763 F. Supp. 541, 544\r\n(N.D. Ala. 1991)).  That is, \"the plaintiff cannot circumvent the\r\nexclusive remedy prescribed by Congress by asserting equivalent\r\nstate claims in addition to the FLSA claim.\"  Tombrello, 763 F.\r\nSupp. at 545.\r\nRomn contends that his claim for relief under  621(1)\r\nhas no FLSA equivalent.  However, our review of the complaint as\r\nwell as the record shows that Romn never raised a claim under that\r\nsubsection.  Instead, Romn sought relief under both the FLSA and\r\n26 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.  664 and 670 for minimum wage and overtime\r\npay violations.  Since Romn received compensation under the FLSA\r\nfor his claims, he cannot recover again under Maine law.\r\nD.   Compensatory Time\r\nRomn contends that the trial court erred in calculating\r\nhis back pay award.  The court ruled that Romn was entitled to the\r\novertime rate of $24 an hour for 120.75 hours of compensatory time. \r\nHowever, it credited Maietta for payment of $16 an hour for 105 of\r\nthese hours.  In effect, the trial court deducted any compensatory\r\ntime payments already made by Maietta to Romn at the regular rate\r\nof pay from the total overtime pay he should have received for\r\nthose held hours.  The plaintiff argues that the trial court erred\r\nin allowing such a deduction.\r\nAs previously mentioned, the FLSA requires employers to\r\ncompensate employees at a rate one and one-half times the regular\r\nrate of pay for any hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. \r\nSee 29 U.S.C.  207(a).  These payments must be made in \"cash or\r\nits equivalent.\"  29 C.F.R.  531.27.  \"Employers and employees may\r\nnot, in general, make agreements to pay and receive less pay than\r\nthe statute provides for.  Such agreements are against public\r\npolicy and unenforceable.\"  See Rudolph v. Metropolitan Airports\r\nComm'n, 103 F.3d 677, 680 (8th Cir. 1996) (citing Barrentine v.\r\nArkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 450 U.S. 728 (1981)).  Thus, we\r\nagree with the trial court that Romn is entitled to overtime pay\r\nfor his compensatory time.\r\nWe reject Romn's challenge to the trial court's\r\ncalculation of back pay.  In resolving this issue, we find D'Camerav. District of Columbia, 722 F. Supp. 799 (D.D.C. 1989), the case\r\ncited by appellee, persuasive.  In D'Camera, the district court\r\nallowed the District of Columbia to deduct compensatory time used\r\nby the plaintiff police officers from an award of back pay.  While\r\nthe district court acknowledged that \"[t]he FLSA does not expressly\r\nauthorize such a deduction, nor does its legislative history offer\r\nany guidance,\"  it found the District of Columbia's calculation to\r\nbe \"fair and permissible under the Act.\"  Id. at 803.  The district\r\ncourt held, and we concur, that \"[p]laintiffs are entitled to be\r\nmade whole, not to a windfall at the [defendant's] expense.\"\r\nThe language of the statute also suggests that we follow\r\nthis course.  Section 216(b) reads, \"[a]ny employer who violates\r\nthe provisions of sections 206 or section 207 of this title shall\r\nbe liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of\r\ntheir . . . unpaid overtime compensation . . . and in an additional\r\nequal amount as liquidated damages.\"  29 U.S.C.  216(b) (emphasis\r\nadded).  Since Romn received partial payment for his overtime\r\nhours, Maietta remains responsible only for the unpaid portion.  We\r\nfind that the trial court's award of liquidated damages adequately\r\ncompensated him for Maietta's violation of the FLSA.  Cf. D'Camera,\r\n722 F. Supp. at 804.  Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's\r\naward of $2,436 plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\r\n              III.  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court's\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law.\r\nCosts to appellee.\n",

In 1984, Romn provided building and repair services\r\nfor the stock cars raced by Michael at Romn's body shop in\r\nWindham, Maine.  Romn was paid for these services.  At the time,\r\nRomn made his living from the body shop.  In 1985, Romn began\r\nserving as crew chief for Michael's stock cars.  He performed this\r\nwork as a volunteer.  His duties as crew chief for the stock cars\r\nincluded being present at weekly races from April through October\r\nevery year.  Races were usually held on Saturdays, although some\r\nraces occurred on Sundays or on Friday or Wednesday nights. \r\nOccasionally, there were two races in a week.\r\nMaietta advertised at the race track where Michael raced,\r\nmost often as part of a package deal that it arranged with the\r\nowner of the track.  Maietta provided some parts and services, but\r\nno cash, to Michael in connection with his racing, and the\r\ncompany's name was painted on Michael's stock cars as a sponsor. \r\nAt all relevant times, the construction company did not own these\r\nstock cars.\r\nIn 1987, Romn asked Michael whether Maietta could hire\r\nhim to work as a welder.  Michael is not and never has been an\r\nofficer, owner, or director of Maietta, although he was employed by\r\nthe company in a supervisory position.  Michael approached his\r\nfather, Louis Maietta, Sr. (\"Louis Sr.\"), with this request and\r\nLouis Sr. approved the hiring of Romn as a welder at $12 per hour. \r\nRomn was employed by Maietta from the fall of 1987 through\r\nJune 26, 1995.\r\nThe year Romn was hired, Louis Sr. gave Michael\r\npermission to move his stock cars from Romn's Windham shop to the\r\nconstruction company's business premises in Scarborough, Maine, on\r\nthe condition that no one work on the cars during regular business\r\nhours.  However, Romn regularly worked on the stock cars during\r\nbusiness hours.  He recorded all of the time during which he worked\r\non the stock cars at Maietta's premises on his time cards, which\r\nwere processed through the company's time clock.  All of the\r\nsupervisors at the premises, who were sons of Louis Sr., were aware\r\nof these activities but did not direct Romn to stop.  Whenever\r\nLouis Sr. learned that Romn was working on the stock cars during\r\nbusiness hours, he would tell Romn to stop or tell one of his sons\r\nto tell Romn to stop.  However, Louis Sr.'s sons continued\r\nthereafter to permit Romn to work on the stock cars while on the\r\nfirm's time clock.  Romn was paid by Maietta for all the hours he\r\nrecorded, including the hours spent working on the stock cars.\r\nIn 1989, Romn's pay was increased to $16 per hour.  He\r\nwas frequently paid time and one-half by Maietta for overtime\r\nhours.  Romn spent many of these hours working on Michael's stock\r\ncars.  At some time during his employment, Romn and Louis Maietta,\r\nJr. (\"Louis Jr.\"), one of Louis Sr.'s sons and vice-president and\r\na director of Maietta, agreed that any hours over 40 hours in a\r\ngiven week spent by Romn working on the stock cars at Maietta's\r\nbusiness premises would be \"held\" rather than included in his\r\npaycheck for that week.  Payment for these held hours was\r\naccomplished in stages by paying him on the basis of a 40-hour work\r\nweek in weeks when he, in fact, worked fewer than 40 hours.  Romn\r\nand Maietta, acting through Louis Jr., referred to these held hours\r\nas \"compensatory time.\"  They also agreed that Romn could take\r\ncompensatory time off in exchange for held hours.   Between June 9,\r\n1993 and August 24, 1994, Maietta held a total of 120.75 hours from\r\nRomn's time cards.  During this same time period, Maietta paid\r\nRomn for a total of 105 hours in compensatory time at the rate of\r\n$16 per hour.\r\nIn August 1994, Romn sustained an injury while working\r\nat Maietta.  He returned to work in November 1994, but his\r\nrelationship with the company and with Michael deteriorated\r\nthereafter.  Romn did not serve as Michael's crew chief after the\r\n1994 season.  After Romn ceased working for the construction\r\ncompany on June 26, 1995, he filed this action under the FLSA for\r\nadditional wages he contended were due to him.  In particular, the\r\nplaintiff sought back pay for serving as Michael's crew chief\r\nduring weekend races.  He also joined pendant state law claims.\r\nBoth parties consented to having a magistrate conduct all\r\nproceedings in the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  636(c).  Following\r\nthree days of hearings, the magistrate determined that, under the\r\nFLSA, the plaintiff was entitled to overtime pay for all\r\ncompensatory time.  The court awarded the plaintiff an additional\r\n$8 per hour for the 105 hours of compensatory time for which he had\r\nreceived only $16 per hour, and awarded the overtime rate of $24\r\nper hour for the 15.75 hours of compensatory time for which he was\r\nnot paid, for a total of $1,218.  The trial court also ruled that,\r\nunder both the FLSA and state law, Romn was entitled to liquidated\r\ndamages in the amount of the unpaid overtime plus costs and\r\nattorney's fees.  Thus, the magistrate rendered judgment for Romn\r\nin the amount of $2,436 plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees. \r\nHowever, the trial court denied back pay for Romn's services as\r\nMichael's crew chief.  In addition, the trial court found that\r\nRomn was not entitled to damages in excess of those provided by\r\nthe FLSA because the FLSA was the exclusive remedy for the\r\nenforcement of rights created under the act.  On appeal, Romn\r\nchallenges these aspects of the judgment.\r\n               II.  DISCUSSION\r\nWe review a trial court's findings of fact for clear\r\nerror and its application of the law to the facts de novo.  SeeReich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197565\"><a href=\"/opinion/197565/reich-v-john-alden/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nA.   Factual Findings\r\nRomn challenges the trial court's finding of fact that,\r\nprior to joining Michael's racing team, the plaintiff considered\r\nhimself a volunteer when he served as crew chief on two stock cars\r\nhe did not own.  We find no clear error in the court's\r\ndetermination.  With respect to one of the cars, Romn specifically\r\ntestified, \"I was a volunteer.\"  In addition, plaintiff testified\r\nthat his crew chief activities turned from sport to work when he\r\njoined Michael's crew.  The court could have reasonably concluded\r\nfrom this testimony that Romn considered himself a volunteer on\r\nany stock car he worked on prior to Michael's stock cars. \r\nAccordingly, we see sufficient record support to affirm the trial\r\ncourt's finding that Romn was a volunteer on the two stock cars at\r\nissue.\r\nRomn also disputes the trial court's factual finding\r\nthat the construction company contributed no cash to Michael's\r\nracing activities, citing to various portions of the trial\r\ntranscript which provide some backing for his challenge.  However,\r\nother parts of the transcript, such as Michael's testimony that he\r\nreceived no cash from the construction company for his racing team,\r\ncorroborate the trial court's finding.\r\nUndoubtedly, Maietta provided some financial support for\r\nMichael's racing endeavors.  Nevertheless, we are not convinced\r\nthat the record clearly establishes that the company made cash\r\ncontributions to Michael for his racing team.  \"A finding of fact\r\nis clearly erroneous when the reviewing court is left with the\r\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\" \r\nMitchell v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197865\"><a href=\"/opinion/197865/mitchell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1998).  Lacking\r\nsuch a conviction, we rule that the trial court did not commit\r\nclear error in finding that Maietta did not provide funding to\r\nMichael in connection with his stock car racing.\r\nB.   Romn's Crew Chief Activities\r\nRomn challenges the trial court's conclusion that the\r\nweekend time he devoted to his crew chief activities for Michael's\r\nstock cars was not compensable under the FLSA.  The FLSA provides\r\nin relevant part that \"no employer shall employ any of his\r\nemployees . . . for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such\r\nemployee receives compensation for his employment in excess of\r\n[forty] hours . . . at a rate no less than one and one-half times\r\nthe regular rate at which he is employed.\"  29 U.S.C.  207(a). \r\nThe act \"defines the verb 'employ' expansively to mean 'suffer or\r\npermit to work.'\"  Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112710\"><a href=\"/opinion/112710/nationwide-mut-ins-co-v-darden/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326 (1992); see also 29 U.S.C.  203(g).  \"The employer-\r\nemployee relationship does not lend itself to rigid per se\r\ndefinitions, but depends 'upon the circumstances of the whole\r\nactivity.'\"  Reich v. ConAgra, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601847\"><a href=\"/opinion/601847/robert-reich-secretary-of-labor-united-states-department-of-labor-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1357</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1361 (8th Cir.\r\n1993) (citing Marshall v. Truman Arnold Distrib. Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387128\"><a href=\"/opinion/387128/ray-marshall-secretary-of-labor-united-states-department-of-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">640</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 908 (8th Cir. 1981)).  Viewing Romn's activities as a\r\nwhole, we agree with the trial court that the FLSA does not require\r\nMaietta to compensate Romn for his crew chief duties at the race\r\ntrack.\r\nMaietta hired Romn to work as a welder on its business\r\npremises.  However, the record reflects that he spent a substantial\r\namount of his time at the job site working on Michael's stock cars. \r\nRomn contends that since he performed the same type of work on the\r\nstock cars at the race tracks, his weekend racing activities were\r\nan extension of his workweek.  Thus, according to the plaintiff, he\r\nis entitled to compensation for any time spent as Michael's crew\r\nchief.\r\nThe FLSA applies to \"physical or mental exertion (whether\r\nburdensome or not) controlled or required by the employer and\r\npursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer\r\nand his business.\"  Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R.R. Co. v. Muscoda\r\nLocal No. 123, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103958\"><a href=\"/opinion/103958/tennessee-coal-iron-r-co-v-muscoda-local-no-123/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 598 (1944).  Several of Romn's\r\nsupervisors did permit him to work on stock cars during business\r\nhours.  Nevertheless, nothing in the record supports the claim that\r\nMaietta Construction required Romn to serve as crew chief as part\r\nof his job.  Indeed, as the magistrate observed, \"[t]he work\r\nperformed by Romn at the race tracks was not primarily for the\r\nbenefit of Maietta; . . . the benefit to Maietta, if any, is too\r\ntenuous to provide the basis for any legal liability to pay wages\r\nfor that work.\"  Romn v. Maietta Constr., Inc., No. 96-256, slip\r\nop. at 5 (D. Me. Aug. 13, 1997).\r\nWhile Maietta's name as well as those of other companies\r\nwere painted on Michael's stock cars as sponsors, the link between\r\nany potential benefits accruing to the construction firm from\r\nMichael's performance as a stock car driver and Romn's crew chief\r\nactivities is far too attenuated to trigger the FLSA.  Maietta may\r\nhave garnered some advertising benefits from the success of\r\nMichael's racing team, but such indirect benefits do not establish\r\nan employer-employee relationship between the construction firm and\r\nanyone who may have contributed his time to that activity.\r\nFurthermore, the record suggests that Romn served as\r\ncrew chief for his personal enjoyment rather than for the benefit\r\nof Maietta.  Prior to joining Michael's racing team, Romn served\r\nas a volunteer crew chief for his own stock cars as well as for two\r\ncars he did not own.  In addition, he considered himself a\r\nvolunteer on Michael's crew before he started working for Maietta. \r\nFrom this evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that he continued\r\nto pursue his crew chief activities primarily for his personal\r\nbenefit during his employment as a Maietta welder.\r\nRomn responds that the fact he may have volunteered to\r\nbe Michael's crew chief is not determinative.  He argues in his\r\nbrief, \"[t]he crucial question is not whether the work was\r\nvoluntary but rather whether the (employee) was in fact performing\r\nservices for the benefit of the employer with the knowledge and\r\napproval of the employer.\"  Secretary of Labor v. E.R. Field, Inc.,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"318566\"><a href=\"/opinion/318566/secretary-of-labor-united-states-department-of-labor-v-e-r-field-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 751 (1st Cir. 1974).  Romn fails to recognize that\r\nhe was hired to weld and fabricate construction equipment rather\r\nthan to help Michael race his stock cars.  If the plaintiff had\r\nvoluntarily expended extra time engaged in welding work, and\r\nMaietta knew and approved of such work, the company would have to\r\ncompensate Romn for those hours.  However, we have established\r\nthat the connection between Romn's crew chief activities and any\r\nbenefits to Maietta is too insubstantial to warrant compensation\r\nunder the FLSA.  Therefore, Romn cannot recover for the time he\r\nvolunteered to serve as Michael's crew chief.\r\nC.   State Law Penalties\r\nRomn argues that the trial court erred in failing to\r\ngrant him the remedies set forth in 26 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.  626-A\r\nfor Maietta's violation of  621 of that statute.  We disagree. \r\nAs the trial court noted, \"the FLSA is the exclusive remedy for\r\nenforcement of rights created under the FLSA.\"  Romn, No. 96-256,\r\nslip op. at 7 (citing Tombrello v. USX Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1586383\"><a href=\"/opinion/1586383/tombrello-v-usx-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 544\r\n(N.D. Ala. 1991)).  That is, \"the plaintiff cannot circumvent the\r\nexclusive remedy prescribed by Congress by asserting equivalent\r\nstate claims in addition to the FLSA claim.\"  Tombrello, 763 F.\r\nSupp. at 545.\r\nRomn contends that his claim for relief under  621(1)\r\nhas no FLSA equivalent.  However, our review of the complaint as\r\nwell as the record shows that Romn never raised a claim under that\r\nsubsection.  Instead, Romn sought relief under both the FLSA and\r\n26 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.  664 and 670 for minimum wage and overtime\r\npay violations.  Since Romn received compensation under the FLSA\r\nfor his claims, he cannot recover again under Maine law.\r\nD.   Compensatory Time\r\nRomn contends that the trial court erred in calculating\r\nhis back pay award.  The court ruled that Romn was entitled to the\r\novertime rate of $24 an hour for 120.75 hours of compensatory time. \r\nHowever, it credited Maietta for payment of $16 an hour for 105 of\r\nthese hours.  In effect, the trial court deducted any compensatory\r\ntime payments already made by Maietta to Romn at the regular rate\r\nof pay from the total overtime pay he should have received for\r\nthose held hours.  The plaintiff argues that the trial court erred\r\nin allowing such a deduction.\r\nAs previously mentioned, the FLSA requires employers to\r\ncompensate employees at a rate one and one-half times the regular\r\nrate of pay for any hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. \r\nSee 29 U.S.C.  207(a).  These payments must be made in \"cash or\r\nits equivalent.\"  29 C.F.R.  531.27.  \"Employers and employees may\r\nnot, in general, make agreements to pay and receive less pay than\r\nthe statute provides for.  Such agreements are against public\r\npolicy and unenforceable.\"  See Rudolph v. Metropolitan Airports\r\nComm'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732363\"><a href=\"/opinion/732363/michael-j-rudolph-and-james-a-lindquist-appellantscross-appellees-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 680 (8th Cir. 1996) (citing Barrentine v.\r\nArkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110441\"><a href=\"/opinion/110441/barrentine-v-arkansas-best-freight-system-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981)).  Thus, we\r\nagree with the trial court that Romn is entitled to overtime pay\r\nfor his compensatory time.\r\nWe reject Romn's challenge to the trial court's\r\ncalculation of back pay.  In resolving this issue, we find D'Camerav. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2592932\"><a href=\"/opinion/2592932/dcamera-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 1989), the case\r\ncited by appellee, persuasive.  In D'Camera, the district court\r\nallowed the District of Columbia to deduct compensatory time used\r\nby the plaintiff police officers from an award of back pay.  While\r\nthe district court acknowledged that \"[t]he FLSA does not expressly\r\nauthorize such a deduction, nor does its legislative history offer\r\nany guidance,\"  it found the District of Columbia's calculation to\r\nbe \"fair and permissible under the Act.\"  Id. at 803.  The district\r\ncourt held, and we concur, that \"[p]laintiffs are entitled to be\r\nmade whole, not to a windfall at the [defendant's] expense.\"\r\nThe language of the statute also suggests that we follow\r\nthis course.  Section 216(b) reads, \"[a]ny employer who violates\r\nthe provisions of sections 206 or section 207 of this title shall\r\nbe liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of\r\ntheir . . . unpaid overtime compensation . . . and in an additional\r\nequal amount as liquidated damages.\"  29 U.S.C.  216(b) (emphasis\r\nadded).  Since Romn received partial payment for his overtime\r\nhours, Maietta remains responsible only for the unpaid portion.  We\r\nfind that the trial court's award of liquidated damages adequately\r\ncompensated him for Maietta's violation of the FLSA.  Cf. D'Camera,\r\n722 F. Supp. at 804.  Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's\r\naward of $2,436 plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\r\n              III.  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court's\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law.\r\nCosts to appellee.\n</pre>",
