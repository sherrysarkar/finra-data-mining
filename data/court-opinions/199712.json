After carefully reviewing the briefs\n\nand record on appeal, we affirm the decision below.\n\n           The appellant argues that because the district\n\ncourt neither recited in its order that it had reviewed the\n\nrecord de novo, nor issued its own findings and rulings, we\n\nmust conclude that it erroneously allowed the magistrate to\n\nfinally   decide   the   summary   judgment   motion   without   the\n\nappellant’s consent.      28 U.S.C. § 636 and Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n72.   Nothing in the relevant statute or rule, however,\n\nrequires the court to issue its own findings or explain the\n\nscope of its review.        Elmendorf Graficia, Inc., v. D.S.\n\nAmerica (East), Inc., 48 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           The appellant also argues that summary judgment was\n\nimproper because of a factual dispute concerning whether a\n\nresearcher    properly     invoked    his     right    to   withhold\n\ninformation by objecting to disclosure within the five days\n\nallotted by 45 C.F.R. § 5.65(d)(2).             As the magistrate\n\nstated, however, the date of the researcher’s objection was\n\nirrelevant since the government could itself determine to\n\nwithhold the information under 45 C.F.R. § 5.65(e)(1).\n\f            None of the appellant’s remaining objections rise\n\nto   the   level   of   appellate    argument.
