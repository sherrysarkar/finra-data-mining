Kivlehan, sentenced  as an armed career  offender pursuant\r\n\nto  U.S.S.G.   4B1.4(b)(3)(A), whose  conviction was under 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   922(g)  for, as  a felon, being  in possession  of a\r\n\nfirearm,  appeals for  evidentiary  error;  for  not,  as  an\r\n\nindigent,  being   provided  with  funds  for  a  psychiatric\r\n\nexamination prior to  sentencing; for the court's  refusal to\r\n\nhold a competency hearing, and for  its adding a point to his\r\n\noffense  level  for using  the firearm  in connection  with a\r\n\ncrime of violence.  We affirm.\r\n\n                     Fingerprint Testing\r                                                    \r\n\n          Defendant  was  arrested after  having  alerted his\r\n\nneighbors  by the  noise of  a vigorous  sexual and  physical\r\n\nassault on his  wife.  After receiving consent  to search the\r\n\npremises, the police  found a revolver that  defendant's wife\r\n\nadequately connected with  the incident, post.   Witnesses at\r                                                         \r\n\ntrial   testified  to  the  uniqueness  of  the  revolver,  a\r\n\nspecially  built  competition  pistol,  and  to  having  seen\r\n\ndefendant previously with  his hands on it.   However, it was\r\n\nreturned from  testing for  prints with  none of  defendant's\r\n\nfound.\r\n\n          Over defendant's objection,  a police detective was\r\n\nallowed to  testify that in  his twenty years  experience, it\r\n\nwas \"very  rare\" to  match positively a  known set  of prints\r\n\nwith those  found on a weapon -- in  fact, he could recall no\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ncase.    The  objection  made   was  hearsay.    This  is  an\r\n\ninteresting question.  The witness  was speaking from his own\r\n\nexperience,  but the  effect, perhaps, was  to vouch  for the\r\n\naccuracy of past reports or the testing process itself.\r\n\n          In   any   event,  this   whole   matter  was   not\r\n\nprejudicial.  The revolver had a serial number.  It was noted\r\n\nat the time of the arrest; the revolver at the trial  had the\r\n\nsame  number.  Also, four witnesses positively identified it,\r\n\nincluding  both  its  prior  owner  as  well  as  defendant's\r\n\nbrother,  a professional gunsmith.   Of what  consequence the\r\n\nabsence of fingerprints?   Given such  overwhelming evidence,\r\n\nany  error  in   admitting  the  detective's   testimony  was\r\n\nharmless.  See  United States v. Bartelho, 129  F.3d 663, 670\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1997).    We pass  the question  whether defendant\r\n\nhimself first \"opened the door\" to this testimony.\r\n\n                  Mental Competency Testing\r                                                       \r\n\n          There was  no claim  that defendant  was unable  to\r\n\nstand  trial,  or  that he  had  any  mental defect  defense.\r\n\nHowever, after trial, defendant's counsel asked for funds for\r\n\npsychiatric testing, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.   3006A(e)(1), and\r\n\nlater moved to determine  defendant's competency, pursuant to\r\n\n18  U.S.C.   4241.    His  psychological  condition,  it  was\r\n\nthought,  would be relevant to where  in the applicable range\r\n\nhe  should be sentenced and, also, whether downward departure\r\n\nunder U.S.S.G.    5K2.13 (diminished capacity)  could be had.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nCounsel's most  tangible basis  was the  fact that  defendant\r\n\nwould not  communicate with  him and  rejected all  his mail,\r\n\nreturned  unopened.  Apart  from that were  little fragments,\r\n\nincluding general  comments from defendant's  mother and  his\r\n\nprobation   officer   about   his   apparent,   lay-described\r\n\n\"paranoia,\" and the argument that unless a test was made, how\r\n\ncould it be known that it was not needed?\r\n\n          Whether  to   authorize  funds   for  psychological\r\n\ntesting is within the  trial court's discretion.   Cf. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Mateos-Sanchez,  864 F.2d  232,  239-40 (1st  Cir.\r                                     \r\n\n1988) (investigative  expenses).  Refusal  is not  reversible\r\n\nabsent  clear and  convincing evidence  of  prejudice to  the\r\n\naccused.  See United  States v. Canessa, 644 F.2d 61, 64 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1981).    A determination of competency  may be had when\r\n\nthere is reasonable  cause to believe that the defendant, due\r\n\nto mental  defect,  is unable  to understand  the nature  and\r\n\nconsequences  of the  proceedings against  him  or to  assist\r\n\nproperly in his defense.   See 18 U.S.C.   4241.   To be able\r                                          \r\n\nto  assist  in one's  defense  means  to  have a  \"sufficient\r\n\npresent  ability  to  consult  with  [one's]  lawyer  with  a\r\n\nreasonable degree of rational  understanding.\"  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Lebron, 76  F.3d 29, 31 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied, 116  S.\r                                                                \r\n\nCt. 2537  (1996).   Whether to  hold a    4241  hearing is  a\r\n\nmatter  within the trial  judge's discretion, reviewable only\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nfor abuse.  See United States v. Morgano, 39 F.3d 1358,  1373\r                                                    \r\n\n(7th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1133 (1995).\r                                         \r\n\n          Given  the posture, all  defendant asked  for, with\r\n\nevidence  of  incompetency,  was  a  favorable  exercise   of\r\n\ndiscretion in sentencing.  The court's refusal to  pursue the\r\n\nmatter,  we think, indicates a  disinclination to be any more\r\n\nfavorable than it  was.  Further, the decision  was based, in\r\n\npart, on  observations of  defendant's behavior  during trial\r\n\nand  sentencing.     The  record  expressly  reflects   noted\r\n\ninstances of communication between defendant and  his counsel\r\n\nduring the  latter.   We have  reviewed the  district court's\r\n\nfindings \"comprehensively,\" Lebron,  76 F.3d at 32;  read the\r                                              \r\n\nrecord,   and  listened   to,  in   effect,   testimony  from\r\n\ndefendant's trial counsel, and we think the case  well summed\r\n\nup by the court.\r\n\n          If  I  thought   for  a  minute  that   a\r\n          competency  exam  or a  psychiatric  exam\r\n          would  in any way  flush out any problems\r\n          that may exist or be determinative of any\r\n          issue here, I'd order it, but that's  not\r\n          the case  in the court's  humble opinion.\r\n          And if I  were to order  competency exams\r\n          on   each   one   of   these   sentencing\r\n          proceedings,    there    aren't    enough\r\n          psychiatrists   and    psychologists   to\r\n          accommodate all the competency exams.  It\r\n          is not unusual . . . for defendants, once\r\n          they've gone through trial and are facing\r\n          sentence,   to  develop   all  kinds   of\r\n          anxieties. . . .   [I]t would  be strange\r\n          if  they didn't.  And I think that's what\r\n          we have here, and I'm not  a psychiatrist\r\n          or a  psychologist, but I'm not  going to\r\n          delay  this  matter  any further  on  the\r\n          basis  of  what  I have  before  me  now,\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          unless  someone can  convince me  that it\r\n          would be useful.\r\n\n               And   that,    coupled   with    the\r\n          defendant's  request to  get this  matter\r\n          over with, which is  really what he wants\r\n          to do I  think, that's what I'm  going to\r\n          do.\r\n\nWe find no abuse or prejudice.\r\n\n                        Offense Level\r                                                 \r\n\n          Finally,   defendant  complains   of  the   court's\r\n\nconnecting  the weapon  to the  assault.   The import  of the\r\n\nalleged error was assigning offense level 34 rather  than 33,\r\n\nmaking the applicable sentencing range 262-327 months instead\r\n\nof  235-293.   Under U.S.S.G.    4B1.4(b)(3)(A), the  greater\r\n\nfigure applies if the firearm was \"used or possessed . . . in\r\n\nconnection with a  crime of  violence.\"   It is  acknowledged\r\n\nthat  \"'in connection with' should be interpreted broadly and\r\n\nthat  where a  defendant's possession  of a  firearm aids  or\r\n\nfacilitates the  commission of another offense, the requisite\r\n\nlink is present.\"   United States v.  Thompson, 32 F.3d 1,  7\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (footnote omitted).\r\n\n          Reviewing the district  court's findings for  clear\r\n\nerror,  see United  States v.  Gary,  74 F.3d  304, 317  (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir.),  cert. denied,  116 S.Ct. 2567  (1996), we  find none.\r                                \r\n\nThe   defendant  had  a  history  of  threatening  his  wife,\r\n\nsometimes with firearms.  During the events precipitating his\r\n\narrest,  he placed  the gun  on  the floor  of the  apartment\r\n\nbedroom, openly visible.   He glanced  menacingly at the  gun\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nand then his wife, which she understood to be a threat, as he\r\n\nattempted to have  her facilitate a sexual  encounter between\r\n\nhim and  another woman.   When that failed, he  compelled his\r\n\nwife to endure three hours of sexual and physical abuse, some\r\n\nof which  occurred in the room  with the gun.   He repeatedly\r\n\ntold her  that, in  her words, \"You  probably ain't  going to\r\n\nmake it  through the night.\"  She said  she did not scream or\r\n\ncry out  because she was  scared \"because there was  a loaded\r\n\ngun right beside the bed.\"  It is no stretch to conclude that\r\n\nthe  presence of  the gun  emboldened  the defendant  and, in\r\n\npart, threatened  his victim into  submission, and  therefore\r\n\n\"aid[ed] or facilitat[ed]\" the assault.

We affirm.\r\n\n                     Fingerprint Testing\r                                                    \r\n\n          Defendant  was  arrested after  having  alerted his\r\n\nneighbors  by the  noise of  a vigorous  sexual and  physical\r\n\nassault on his  wife.  After receiving consent  to search the\r\n\npremises, the police  found a revolver that  defendant's wife\r\n\nadequately connected with  the incident, post.   Witnesses at\r                                                         \r\n\ntrial   testified  to  the  uniqueness  of  the  revolver,  a\r\n\nspecially  built  competition  pistol,  and  to  having  seen\r\n\ndefendant previously with  his hands on it.   However, it was\r\n\nreturned from  testing for  prints with  none of  defendant's\r\n\nfound.\r\n\n          Over defendant's objection,  a police detective was\r\n\nallowed to  testify that in  his twenty years  experience, it\r\n\nwas \"very  rare\" to  match positively a  known set  of prints\r\n\nwith those  found on a weapon -- in  fact, he could recall no\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ncase.    The  objection  made   was  hearsay.    This  is  an\r\n\ninteresting question.  The witness  was speaking from his own\r\n\nexperience,  but the  effect, perhaps, was  to vouch  for the\r\n\naccuracy of past reports or the testing process itself.\r\n\n          In   any   event,  this   whole   matter  was   not\r\n\nprejudicial.  The revolver had a serial number.  It was noted\r\n\nat the time of the arrest; the revolver at the trial  had the\r\n\nsame  number.  Also, four witnesses positively identified it,\r\n\nincluding  both  its  prior  owner  as  well  as  defendant's\r\n\nbrother,  a professional gunsmith.   Of what  consequence the\r\n\nabsence of fingerprints?   Given such  overwhelming evidence,\r\n\nany  error  in   admitting  the  detective's   testimony  was\r\n\nharmless.  See  United States v.

His  psychological  condition,  it  was\r\n\nthought,  would be relevant to where  in the applicable range\r\n\nhe  should be sentenced and, also, whether downward departure\r\n\nunder U.S.S.G.    5K2.13 (diminished capacity)  could be had.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nCounsel's most  tangible basis  was the  fact that  defendant\r\n\nwould not  communicate with  him and  rejected all  his mail,\r\n\nreturned  unopened.  Apart  from that were  little fragments,\r\n\nincluding general  comments from defendant's  mother and  his\r\n\nprobation   officer   about   his   apparent,   lay-described\r\n\n\"paranoia,\" and the argument that unless a test was made, how\r\n\ncould it be known that it was not needed?\r\n\n          Whether  to   authorize  funds   for  psychological\r\n\ntesting is within the  trial court's discretion.

The court's refusal to  pursue the\r\n\nmatter,  we think, indicates a  disinclination to be any more\r\n\nfavorable than it  was.  Further, the decision  was based, in\r\n\npart, on  observations of  defendant's behavior  during trial\r\n\nand  sentencing.     The  record  expressly  reflects   noted\r\n\ninstances of communication between defendant and  his counsel\r\n\nduring the  latter.   We have  reviewed the  district court's\r\n\nfindings \"comprehensively,\" Lebron,  76 F.3d at 32;  read the\r                                              \r\n\nrecord,   and  listened   to,  in   effect,   testimony  from\r\n\ndefendant's trial counsel, and we think the case  well summed\r\n\nup by the court.\r\n\n          If  I  thought   for  a  minute  that   a\r\n          competency  exam  or a  psychiatric  exam\r\n          would  in any way  flush out any problems\r\n          that may exist or be determinative of any\r\n          issue here, I'd order it, but that's  not\r\n          the case  in the court's  humble opinion.\r\n          And if I  were to order  competency exams\r\n          on   each   one   of   these   sentencing\r\n          proceedings,    there    aren't    enough\r\n          psychiatrists   and    psychologists   to\r\n          accommodate all the competency exams.  It\r\n          is not unusual . . . for defendants, once\r\n          they've gone through trial and are facing\r\n          sentence,   to  develop   all  kinds   of\r\n          anxieties. . . .

Under U.S.S.G.    4B1.4(b)(3)(A), the  greater\r\n\nfigure applies if the firearm was \"used or possessed . . . in\r\n\nconnection with a  crime of  violence.\"   It is  acknowledged\r\n\nthat  \"'in connection with' should be interpreted broadly and\r\n\nthat  where a  defendant's possession  of a  firearm aids  or\r\n\nfacilitates the  commission of another offense, the requisite\r\n\nlink is present.\"   United States v.
