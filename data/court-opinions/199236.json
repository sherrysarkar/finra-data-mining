Colin Smith, Jr. for appellant.\n     Alan R. Curhan, with whom Burns & Levinson and Gadsby\nHannah, LLP were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                       January 17, 2001\n\f\f             SELYA, Circuit Judge.          Smarting from the sting of a\n\nfailed   business      relationship,     plaintiff-appellant      Donal     B.\n\nBarrett sued his erstwhile co-venturer, Victor J. Lombardi, Jr.,\n\nand    one   of     Lombardi's    companies,    Veritas    Offshore,      Ltd.\n\n(Veritas).        Acting on the defendants' joint dispositive motion,\n\nthe district court determined (1) that it lacked in personam\n\njurisdiction over Veritas, and (2) that, for jurisdictional and\n\nother reasons, the complaint stated no claim against Lombardi\n\nupon which relief could be granted.             Barrett appeals from the\n\norder of dismissal.           We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n             In order to place these appeals into perspective, we\n\nrecount the facts as alleged by the appellant in the operative\n\npleading (the first amended complaint), as supplemented by his\n\naffidavit in opposition to the joint motion to dismiss.\n\n             In    November   1995,   the   appellant    and   Edward   Dyman\n\norganized NetFax, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for the purpose\n\nof developing and commercially exploiting new technologies for\n\nInternet facsimile transmission conceived by Frederick Murphy\n\n(Dyman's     brother-in-law).         Murphy   himself    soon   joined    the\n\nenterprise.        The company established a base of operations in\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts, and installed the appellant as its\n\nchairman.         All the \"founder's stock\" stood in Dyman's name\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f(although the appellant maintains that Dyman held the shares as\n\nhis nominee).\n\n              In short order, Lombardi tried to insinuate himself\n\ninto    the   business,     touting     his   expertise    and    connections.\n\nGulled by Lombardi's rodomontade and eager to bring him into the\n\nfold, the appellant directed Dyman to transfer a substantial\n\nnumber of NetFax shares to Veritas.              These transfers occurred in\n\nMarch 1996 and periodically thereafter, involving an aggregate\n\nof 4,046,666 shares (about 30% of the founder's stock).                 In the\n\nsame general time frame, Dyman also transferred substantial\n\namounts of stock to the appellant and to Murphy, retaining only\n\na token amount for himself.\n\n              The marriage did not go well.          In time, disputes over\n\nhow to manage the affairs of the fledgling company led to the\n\nappellant's ouster as NetFax's chairman.                  Lombardi took his\n\nplace.    That change in command culminated in the execution of a\n\nseparation agreement (the Agreement), dated July 31, 1998.                     In\n\nthe Agreement, Lombardi promised, among other things, to grant\n\nthe    appellant   a     warrant,     expiring    July   31,   2000,   for    the\n\npurchase of 1,000,000 shares of NetFax stock at a price of\n\n$0.001 per share.        The appellant never received the warrant.\n\n              Lombardi's ascension to the throne failed to improve\n\nNetFax's      fortunes    and   the    company    suspended      operations   in\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fSeptember 1998.      Six months later, the appellant went to court.\n\nInvoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), he filed\n\nsuit against Lombardi and Veritas in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts.\n\n             The appellant's first amended complaint contains five\n\nstatements of claim.        The first four charge federal securities\n\nfraud, deceptive trade practices, common law deceit, and common\n\nlaw misrepresentation, respectively.          All of these counts derive\n\nfrom falsehoods attributed to Lombardi, including exaggerations\n\nabout his supposed expertise and his failure to disclose his\n\ncheckered financial past (a history that, as the appellant\n\nbelatedly learned, involved a number of questionable stock deals\n\nand a personal bankruptcy).           The fifth statement of claim,\n\nsounding in contract, concerns Lombardi's refusal to deliver the\n\nwarrant.\n\n             The defendants denied the material averments of the\n\ncomplaint and, in due course, filed a motion to dismiss.                     The\n\ndistrict     court    determined     that     it    lacked      in   personam\n\njurisdiction over Veritas; that, in all events, the appellant's\n\nfirst four counts were vulnerable because he was not the real\n\nparty   in    interest    (Dyman,   after    all,    had     transferred     the\n\nshares);     and   that   those   counts    also    failed    because   of    an\n\ninsufficient showing of damages.             These determinations left\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fstanding only the breach of contract claim (count five).     As to\n\nthat cause of action, the court focused on the price to be paid\n\nfor the underlying stock — 1,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share\n\n— and, by a process of simple multiplication, ascertained that\n\nthe dispute involved only $1,000.      Starting from that premise,\n\nthe court ruled that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction by\n\nreason of an inadequate amount in controversy.\n\n            Having disposed of all the appellant's claims, the\n\ncourt granted the motion to dismiss and entered judgment in the\n\ndefendants' favor.    The appellant then moved unsuccessfully for\n\nrelief from the judgment.     The district court denied that motion\n\nout of hand.     These appeals — one taken upon the initial entry\n\nof judgment and the second upon the denial of reconsideration —\n\nfollowed.\n\nII.   CLAIMS AGAINST VERITAS\n\n            In our view, efficient resolution of the claims against\n\nVeritas does not require us to go beyond the district court's\n\ndetermination that it lacked in personam jurisdiction over that\n\ndefendant.     We confine our discussion accordingly.\n\n                     A.   The Motion to Dismiss.\n\n            Veritas is a foreign corporation headquartered in the\n\nCayman Islands.     Since there is no evidence that it regularly\n\nconducts business in Massachusetts, the appellant must establish\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fa   basis   for    the    exercise    of     specific    jurisdiction.          See\n\nDonatelli v. Nat'l Hockey League, 893 F.2d 459, 462-63 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (elucidating concepts of \"general\" and \"specific\" personal\n\njurisdiction, and distinguishing between them).                 To achieve this\n\ngoal, the appellant must present sufficient facts to satisfy two\n\ncornerstone conditions:            \"first, that the forum in which the\n\nfederal district court sits has a long-arm statute that purports\n\nto grant jurisdiction over the defendant; and second, that the\n\nexercise of jurisdiction pursuant to that statute comports with\n\nthe strictures of the Constitution.\"             Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d\n\n53, 60 (1st Cir. 1994).              In this case, then, the appellant\n\ncannot   hale     Veritas   into     the   district     court    unless    he   can\n\nsatisfy the rigors of both the Massachusetts long-arm statute\n\nand the United States Constitution.\n\n            Compliance      with     the    state   standard      for     personal\n\njurisdiction necessitates a showing that the cause of action\n\narises   from     the    defendant's       \"transacting    any    business\"     in\n\nMassachusetts, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, § 3(a), or from a\n\ntortious in-state \"act or omission,\" id. § 3(c).                        Compliance\n\nwith the federal constitutional standard involves a somewhat\n\nmore extensive showing.        That showing has three aspects:\n\n            First, the claim underlying the litigation\n            must directly arise out of, or relate to,\n            the  defendant's  forum-state  activities.\n            Second, the defendant's in-state contacts\n\n                                       -7-\n\f             must represent a purposeful availment of the\n             privilege of conducting activities in the\n             forum state, thereby invoking the benefits\n             and protections of that state's laws and\n             making the defendant's involuntary presence\n             before the state's courts foreseeable.\n             Third, the exercise of jurisdiction must, in\n             light of the Gestalt factors, be reasonable.\n\nUnited Elec., Radio & Mach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp.,\n\n960 F.2d 1080, 1089 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n             We have developed a taxonomy that provides a variable\n\nset of guidelines, each corresponding to a particular level of\n\nanalysis, for use when a trial court adjudicates a motion to\n\ndismiss for want of personal jurisdiction.             See Foster-Miller,\n\nInc. v. Babcock & Wilcox Can., 46 F.3d 138, 145-47 (1st Cir.\n\n1995); Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., 967 F.2d 671, 674-78 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).      The most conventional of these methods — and the\n\none   that    applies   here    —   authorizes   the   district   court   to\n\nrestrict its inquiry to whether the plaintiff has proffered\n\nevidence which, if credited, suffices to support a finding of\n\npersonal jurisdiction.         Rodriguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp., 115\n\nF.3d 81, 83-84 (1st Cir. 1997); Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145.\n\n             To make this prima facie showing, the plaintiff cannot\n\nrest upon mere averments, but must adduce competent evidence of\n\nspecific facts.     Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145; Boit, 967 F.2d\n\nat 675.      When he does so, the court must accept the proffer at\n\nface value.      Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145.           Determining the\n\n                                      -8-\n\fadequacy     of   this    prima     facie       jurisdictional     showing    is    a\n\nquintessentially legal determination — a determination which, on\n\nappeal, engenders de novo review.                 Rodriguez, 115 F.3d at 84.\n\n             In   the    circumstances          at   bar,   the   district    court\n\ncorrectly found the appellant's proffer wanting.                   The appellant\n\nfailed even to allege — let alone offer competent proof — that\n\nVeritas had conducted any business in Massachusetts or that it\n\nhad any significant ties to the state.                 Indeed, the appellant's\n\nonly mention of Veritas in either his amended complaint or in\n\nhis affidavit in opposition to the motion to dismiss indicated\n\nthat Veritas was the transferee and holder of the NetFax shares,\n\nand that he believed it to be owned and managed by Lombardi.\n\nThe mere acceptance of shares transferred from within the forum\n\nstate, without more, does not constitute a minimum contact\n\nsufficient to subject a foreign corporation to jurisdiction in\n\nthat state's courts.          E.g., Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186,\n\n216   (1977).       Nor    will     the     fact     that   the   transferee       is\n\nbeneficially owned or controlled by a person or entity who does\n\nbusiness in the forum state suffice to tip the jurisdictional\n\nbalance.     See Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770,\n\n781   n.13    (1984)      (\"[N]or    does       jurisdiction      over   a   parent\n\ncorporation automatically establish jurisdiction over a wholly\n\nowned subsidiary.\"); Cent. States, S.E. & S.W. Areas Pension\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fFund v. Reimer Express World Corp., 230 F.3d 934, 944 (7th Cir.\n\n2000) (similar).\n\n            In the face of these powerful precedents, the appellant\n\nattempts to bolster his position by noting that his opposition\n\nto the motion to dismiss portrayed Lombardi as an agent of\n\nVeritas     (so    that        business      transacted      by        Lombardi     in\n\nMassachusetts could be attributed to Veritas).                         This attempt\n\nfizzles.    In order to defeat a motion to dismiss for want of in\n\npersonam jurisdiction, a plaintiff must do more than simply\n\nsurmise the existence of a favorable factual scenario; he must\n\nverify    the   facts     alleged     through    materials        of    evidentiary\n\nquality.    See Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145; Boit, 967 F.2d at\n\n675.   Thus, allegations in a lawyer's brief or legal memorandum\n\nare insufficient, even under the relatively relaxed prima facie\n\nstandard, to establish jurisdictional facts.                      Cf. Fragoso v.\n\nLopez,    991   F.2d    878,    887   (1st    Cir.   1993)   (explaining          that\n\nstatements in a brief are not adequate to forestall summary\n\njudgment); Kelly v. United States, 924 F.2d 355, 357 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (similar).\n\n            That ends this aspect of the matter.                        Because the\n\nappellant placed insufficient facts before the district court to\n\nsatisfy the minimum requirements for the exercise of personal\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fjurisdiction, the court appropriately granted Veritas's motion\n\nto dismiss.\n\n              B.   The Motion for Relief from Judgment.\n\n            Following the district court's order of dismissal, the\n\nappellant moved for relief from judgment.1    He submitted with the\n\nmotion a new affidavit asserting that Veritas was subject to in\n\npersonam jurisdiction in Massachusetts because it functioned as\n\nLombardi's \"alter ego.\"     The appellant posits that this neoteric\n\nsubmission bridged the jurisdictional gap, and that the district\n\ncourt therefore should have vacated its order of dismissal.     He\n\nis wrong.\n\n            A motion for relief from judgment cannot be used merely\n\nto reargue a point already decided.      See Cody, Inc. v. Town of\n\nWoodbury, 179 F.3d 52, 56 (2d Cir. 1999); Cashner v. Freedom\n\nStores, Inc., 98 F.3d 572, 577 (10th Cir. 1996).    Given the lack\n\nof exceptional circumstances justifying extraordinary relief\n\nunder subsection (6) of Rule 60(b), Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118\n\n\n    1 To be precise, the appellant filed a motion seeking (1)\n\"reconsideration of the [district] court's judgment dated\nFebruary 23, 2000,\" or (2) \"to alter or amend [that] judgment,\"\nor (3) \"reconsideration under Rule 60(b).\" We do not spend any\ntime on the first two options. After all, new matters cannot be\nasserted as of right on a motion for reconsideration, Appeal of\nSun Pipe Line Co., 831 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 1987), and the ten-\nday window for filing motions to alter or amend, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n59(e), had closed by the time that the appellant filed his\nmotion. Accordingly, we treat the appellant's motion, favorably\nto him, as one filed under Rule 60(b).\n\n                                 -11-\n\fF.3d 886, 891 (1st Cir. 1997), the appellant's cryptic motion in\n\nthis case necessarily invoked subsection (1) of Rule 60(b).\n\nThat subsection permits a court to relieve a party from a final\n\njudgment on the ground of \"mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or\n\nexcusable neglect.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).       The second\n\naffidavit, however, includes nothing that indicates why the\n\ninformation that it contains was omitted from the appellant's\n\nfirst affidavit.   This brings the appellant's case within the\n\nambit of our holding in Mas Marques v. Digital Equipment Corp.,\n\n637 F.2d 24 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n         In Mas Marques, as here, the plaintiff filed a motion\n\nand affidavit after the entry of judgment.    Id. at 28.   There,\n\nas here, the late affidavit contained no explanation for the\n\nplaintiff's failure to submit the critical information to the\n\ncourt at an earlier date.      Id. at 29.    There, as here, the\n\nplaintiff made no assertion that further facts became known to\n\nhim only after judgment had been entered.      Id.   Given those\n\nomissions, the district court concluded that the tardy affidavit\n\ndid not warrant relief under Rule 60(b).    We agreed, stating:\n\n         In these circumstances, particularly where\n         [the plaintiff] should have been aware of\n         the deficiencies in his case before the\n         entry of judgment, relief under Rule 60(b)\n         would not have been justified. . . .      A\n         defeated  litigant   cannot  set   aside  a\n         judgment . . . because he failed to present\n         on a motion for summary judgment all of the\n\n                               -12-\n\f            facts known to him that             might    have    been\n            useful to the court.\n\nId. at 29-30 (citations, internal quotation marks, and emphasis\n\nomitted).\n\n            Mas Marques controls here.           Because the appellant has\n\ngiven no acceptable reason for the delay in presenting the\n\nsecond affidavit to the district court, we cannot say that the\n\ncourt    abused   its       discretion     in   refusing       to     reopen    the\n\njurisdictional question.         See 12 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's\n\nFederal    Practice     ¶    60.41[1][c][ii]     (3d     ed.    1999)    (\"Courts\n\nrepeatedly     deny   relief     when    they   find    that    the     facts   and\n\ncircumstances demonstrate a lack of diligence in pursuing . . .\n\nlitigation.\").\n\n            The appellant strives to avoid this result in two ways.\n\nFirst, he asks for leniency on the basis that he originally\n\nfiled suit pro se.          This request seems disingenuous.            While pro\n\nse litigants sometimes are accorded a measure of latitude in\n\nprocedural matters, e.g., Instituto de Educacion Universal Corp.\n\nv. United States Dep't of Educ., 209 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir.\n\n2000),    no   such   latitude     is    warranted     where,    as     here,   the\n\nunrepresented party is himself a lawyer.2               Godlove v. Bamberger,\n\n\n\n    2The appellant is a Harvard-trained attorney admitted to the\nbars of New York, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia.\nHe has practiced securities law for some thirty-five years.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fForeman, Oswald & Hahn, 903 F.2d 1145, 1148 (7th Cir. 1990).\n\nAnd at any rate, by the time the motion to dismiss was argued,\n\nthe appellant had retained counsel who appeared on his behalf.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the appellant is not entitled to any\n\nspecial solicitude.\n\n              The appellant's second initiative consists of a plea,\n\nmade in his Rule 60(b) motion, that the district court ought not\n\nto   have     dismissed     the    complaint     without       affording        him    the\n\nopportunity to conduct discovery about Veritas and its business\n\nactivities.          This    plea      lacks    merit.         If     a    party    needs\n\njurisdictional        discovery,        that    party    has     an       obligation    to\n\nrequest it in a timely manner.                   Rodriguez, 115 F.3d at 86;\n\nWhittaker Corp. v. United Aircraft Corp., 482 F.2d 1079, 1086\n\n(1st       Cir.   1973).         The   appellant     failed      to       fulfill     this\n\nobligation:         to     the    contrary,     he   did   not      seek     additional\n\ndiscovery at any time prior to the entry of an adverse judgment.\n\nThis was plainly too late. 3               See Rodriguez, 115 F.3d at 86.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n     The appellant's dilatoriness is all the more striking\nbecause ample opportunity for discovery existed prior to the\nlower court's ruling. The original complaint was filed by the\nplaintiff on March 29, 1999; the defendants' joint motion was\nfiled on September 9, 1999; and the district court rendered its\ndecision on February 23, 2000.\n\n                                         -14-\n\fConsequently, we cannot fault the district court for denying the\n\nmotion for relief from judgment.4\n\nIII.       THE CLAIMS AGAINST LOMBARDI\n\n              Our    conclusion          that       the     district      court   lacked\n\njurisdiction        over    Veritas,          see   supra    Part    II,    impacts    the\n\nappellant's other claims as well.                    That holding leaves Lombardi\n\nas the sole defendant.                Personal jurisdiction over him is not a\n\nproblem.       The district court found, preliminarily, that it had\n\nsuch       jurisdiction,        and    Lombardi      does    not    now    contest    that\n\nfinding.       We return, then, to the claims limned in the amended\n\ncomplaint.\n\n                           A.    The First Four Counts.\n\n              As to the first four counts of the amended complaint,\n\nthe    appellant     has        thus    far    sought       rescission      —   and   only\n\nrescission — as a remedy.                The district court highlighted this\n\nnarrow focus, observing that these counts \"contain[] no explicit\n\nstatement of harm or loss.\"                   The appellant's brief on appeal\n\nlikewise emphasizes this focus, and his counsel twice reaffirmed\n\nat oral argument in this court that rescission was the goal of\n\n\n\n       4\n     Given this holding, we need not evaluate whether the\nadditional facts contained in the second affidavit, if\nseasonably placed before the court, would have made a\ndispositive difference on the jurisdictional question. We do\nnote, however, that the contents of that affidavit appear more\nconclusory than factual.\n\n                                           -15-\n\fthe first four counts.           Finally, the appellant presented no\n\ndeveloped argumentation in support of a claim for money damages\n\nin either the district court or this court.5            Thus, no claim for\n\nmoney damages is properly in the case at this juncture.                        See\n\nGooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 515 (1st Cir. 1988)\n\n(discussing     pleader's       obligation    to   allege     \"each     material\n\nelement necessary to sustain recovery\").\n\n            Nor are the first four counts viable in respect to the\n\nprayer for rescission.        When a party seeks to rescind a contract\n\nfor the transfer of property, a court ordinarily can enforce\n\nrescission     only    as   between    the   party    who    surrendered       the\n\nproperty (or persons claiming by, through, or under that party)\n\nand   the   party     who   holds   the   property.         Here,   Dyman     (who\n\ndelivered the disputed stock) is not a party, and Veritas (which\n\nnow holds the stock) is not properly before the court.                  To cinch\n\nmatters, none of the counts in question either state facts\n\nsufficient to place the appellant in Dyman's shoes or delineate\n\nany   theory   under    which    rescission    might   be     ordered    in    the\n\n\n\n      5\n     Although the prayer for relief inscribed at the tail end of\nthe amended complaint made a passing reference to money damages\nregarding one of the four counts, the appellant did not pursue\nthis vague allusion either here or below.     Consequently, the\naverment lacks the capacity to transform the character of the\nfirst four counts. See Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\nCir. 1996) (deeming waived an allegation made by the plaintiff\nin the trial court but not thereafter pressed).\n\n                                      -16-\n\fabsence    of     both    the       transferor      and    the     transferee. 6\n\nConsequently, the district court's decision to dismiss the first\n\nfour counts of the amended complaint in their entirety passes\n\nmuster.\n\n           Before    leaving        this   topic,   we    hasten    to   add   an\n\nacknowledgment that, even without Dyman and Veritas in the case,\n\nsome claim theoretically might lie on the appellant's behalf\n\nwithin the framework of the first four counts of the amended\n\ncomplaint.      Thus, we do not foreclose the possibility that, on\n\nremand, the district court, in its discretion, might yet permit\n\nthe complaint to be further amended.             We do not pursue the point\n\nfor we must deal with matters as they were when the trial court\n\nruled, not with matters as they might become.\n\n                               B.    Count Five.\n\n           Count five is a different kettle of fish.                That count\n\nembodies   a    claim    for    specific     performance    of     the   warrant\n\nprovision of the Agreement executed in connection with the\n\nappellant's removal as NetFax's guiding light.                   The pertinent\n\nprovision states that Lombardi \"shall grant to Mr. Barrett a\n\nwarrant to acquire One Million (1,000,000) shares of [NetFax's]\n\n\n\n    6Indeed,  the   appellant  apparently  recognizes  this\nshortcoming.  See Appellant's Brief at 32 (indicating that\n\"Veritas has to be before the Court\" in order to effectuate\nrescission).\n\n                                      -17-\n\fcommon stock . . . at an exercise price of $.001 per share.\"\n\nThe appellant alleges that Lombardi never delivered the warrant\n\nand seeks specific performance of this covenant.\n\n           The district court ruled that it did not have subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction over this count because \"the total contract\n\nprice is $1,000,\" and \"that amount . . . clearly falls short of\n\nthe   $75,000     minimum   amount    in    controversy     required\"    as    a\n\nprecondition for federal diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1332(a).   We review this determination de novo.            Bull HN Info.\n\nSys., Inc. v. Hutson, 229 F.3d 321, 328 (1st Cir. 2000); Allen\n\nv. R & H Oil & Gas Co., 63 F.3d 1326, 1336 (5th Cir. 1995).                   We\n\nconclude   that    the   district    court    erred   by   focusing     on   the\n\nexercise price for the shares rather than the value of the\n\nwarrant itself.\n\n           The Supreme Court erected the framework for determining\n\nwhether a cause of action satisfies the jurisdictional minimum\n\nin St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283\n\n(1938).    The Court laid down a general rule to the effect that\n\nthe amount specified by the plaintiff controls, as long as that\n\namount is asserted in good faith.            Id. at 288.     Hence, a court\n\ncan   dismiss   an   action   for    insufficiency     of    the   amount     in\n\ncontroversy only when, \"from the face of the pleadings, it is\n\napparent, to a legal certainty, . . . that the plaintiff never\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fwas entitled to recover\" a sum equal to, or in excess of, the\n\njurisdictional minimum.   Id. at 289.   On this record, we do not\n\nbelieve that the district court supportably could say to a legal\n\ncertainty that the appellant was not entitled to recover more\n\nthan $75,000 (or property worth more than that amount) under\n\ncount five.   We explain briefly.\n\n          As said, count five involves a warrant to acquire\n\n1,000,000 shares of stock at an exercise price of $.001 per\n\nshare.   The value of a warrant is typically the difference\n\nbetween the market value (during the currency of the warrant\n\nperiod) of the shares to which the warrant pertains and the\n\nexercise price payable for those shares.      See, e.g., Niagara\n\nHudson Power Corp. v. Leventritt, 340 U.S. 336, 343-44 (1951);\n\nCustom Chrome, Inc. v. Comm'r, 217 F.3d 1117, 1125 (9th Cir.\n\n2000); SEC v. Warde, 151 F.3d 42, 46 n.1 (2d Cir. 1998); Swiss\n\nBank Corp. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 141 F.3d 689, 691 (7th Cir.\n\n1998).   In his first affidavit, dated October 11, 1999, the\n\nappellant estimated the value of NetFax's patented technology at\n\nsomewhere between $10,000,000 and $100,000,000, and the market\n\nvalue of NetFax stock at somewhere between $0.34 and $2.26 per\n\nshare.   Even taking the low-end valuation, the shares to which\n\nthe warrant pertained theoretically were worth $340,000 at that\n\npoint.   On this set of assumptions, the value of the warrant\n\n\n                              -19-\n\f(the spread between market value and exercise price) would have\n\nbeen   $339,000.          This    is    a    sum    well     above    the    requisite\n\njurisdictional minimum.\n\n            We    recognize,       of   course,       that    the    party   invoking\n\njurisdiction has the burden to show that it is proper.                           E.g.,\n\nViqueira v. First Bank, 140 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).                         In an\n\namount-in-controversy case, however, all the plaintiff must do\n\nto carry this burden in the face of a motion to dismiss is to\n\nset forth facts which, if true, would prevent the trier from\n\nconcluding to a legal certainty that the potential recovery is\n\ncapped at a figure below the jurisdictional minimum.                         See Dep't\n\nof Recreation & Sports v. World Boxing Ass'n, 942 F.2d 84, 88\n\n(1st   Cir.      1991).        Here,        the    appellant    did    supply     some\n\ninformation bearing on the value of the warrant, and Lombardi\n\nproffered     nothing     to     contradict        these   figures     or    otherwise\n\nestablish that the appellant, even if successful in recovering\n\nthe property (the warrant), would wind up with a prize worth\n\nless than $75,000.         We do not think that the district court, on\n\nthis bareboned record and without conducting an evidentiary\n\nhearing, could simply brush aside the appellant's estimates as\n\n\"based entirely on speculation\" and declare to a legal certainty\n\nthat the warrant was worth less than the required jurisdictional\n\n\n\n\n                                            -20-\n\famount.     For this reason, we hold that the district court erred\n\nin dismissing count five of the amended complaint.7\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n             We need go no further.           For the reasons stated, we\n\nsustain the determination that Veritas was not properly before\n\nthe court and, accordingly, we affirm so much of the lower\n\ncourt's     order   as     dismissed,     without   prejudice,    the   claims\n\nagainst Veritas.         We also affirm the district court's dismissal\n\nof    the   first   four    counts   of    the   amended   complaint    as   to\n\nLombardi.     We hold, however, that the court erred in concluding\n\non this meager record that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nover the fifth count of the amended complaint.                   We therefore\n\nreverse so much of the order of dismissal as pertains to that\n\ncount and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.                No costs.\n\n\n\n\n       7\n     There is a wrinkle here. According to the terms of the\nAgreement, the warrant expired during the pendency of this\nappeal. We leave the legal significance (if any) of this new\ndevelopment to the parties and the district court.\n\n                                     -21-\n\f",

Barrett sued his erstwhile co-venturer, Victor J. Lombardi, Jr., and one of Lombardi's companies, Veritas Offshore, Ltd. (Veritas). Acting on the defendants' joint dispositive motion, the district court determined (1) that it lacked in personam jurisdiction over Veritas, and (2) that, for jurisdictional and other reasons, the complaint stated no claim against Lombardi upon which relief could be granted. Barrett appeals from the order of dismissal. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to place these appeals into perspective, we recount the facts as alleged by the appellant in the operative pleading (the first amended complaint), as supplemented by his affidavit in opposition to the joint motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1995, the appellant and Edward Dyman organized NetFax, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for the purpose of developing and commercially exploiting new technologies for Internet facsimile transmission conceived by Frederick Murphy (Dyman's brother-in-law). Murphy himself soon joined the enterprise. The company established a base of operations in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and installed the appellant as its chairman. All the \"founder's stock\" stood in Dyman's name (although the appellant maintains that Dyman held the shares as his nominee).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short order, Lombardi tried to insinuate himself into the business, touting his expertise and connections. Gulled by Lombardi's rodomontade and eager to bring him into the fold, the appellant directed Dyman to transfer a substantial number of NetFax shares to Veritas. These transfers occurred in March 1996 and periodically thereafter, involving an aggregate of 4,046,666 shares (about 30% of the founder's stock). In the same general time frame, Dyman also transferred substantial amounts of stock to the appellant and to Murphy, retaining only a token amount for himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The marriage did not go well. In time, disputes over how to manage the affairs of the fledgling company led to the appellant's ouster as NetFax's chairman. Lombardi took his place. That change in command culminated in the execution of a separation agreement (the Agreement), dated July 31, 1998. In the Agreement, Lombardi promised, among other things, to grant the appellant a warrant, expiring July 31, 2000, for the purchase of 1,000,000 shares of NetFax stock at a price of $0.001 per share. The appellant never received the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombardi's ascension to the throne failed to improve NetFax's fortunes and the company suspended operations in September 1998. Six months later, the appellant went to court. Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), he filed suit against Lombardi and Veritas in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's first amended complaint contains five statements of claim. The first four charge federal securities fraud, deceptive trade practices, common law deceit, and common law misrepresentation, respectively. All of these counts derive from falsehoods attributed to Lombardi, including exaggerations about his supposed expertise and his failure to disclose his checkered financial past (a history that, as the appellant belatedly learned, involved a number of questionable stock deals and a personal bankruptcy). The fifth statement of claim, sounding in contract, concerns Lombardi's refusal to deliver the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants denied the material averments of the complaint and, in due course, filed a motion to dismiss. The district court determined that it lacked in personam jurisdiction over Veritas; that, in all events, the appellant's first four counts were vulnerable because he was not the real party in interest (Dyman, after all, had transferred the shares); and that those counts also failed because of an insufficient showing of damages. These determinations left standing only the breach of contract claim (count five). As to that cause of action, the court focused on the price to be paid for the underlying stock -- 1,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share -- and, by a process of simple multiplication, ascertained that the dispute involved only $1,000. Starting from that premise, the court ruled that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction by reason of an inadequate amount in controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having disposed of all the appellant's claims, the court granted the motion to dismiss and entered judgment in the defendants' favor. The appellant then moved unsuccessfully for relief from the judgment. The district court denied that motion out of hand. These appeals -- one taken upon the initial entry of judgment and the second upon the denial of reconsideration -- followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. CLAIMS AGAINST VERITAS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, efficient resolution of the claims against Veritas does not require us to go beyond the district court's determination that it lacked in personam jurisdiction over that defendant. We confine our discussion accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Veritas is a foreign corporation headquartered in the Cayman Islands. Since there is no evidence that it regularly conducts business in Massachusetts, the appellant must establish a basis for the exercise of specific jurisdiction. SeeDonatelli v. Nat'l Hockey League, 893 F.2d 459, 462-63 (1st Cir. 1990) (elucidating concepts of \"general\" and \"specific\" personal jurisdiction, and distinguishing between them). To achieve this goal, the appellant must present sufficient facts to satisfy two cornerstone conditions: \"first, that the forum in which the federal district court sits has a long-arm statute that purports to grant jurisdiction over the defendant; and second, that the exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to that statute comports with the strictures of the Constitution.\" Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir. 1994). In this case, then, the appellant cannot hale Veritas into the district court unless he can satisfy the rigors of both the Massachusetts long-arm statute and the United States Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Compliance with the state standard for personal jurisdiction necessitates a showing that the cause of action arises from the defendant's \"transacting any business\" in Massachusetts, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, &#167; 3(a), or from a tortious in-state \"act or omission,\" id. &#167; 3(c). Compliance with the federal constitutional standard involves a somewhat more extensive showing. That showing has three aspects:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the claim underlying the litigation must directly arise out of, or relate to, the defendant's forum-state activities. Second, the defendant's in-state contacts must represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that state's laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before the state's courts foreseeable. Third, the exercise of jurisdiction must, in light of the Gestalt factors, be reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach.

See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Can., 46 F.3d 138, 145-47 (1st Cir. 1995); Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., 967 F.2d 671, 674-78 (1st Cir. 1992). The most conventional of these methods -- and the one that applies here -- authorizes the district court to restrict its inquiry to whether the plaintiff has proffered evidence which, if credited, suffices to support a finding of personal jurisdiction. Rodriguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp., 115 F.3d 81, 83-84 (1st Cir. 1997); Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make this prima facie showing, the plaintiff cannot rest upon mere averments, but must adduce competent evidence of specific facts. Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145; Boit, 967 F.2d at 675. When he does so, the court must accept the proffer at face value. Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145. Determining the adequacy of this prima facie jurisdictional showing is a quintessentially legal determination -- a determination which, on appeal, engenders de novo review. Rodriguez, 115 F.3d at 84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the circumstances at bar, the district court correctly found the appellant's proffer wanting. The appellant failed even to allege -- let alone offer competent proof -- that Veritas had conducted any business in Massachusetts or that it had any significant ties to the state. Indeed, the appellant's only mention of Veritas in either his amended complaint or in his affidavit in opposition to the motion to dismiss indicated that Veritas was the transferee and holder of the NetFax shares, and that he believed it to be owned and managed by Lombardi. The mere acceptance of shares transferred from within the forum state, without more, does not constitute a minimum contact sufficient to subject a foreign corporation to jurisdiction in that state's courts. E.g., Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 216 (1977). Nor will the fact that the transferee is beneficially owned or controlled by a person or entity who does business in the forum state suffice to tip the jurisdictional balance. See Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 781 n.13 (1984) (\"[N]or does jurisdiction over a parent corporation automatically establish jurisdiction over a wholly owned subsidiary.\"); Cent. States, S.E. &amp; S.W. Areas Pension Fund v. Reimer Express World Corp., 230 F.3d 934, 944 (7th Cir. 2000) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of these powerful precedents, the appellant attempts to bolster his position by noting that his opposition to the motion to dismiss portrayed Lombardi as an agent of Veritas (so that business transacted by Lombardi in Massachusetts could be attributed to Veritas). This attempt fizzles. In order to defeat a motion to dismiss for want of inpersonam jurisdiction, a plaintiff must do more than simply surmise the existence of a favorable factual scenario; he must verify the facts alleged through materials of evidentiary quality. See Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145; Boit, 967 F.2d at 675. Thus, allegations in a lawyer's brief or legal memorandum are insufficient, even under the relatively relaxed prima facie standard, to establish jurisdictional facts. Cf. Fragoso v. Lopez, 991 F.2d 878, 887 (1st Cir. 1993) (explaining that statements in a brief are not adequate to forestall summary judgment); Kelly v. United States, 924 F.2d 355, 357 (1st Cir. 1991) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Because the appellant placed insufficient facts before the district court to satisfy the minimum requirements for the exercise of personal jurisdiction, the court appropriately granted Veritas's motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Motion for Relief from Judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the district court's order of dismissal, the appellant moved for relief from judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> He submitted with the motion a new affidavit asserting that Veritas was subject to inpersonam jurisdiction in Massachusetts because it functioned as Lombardi's \"alter ego.\" The appellant posits that this neoteric submission bridged the jurisdictional gap, and that the district court therefore should have vacated its order of dismissal. He is wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion for relief from judgment cannot be used merely to reargue a point already decided. See Cody, Inc. v. Town of Woodbury, 179 F.3d 52, 56 (2d Cir. 1999); Cashner v. Freedom Stores, Inc., 98 F.3d 572, 577 (10th Cir. 1996). Given the lack of exceptional circumstances justifying extraordinary relief under subsection (6) of Rule 60(b), Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 891 (1st Cir. 1997), the appellant's cryptic motion in this case necessarily invoked subsection (1) of Rule 60(b). That subsection permits a court to relieve a party from a final judgment on the ground of \"mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1). The second affidavit, however, includes nothing that indicates why the information that it contains was omitted from the appellant's first affidavit. This brings the appellant's case within the ambit of our holding in Mas Marques v. Digital Equipment Corp., 637 F.2d 24 (1st Cir. 1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Mas Marques, as here, the plaintiff filed a motion and affidavit after the entry of judgment. Id. at 28. There, as here, the late affidavit contained no explanation for the plaintiff's failure to submit the critical information to the court at an earlier date. Id. at 29. There, as here, the plaintiff made no assertion that further facts became known to him only after judgment had been entered. Id. Given those omissions, the district court concluded that the tardy affidavit did not warrant relief under Rule 60(b). We agreed, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances, particularly where [the plaintiff] should have been aware of the deficiencies in his case before the entry of judgment, relief under Rule 60(b) would not have been justified. . . . A defeated litigant cannot set aside a judgment . . . because he failed to present on a motion for summary judgment all of the facts known to him that might have been useful to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 29-30 (citations, internal quotation marks, and emphasis omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mas Marques controls here. Because the appellant has given no acceptable reason for the delay in presenting the second affidavit to the district court, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in refusing to reopen the jurisdictional question. See 12 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 60.41[1][c][ii] (3d ed. 1999) (\"Courts repeatedly deny relief when they find that the facts and circumstances demonstrate a lack of diligence in pursuing . . . litigation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant strives to avoid this result in two ways. First, he asks for leniency on the basis that he originally filed suit pro se. This request seems disingenuous. While pro se litigants sometimes are accorded a measure of latitude in procedural matters, e.g., Instituto de Educacion Universal Corp. v. United States Dep't of Educ., 209 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 2000), no such latitude is warranted where, as here, the unrepresented party is himself a lawyer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Godlove v. Bamberger, Foreman, Oswald &amp; Hahn, 903 F.2d 1145, 1148 (7th Cir. 1990). And at any rate, by the time the motion to dismiss was argued, the appellant had retained counsel who appeared on his behalf. Under the circumstances, the appellant is not entitled to any special solicitude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's second initiative consists of a plea, made in his Rule 60(b) motion, that the district court ought not to have dismissed the complaint without affording him the opportunity to conduct discovery about Veritas and its business activities. This plea lacks merit. If a party needs jurisdictional discovery, that party has an obligation to request it in a timely manner. Rodriguez, 115 F.3d at 86; Whittaker Corp. v. United Aircraft Corp., 482 F.2d 1079, 1086 (1st Cir. 1973). The appellant failed to fulfill this obligation: to the contrary, he did not seek additional discovery at any time prior to the entry of an adverse judgment. This was plainly too late.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See Rodriguez, 115 F.3d at 86. Consequently, we cannot fault the district court for denying the motion for relief from judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE CLAIMS AGAINST LOMBARDI</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Veritas, see supra Part II, impacts the appellant's other claims as well. That holding leaves Lombardi as the sole defendant. Personal jurisdiction over him is not a problem. The district court found, preliminarily, that it had such jurisdiction, and Lombardi does not now contest that finding. We return, then, to the claims limned in the amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The First Four Counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first four counts of the amended complaint, the appellant has thus far sought rescission -- and only rescission -- as a remedy. The district court highlighted this narrow focus, observing that these counts \"contain[] no explicit statement of harm or loss.\" The appellant's brief on appeal likewise emphasizes this focus, and his counsel twice reaffirmed at oral argument in this court that rescission was the goal of the first four counts. Finally, the appellant presented no developed argumentation in support of a claim for money damages in either the district court or this court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, no claim for money damages is properly in the case at this juncture. SeeGooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 515 (1st Cir. 1988) (discussing pleader's obligation to allege \"each material element necessary to sustain recovery\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are the first four counts viable in respect to the prayer for rescission. When a party seeks to rescind a contract for the transfer of property, a court ordinarily can enforce rescission only as between the party who surrendered the property (or persons claiming by, through, or under that party) and the party who holds the property. Here, Dyman (who delivered the disputed stock) is not a party, and Veritas (which now holds the stock) is not properly before the court. To cinch matters, none of the counts in question either state facts sufficient to place the appellant in Dyman's shoes or delineate any theory under which rescission might be ordered in the absence of both the transferor and the transferee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Consequently, the district court's decision to dismiss the first four counts of the amended complaint in their entirety passes muster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before leaving this topic, we hasten to add an acknowledgment that, even without Dyman and Veritas in the case, some claim theoretically might lie on the appellant's behalf within the framework of the first four counts of the amended complaint. Thus, we do not foreclose the possibility that, on remand, the district court, in its discretion, might yet permit the complaint to be further amended. We do not pursue the point for we must deal with matters as they were when the trial court ruled, not with matters as they might become.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Count Five.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count five is a different kettle of fish. That count embodies a claim for specific performance of the warrant provision of the Agreement executed in connection with the appellant's removal as NetFax's guiding light. The pertinent provision states that Lombardi \"shall grant to Mr. Barrett a warrant to acquire One Million (1,000,000) shares of [NetFax's] common stock . . . at an exercise price of $.001 per share.\" The appellant alleges that Lombardi never delivered the warrant and seeks specific performance of this covenant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over this count because \"the total contract price is $1,000,\" and \"that amount . . . clearly falls short of the $75,000 minimum amount in controversy required\" as a precondition for federal diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a). We review this determination de novo. Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson, 229 F.3d 321, 328 (1st Cir. 2000); Allen v. R &amp; H Oil &amp; Gas Co., 63 F.3d 1326, 1336 (5th Cir. 1995). We conclude that the district court erred by focusing on the exercise price for the shares rather than the value of the warrant itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court erected the framework for determining whether a cause of action satisfies the jurisdictional minimum in St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283 (1938). The Court laid down a general rule to the effect that the amount specified by the plaintiff controls, as long as that amount is asserted in good faith. Id. at 288. Hence, a court can dismiss an action for insufficiency of the amount in controversy only when, \"from the face of the pleadings, it is apparent, to a legal certainty, . . . that the plaintiff never was entitled to recover\" a sum equal to, or in excess of, the jurisdictional minimum. Id. at 289. On this record, we do not believe that the district court supportably could say to a legal certainty that the appellant was not entitled to recover more than $75,000 (or property worth more than that amount) under count five. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, count five involves a warrant to acquire 1,000,000 shares of stock at an exercise price of $.001 per share. The value of a warrant is typically the difference between the market value (during the currency of the warrant period) of the shares to which the warrant pertains and the exercise price payable for those shares. See, e.g., Niagara Hudson Power Corp. v. Leventritt, 340 U.S. 336, 343-44 (1951); Custom Chrome, Inc. v. Comm'r, 217 F.3d 1117, 1125 (9th Cir. 2000); SEC v. Warde, 151 F.3d 42, 46 n.1 (2d Cir. 1998); Swiss Bank Corp. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 141 F.3d 689, 691 (7th Cir. 1998). In his first affidavit, dated October 11, 1999, the appellant estimated the value of NetFax's patented technology at somewhere between $10,000,000 and $100,000,000, and the market value of NetFax stock at somewhere between $0.34 and $2.26 per share. Even taking the low-end valuation, the shares to which the warrant pertained theoretically were worth $340,000 at that point. On this set of assumptions, the value of the warrant (the spread between market value and exercise price) would have been $339,000. This is a sum well above the requisite jurisdictional minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, of course, that the party invoking jurisdiction has the burden to show that it is proper. E.g., Viqueira v. First Bank, 140 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998). In an amount-in-controversy case, however, all the plaintiff must do to carry this burden in the face of a motion to dismiss is to set forth facts which, if true, would prevent the trier from concluding to a legal certainty that the potential recovery is capped at a figure below the jurisdictional minimum. See Dep't of Recreation &amp; Sports v. World Boxing Ass'n, 942 F.2d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 1991). Here, the appellant did supply some information bearing on the value of the warrant, and Lombardi proffered nothing to contradict these figures or otherwise establish that the appellant, even if successful in recovering the property (the warrant), would wind up with a prize worth less than $75,000. We do not think that the district court, on this bareboned record and without conducting an evidentiary hearing, could simply brush aside the appellant's estimates as \"based entirely on speculation\" and declare to a legal certainty that the warrant was worth less than the required jurisdictional amount. For this reason, we hold that the district court erred in dismissing count five of the amended complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons stated, we sustain the determination that Veritas was not properly before the court and, accordingly, we affirm so much of the lower court's order as dismissed, without prejudice, the claims against Veritas. We also affirm the district court's dismissal of the first four counts of the amended complaint as to Lombardi. We hold, however, that the court erred in concluding on this meager record that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the fifth count of the amended complaint. We therefore reverse so much of the order of dismissal as pertains to that count and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To be precise, the appellant filed a motion seeking (1) \"reconsideration of the [district] court's judgment dated February 23, 2000,\" or (2) \"to alter or amend [that] judgment,\" or (3) \"reconsideration under Rule 60(b).\" We do not spend any time on the first two options. After all, new matters cannot be asserted as of right on a motion for reconsideration, Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co., 831 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 1987), and the ten-day window for filing motions to alter or amend, Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), had closed by the time that the appellant filed his motion. Accordingly, we treat the appellant's motion, favorably to him, as one filed under Rule 60(b).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant is a Harvard-trained attorney admitted to the bars of New York, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia. He has practiced securities law for some thirty-five years.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The appellant's dilatoriness is all the more striking because ample opportunity for discovery existed prior to the lower court's ruling. The original complaint was filed by the plaintiff on March 29, 1999; the defendants' joint motion was filed on September 9, 1999; and the district court rendered its decision on February 23, 2000.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Given this holding, we need not evaluate whether the additional facts contained in the second affidavit, if seasonably placed before the court, would have made a dispositive difference on the jurisdictional question. We do note, however, that the contents of that affidavit appear more conclusory than factual.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although the prayer for relief inscribed at the tail end of the amended complaint made a passing reference to money damages regarding one of the four counts, the appellant did not pursue this vague allusion either here or below. Consequently, the averment lacks the capacity to transform the character of the first four counts. See Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1996) (deeming waived an allegation made by the plaintiff in the trial court but not thereafter pressed).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Indeed, the appellant apparently recognizes this shortcoming. See Appellant's Brief at 32 (indicating that \"Veritas has to be before the Court\" in order to effectuate rescission).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> There is a wrinkle here. According to the terms of the Agreement, the warrant expired during the pendency of this appeal. We leave the legal significance (if any) of this new development to the parties and the district court.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Barrett sued his erstwhile co-venturer, Victor J. Lombardi, Jr., and one of Lombardi's companies, Veritas Offshore, Ltd. (Veritas). Acting on the defendants' joint dispositive motion, the district court determined (1) that it lacked in personam jurisdiction over Veritas, and (2) that, for jurisdictional and other reasons, the complaint stated no claim against Lombardi upon which relief could be granted. Barrett appeals from the order of dismissal. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to place these appeals into perspective, we recount the facts as alleged by the appellant in the operative pleading (the first amended complaint), as supplemented by his affidavit in opposition to the joint motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1995, the appellant and Edward Dyman organized NetFax, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for the purpose of developing and commercially exploiting new technologies for Internet facsimile transmission conceived by Frederick Murphy (Dyman's brother-in-law). Murphy himself soon joined the enterprise. The company established a base of operations in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and installed the appellant as its chairman. All the \"founder's stock\" stood in Dyman's name (although the appellant maintains that Dyman held the shares as his nominee).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short order, Lombardi tried to insinuate himself into the business, touting his expertise and connections. Gulled by Lombardi's rodomontade and eager to bring him into the fold, the appellant directed Dyman to transfer a substantial number of NetFax shares to Veritas. These transfers occurred in March 1996 and periodically thereafter, involving an aggregate of 4,046,666 shares (about 30% of the founder's stock). In the same general time frame, Dyman also transferred substantial amounts of stock to the appellant and to Murphy, retaining only a token amount for himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The marriage did not go well. In time, disputes over how to manage the affairs of the fledgling company led to the appellant's ouster as NetFax's chairman. Lombardi took his place. That change in command culminated in the execution of a separation agreement (the Agreement), dated July 31, 1998. In the Agreement, Lombardi promised, among other things, to grant the appellant a warrant, expiring July 31, 2000, for the purchase of 1,000,000 shares of NetFax stock at a price of $0.001 per share. The appellant never received the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombardi's ascension to the throne failed to improve NetFax's fortunes and the company suspended operations in September 1998. Six months later, the appellant went to court. Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), he filed suit against Lombardi and Veritas in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's first amended complaint contains five statements of claim. The first four charge federal securities fraud, deceptive trade practices, common law deceit, and common law misrepresentation, respectively. All of these counts derive from falsehoods attributed to Lombardi, including exaggerations about his supposed expertise and his failure to disclose his checkered financial past (a history that, as the appellant belatedly learned, involved a number of questionable stock deals and a personal bankruptcy). The fifth statement of claim, sounding in contract, concerns Lombardi's refusal to deliver the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants denied the material averments of the complaint and, in due course, filed a motion to dismiss. The district court determined that it lacked in personam jurisdiction over Veritas; that, in all events, the appellant's first four counts were vulnerable because he was not the real party in interest (Dyman, after all, had transferred the shares); and that those counts also failed because of an insufficient showing of damages. These determinations left standing only the breach of contract claim (count five). As to that cause of action, the court focused on the price to be paid for the underlying stock -- 1,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share -- and, by a process of simple multiplication, ascertained that the dispute involved only $1,000. Starting from that premise, the court ruled that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction by reason of an inadequate amount in controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having disposed of all the appellant's claims, the court granted the motion to dismiss and entered judgment in the defendants' favor. The appellant then moved unsuccessfully for relief from the judgment. The district court denied that motion out of hand. These appeals -- one taken upon the initial entry of judgment and the second upon the denial of reconsideration -- followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. CLAIMS AGAINST VERITAS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, efficient resolution of the claims against Veritas does not require us to go beyond the district court's determination that it lacked in personam jurisdiction over that defendant.

Since there is no evidence that it regularly conducts business in Massachusetts, the appellant must establish a basis for the exercise of specific jurisdiction. SeeDonatelli v. Nat'l Hockey League, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534783\"><a href=\"/opinion/534783/john-clark-donatelli-v-national-hockey-league/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span>, 462-63 (1st Cir. 1990) (elucidating concepts of \"general\" and \"specific\" personal jurisdiction, and distinguishing between them). To achieve this goal, the appellant must present sufficient facts to satisfy two cornerstone conditions: \"first, that the forum in which the federal district court sits has a long-arm statute that purports to grant jurisdiction over the defendant; and second, that the exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to that statute comports with the strictures of the Constitution.\" Pritzker v. Yari, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684076\"><a href=\"/opinion/684076/jay-a-pritzker-v-bob-yari/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir. 1994). In this case, then, the appellant cannot hale Veritas into the district court unless he can satisfy the rigors of both the Massachusetts long-arm statute and the United States Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Compliance with the state standard for personal jurisdiction necessitates a showing that the cause of action arises from the defendant's \"transacting any business\" in Massachusetts, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, &#167; 3(a), or from a tortious in-state \"act or omission,\" id. &#167; 3(c). Compliance with the federal constitutional standard involves a somewhat more extensive showing. That showing has three aspects:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the claim underlying the litigation must directly arise out of, or relate to, the defendant's forum-state activities. Second, the defendant's in-state contacts must represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that state's laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before the state's courts foreseeable. Third, the exercise of jurisdiction must, in light of the Gestalt factors, be reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach.

See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Can., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195899\"><a href=\"/opinion/195899/foster-miller-inc-v-babcock/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 145-47 (1st Cir. 1995); Boit v.

The most conventional of these methods -- and the one that applies here -- authorizes the district court to restrict its inquiry to whether the plaintiff has proffered evidence which, if credited, suffices to support a finding of personal jurisdiction. Rodriguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197406\"><a href=\"/opinion/197406/alers-rodriguez-v-national-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 83-84 (1st Cir. 1997); Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make this prima facie showing, the plaintiff cannot rest upon mere averments, but must adduce competent evidence of specific facts. Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145; Boit, 967 F.2d at 675. When he does so, the court must accept the proffer at face value. Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145. Determining the adequacy of this prima facie jurisdictional showing is a quintessentially legal determination -- a determination which, on appeal, engenders de novo review. Rodriguez, 115 F.3d at 84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the circumstances at bar, the district court correctly found the appellant's proffer wanting. The appellant failed even to allege -- let alone offer competent proof -- that Veritas had conducted any business in Massachusetts or that it had any significant ties to the state. Indeed, the appellant's only mention of Veritas in either his amended complaint or in his affidavit in opposition to the motion to dismiss indicated that Veritas was the transferee and holder of the NetFax shares, and that he believed it to be owned and managed by Lombardi. The mere acceptance of shares transferred from within the forum state, without more, does not constitute a minimum contact sufficient to subject a foreign corporation to jurisdiction in that state's courts. E.g., Shaffer v. Heitner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109721\"><a href=\"/opinion/109721/shaffer-v-heitner/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 216 (1977). Nor will the fact that the transferee is beneficially owned or controlled by a person or entity who does business in the forum state suffice to tip the jurisdictional balance. See Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111116\"><a href=\"/opinion/111116/keeton-v-hustler-magazine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span>, 781 n.13 (1984) (\"[N]or does jurisdiction over a parent corporation automatically establish jurisdiction over a wholly owned subsidiary.\"); Cent.

This attempt fizzles. In order to defeat a motion to dismiss for want of inpersonam jurisdiction, a plaintiff must do more than simply surmise the existence of a favorable factual scenario; he must verify the facts alleged through materials of evidentiary quality. See Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145; Boit, 967 F.2d at 675. Thus, allegations in a lawyer's brief or legal memorandum are insufficient, even under the relatively relaxed prima facie standard, to establish jurisdictional facts. Cf. Fragoso v. Lopez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605524\"><a href=\"/opinion/605524/carmen-fragoso-aka-carmen-fragoso-de-conway-v-dr-maria-a-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">878</span></a></span>, 887 (1st Cir. 1993) (explaining that statements in a brief are not adequate to forestall summary judgment); Kelly v.

He is wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion for relief from judgment cannot be used merely to reargue a point already decided. See Cody, Inc. v. Town of Woodbury, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764674\"><a href=\"/opinion/764674/cody-inc-on-its-own-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-its-directors-and-members/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 56 (2d Cir. 1999); Cashner v.

Given the lack of exceptional circumstances justifying extraordinary relief under subsection (6) of Rule 60(b), Ahmed v.

That subsection permits a court to relieve a party from a final judgment on the ground of \"mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1). The second affidavit, however, includes nothing that indicates why the information that it contains was omitted from the appellant's first affidavit. This brings the appellant's case within the ambit of our holding in Mas Marques v. Digital Equipment Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"385711\"><a href=\"/opinion/385711/24-fair-emplpraccas-1286-24-empl-prac-dec-p-31415-diego-mas-marques/\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Mas Marques, as here, the plaintiff filed a motion and affidavit after the entry of judgment. Id. at 28. There, as here, the late affidavit contained no explanation for the plaintiff's failure to submit the critical information to the court at an earlier date. Id. at 29. There, as here, the plaintiff made no assertion that further facts became known to him only after judgment had been entered. Id. Given those omissions, the district court concluded that the tardy affidavit did not warrant relief under Rule 60(b). We agreed, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances, particularly where [the plaintiff] should have been aware of the deficiencies in his case before the entry of judgment, relief under Rule 60(b) would not have been justified. . . .

Because the appellant has given no acceptable reason for the delay in presenting the second affidavit to the district court, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in refusing to reopen the jurisdictional question. See 12 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 60.41[1][c][ii] (3d ed. 1999) (\"Courts repeatedly deny relief when they find that the facts and circumstances demonstrate a lack of diligence in pursuing . . . litigation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant strives to avoid this result in two ways. First, he asks for leniency on the basis that he originally filed suit pro se. This request seems disingenuous. While pro se litigants sometimes are accorded a measure of latitude in procedural matters, e.g., Instituto de Educacion Universal Corp. v. United States Dep't of Educ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198880\"><a href=\"/opinion/198880/instituto-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 2000), no such latitude is warranted where, as here, the unrepresented party is himself a lawyer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Godlove v. Bamberger, Foreman, Oswald &amp; Hahn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541989\"><a href=\"/opinion/541989/joan-godlove-v-bamberger-foreman-oswald-and-hahn-a-general-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1145</span></a></span>, 1148 (7th Cir. 1990). And at any rate, by the time the motion to dismiss was argued, the appellant had retained counsel who appeared on his behalf. Under the circumstances, the appellant is not entitled to any special solicitude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's second initiative consists of a plea, made in his Rule 60(b) motion, that the district court ought not to have dismissed the complaint without affording him the opportunity to conduct discovery about Veritas and its business activities. This plea lacks merit. If a party needs jurisdictional discovery, that party has an obligation to request it in a timely manner. Rodriguez, 115 F.3d at 86; Whittaker Corp. v. United Aircraft Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"312802\"><a href=\"/opinion/312802/whittaker-corporation-v-united-aircraft-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span>, 1086 (1st Cir. 1973). The appellant failed to fulfill this obligation: to the contrary, he did not seek additional discovery at any time prior to the entry of an adverse judgment. This was plainly too late.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See Rodriguez, 115 F.3d at 86. Consequently, we cannot fault the district court for denying the motion for relief from judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE CLAIMS AGAINST LOMBARDI</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Veritas, see supra Part II, impacts the appellant's other claims as well. That holding leaves Lombardi as the sole defendant. Personal jurisdiction over him is not a problem. The district court found, preliminarily, that it had such jurisdiction, and Lombardi does not now contest that finding. We return, then, to the claims limned in the amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The First Four Counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first four counts of the amended complaint, the appellant has thus far sought rescission -- and only rescission -- as a remedy. The district court highlighted this narrow focus, observing that these counts \"contain[] no explicit statement of harm or loss.\" The appellant's brief on appeal likewise emphasizes this focus, and his counsel twice reaffirmed at oral argument in this court that rescission was the goal of the first four counts. Finally, the appellant presented no developed argumentation in support of a claim for money damages in either the district court or this court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, no claim for money damages is properly in the case at this juncture. SeeGooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508719\"><a href=\"/opinion/508719/william-r-gooley-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 515 (1st Cir. 1988) (discussing pleader's obligation to allege \"each material element necessary to sustain recovery\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are the first four counts viable in respect to the prayer for rescission. When a party seeks to rescind a contract for the transfer of property, a court ordinarily can enforce rescission only as between the party who surrendered the property (or persons claiming by, through, or under that party) and the party who holds the property. Here, Dyman (who delivered the disputed stock) is not a party, and Veritas (which now holds the stock) is not properly before the court. To cinch matters, none of the counts in question either state facts sufficient to place the appellant in Dyman's shoes or delineate any theory under which rescission might be ordered in the absence of both the transferor and the transferee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Consequently, the district court's decision to dismiss the first four counts of the amended complaint in their entirety passes muster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before leaving this topic, we hasten to add an acknowledgment that, even without Dyman and Veritas in the case, some claim theoretically might lie on the appellant's behalf within the framework of the first four counts of the amended complaint. Thus, we do not foreclose the possibility that, on remand, the district court, in its discretion, might yet permit the complaint to be further amended. We do not pursue the point for we must deal with matters as they were when the trial court ruled, not with matters as they might become.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Count Five.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count five is a different kettle of fish. That count embodies a claim for specific performance of the warrant provision of the Agreement executed in connection with the appellant's removal as NetFax's guiding light. The pertinent provision states that Lombardi \"shall grant to Mr. Barrett a warrant to acquire One Million (1,000,000) shares of [NetFax's] common stock . . . at an exercise price of $.001 per share.\" The appellant alleges that Lombardi never delivered the warrant and seeks specific performance of this covenant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over this count because \"the total contract price is $1,000,\" and \"that amount . . . clearly falls short of the $75,000 minimum amount in controversy required\" as a precondition for federal diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a). We review this determination de novo. Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v.

The Court laid down a general rule to the effect that the amount specified by the plaintiff controls, as long as that amount is asserted in good faith. Id. at 288. Hence, a court can dismiss an action for insufficiency of the amount in controversy only when, \"from the face of the pleadings, it is apparent, to a legal certainty, . . . that the plaintiff never was entitled to recover\" a sum equal to, or in excess of, the jurisdictional minimum. Id. at 289. On this record, we do not believe that the district court supportably could say to a legal certainty that the appellant was not entitled to recover more than $75,000 (or property worth more than that amount) under count five. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, count five involves a warrant to acquire 1,000,000 shares of stock at an exercise price of $.001 per share. The value of a warrant is typically the difference between the market value (during the currency of the warrant period) of the shares to which the warrant pertains and the exercise price payable for those shares. See, e.g., Niagara Hudson Power Corp. v. Leventritt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104846\"><a href=\"/opinion/104846/niagara-hudson-power-corp-v-leventritt/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 343-44 (1951); Custom Chrome, Inc. v. Comm'r, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769343\"><a href=\"/opinion/769343/custom-chrome-inc-and-subsidiaries-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span>, 1125 (9th Cir. 2000); SEC v. Warde, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756657\"><a href=\"/opinion/756657/fed-sec-l-rep-p-90239-securities-and-exchange-commission-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 46 n.1 (2d Cir. 1998); Swiss Bank Corp. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753021\"><a href=\"/opinion/753021/swiss-bank-corporation-and-oconnor-investments-v-dresser-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span>, 691 (7th Cir. 1998). In his first affidavit, dated October 11, 1999, the appellant estimated the value of NetFax's patented technology at somewhere between $10,000,000 and $100,000,000, and the market value of NetFax stock at somewhere between $0.34 and $2.26 per share. Even taking the low-end valuation, the shares to which the warrant pertained theoretically were worth $340,000 at that point. On this set of assumptions, the value of the warrant (the spread between market value and exercise price) would have been $339,000. This is a sum well above the requisite jurisdictional minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, of course, that the party invoking jurisdiction has the burden to show that it is proper. E.g., Viqueira v. First Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197886\"><a href=\"/opinion/197886/jamie-viqueira-v-first-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1998). In an amount-in-controversy case, however, all the plaintiff must do to carry this burden in the face of a motion to dismiss is to set forth facts which, if true, would prevent the trier from concluding to a legal certainty that the potential recovery is capped at a figure below the jurisdictional minimum. See Dep't of Recreation &amp; Sports v. World Boxing Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566803\"><a href=\"/opinion/566803/department-of-recreation-and-sports-of-puerto-rico-v-world-boxing/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 88 (1st Cir. 1991). Here, the appellant did supply some information bearing on the value of the warrant, and Lombardi proffered nothing to contradict these figures or otherwise establish that the appellant, even if successful in recovering the property (the warrant), would wind up with a prize worth less than $75,000. We do not think that the district court, on this bareboned record and without conducting an evidentiary hearing, could simply brush aside the appellant's estimates as \"based entirely on speculation\" and declare to a legal certainty that the warrant was worth less than the required jurisdictional amount. For this reason, we hold that the district court erred in dismissing count five of the amended complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons stated, we sustain the determination that Veritas was not properly before the court and, accordingly, we affirm so much of the lower court's order as dismissed, without prejudice, the claims against Veritas. We also affirm the district court's dismissal of the first four counts of the amended complaint as to Lombardi. We hold, however, that the court erred in concluding on this meager record that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the fifth count of the amended complaint. We therefore reverse so much of the order of dismissal as pertains to that count and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To be precise, the appellant filed a motion seeking (1) \"reconsideration of the [district] court's judgment dated February 23, 2000,\" or (2) \"to alter or amend [that] judgment,\" or (3) \"reconsideration under Rule 60(b).\" We do not spend any time on the first two options. After all, new matters cannot be asserted as of right on a motion for reconsideration, Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495473\"><a href=\"/opinion/495473/application-for-issuance-of-order-requiring-the-united-states-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir. 1987), and the ten-day window for filing motions to alter or amend, Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), had closed by the time that the appellant filed his motion. Accordingly, we treat the appellant's motion, favorably to him, as one filed under Rule 60(b).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant is a Harvard-trained attorney admitted to the bars of New York, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia. He has practiced securities law for some thirty-five years.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The appellant's dilatoriness is all the more striking because ample opportunity for discovery existed prior to the lower court's ruling. The original complaint was filed by the plaintiff on March 29, 1999; the defendants' joint motion was filed on September 9, 1999; and the district court rendered its decision on February 23, 2000.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Given this holding, we need not evaluate whether the additional facts contained in the second affidavit, if seasonably placed before the court, would have made a dispositive difference on the jurisdictional question. We do note, however, that the contents of that affidavit appear more conclusory than factual.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although the prayer for relief inscribed at the tail end of the amended complaint made a passing reference to money damages regarding one of the four counts, the appellant did not pursue this vague allusion either here or below. Consequently, the averment lacks the capacity to transform the character of the first four counts. See Aulson v. Blanchard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717572\"><a href=\"/opinion/717572/alan-aulson-et-ux-maureen-aulson-v-charles-blanchard/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir. 1996) (deeming waived an allegation made by the plaintiff in the trial court but not thereafter pressed).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Indeed, the appellant apparently recognizes this shortcoming. See Appellant's Brief at 32 (indicating that \"Veritas has to be before the Court\" in order to effectuate rescission).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> There is a wrinkle here. According to the terms of the Agreement, the warrant expired during the pendency of this appeal. We leave the legal significance (if any) of this new development to the parties and the district court.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
