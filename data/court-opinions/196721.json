Quiles-Espinosa,\r                                                                             \r\nSenior  Litigation Counsel,  and Miguel  A.

In United  States v. Rosales,  19 F.3d 763\r                                                           \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1994), this  court affirmed defendant's conviction\r\n\non  four counts of abusive sexual conduct, in violation of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   2244(a)(1), but remanded for resentencing because of\r\n\nthe district court's  failure to provide a  rationale for the\r\n\ndegree of upward departure undertaken.  On remand,  the lower\r\n\ncourt again departed  upward under U.S.S.G.   5K2.0 and again\r\n\nimposed a 120-month prison term.  Defendant  now advances two\r\n\nprincipal challenges to his new sentence--insisting  that (1)\r\n\nthe imposition of a  two-level enhancement under    3C1.1 for\r\n\nobstruction  of justice was unwarranted, and (2) the level of\r\n\nupward  departure was  unreasonable.   As  neither contention\r\n\nproves persuasive, we summarily affirm. \r\n\n     Extended  discussion  is  unnecessary.     The     3C1.1\r\n\nenhancement was grounded  on the district court's  conclusion\r\n\nthat  defendant committed perjury  during his trial testimony\r\n\nby repeatedly denying any involvement in the specific offense\r\n\nconduct charged.  See,  e.g., United States v. Dunnigan,  507\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 87, 98  (1993) (\"Upon  a proper  determination that  the\r\n\naccused  has committed  perjury at  trial, an  enhancement of\r\n\nsentence is required by the  Sentencing Guidelines.\").  In so\r\n\nconcluding,  the court  applied  the correct  legal test  for\r\n\nperjury:  \"whether  the  defendant  intentionally  gave false\r\n\ntestimony concerning  a material  matter.\"  United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCampbell, 61 F.3d  976, 984  (1st Cir. 1995).   Its  findings\r                    \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nadequately   encompassed   all  of   the   necessary  factual\r\n\npredicates.  See, e.g.,  United States v. Matiz, 14  F.3d 79,\r                                                           \r\n\n84  (1st Cir.  1994)  (rejecting challenge  to findings  less\r\n\ncomprehensive than  those issued  here).  And  those findings\r\n\nwere  adequately supported  by the  record.   Indeed, as  the\r\n\ndistrict court observed, the  nature of defendant's denials--\r\n\npertaining  to specific  allegations  of  personal  conduct--\r\n\nbelied  any  suggestion  that  his inaccurate  testimony  was\r\n\nattributable  to  \"confusion,  mistake,  or  faulty  memory.\"\r\n\nDunnigan, 507 U.S. at 95.\r                    \r\n\n     In objecting to the upward departure, defendant does not\r\n\ncontend that either of  the aggravating circumstances  relied\r\n\non by  the district court was an improper basis upon which to\r\n\nground a departure.1   He does not assert that  either factor\r                               1\r\n\nwas factually  unsupported.  And  he does  not reiterate  his\r\n\nearlier  argument   that   the  degree   of   departure   was\r\n\nunexplained.  Instead, he insists  simply that the extent  of\r\n\nthe departure undertaken was unreasonable.  We disagree.  \r\n\n     The district  court departed upward by  eight levels and\r\n\nimposed  a term of 120 months--a sentence representing a 110%\r\n\nincrease over  the applicable sentencing range  ceiling of 57\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1  The court rested  its decision to depart upward  on two\r               1\r\nfactors:  the  fact   that  four   additional  victims   were\r\nidentified beyond those involved in the counts of conviction,\r\nand  the fact that most of defendant's victims were abused on\r\nmultiple occasions.    It  ended  up adding  four  levels  to\r\naccount  for each of these concerns, for a total departure of\r\neight levels.  \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nmonths.    Such a  departure,  while  substantial, cannot  be\r\n\ndeemed anomalous;  we have upheld departures  of even greater\r\n\nmagnitude on various occasions.   See, e.g., United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 411 (1st Cir. 1995) (reviewing cases in\r                   \r\n\nwhich upward departures representing  increases of from  165%\r\n\nto  380%  over  the   respective  GSR  ceilings  were  deemed\r\n\nreasonable).  And  the 120-month sentence  was well short  of\r\n\nthe  applicable  40-year  statutory  maximum.    Given  these\r\n\nconsiderations, given the  \"persuasive[ness]\" of the district\r\n\ncourt's explanation  for selecting the  degree of  departure,\r\n\nUnited  States v. Quinones, 26 F.3d 213, 220 (1st Cir. 1994),\r                                      \r\n\nand given  the \"substantial leeway\"  that is accorded  such a\r\n\ndetermination, United States v. Pratt, 73 F.3d 450, 453  (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1996), we  are unprepared  to say that  the court  acted\r\n\nunreasonably.2\r                         2\r\n\n     Affirmed.

And the 120-month sentence was well short of the applicable 40-year statutory maximum.   Given these considerations, given the \"persuasive[ness]\" of the district court's explanation for selecting the degree of departure, United States v. Quinones, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672030\"><a href=\"/opinion/672030/united-states-v-jesus-m-quinones-aka-jesus-m-quinones-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 220 (1st Cir.1994), and given the \"substantial leeway\" that is accorded such a determination, United States v. Pratt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196520\"><a href=\"/opinion/196520/united-states-v-pratt/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, 453 (1st Cir.1996), we are unprepared to say that the court acted unreasonably.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. See Loc.

It ended up adding four levels to account for each of these concerns, for a total departure of eight levels</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Defendant has listed some five other issues in his \"statement of issues,\" but has provided no argument with respect thereto.   We therefore decline to address them.  See, e.g., McIntosh v.
