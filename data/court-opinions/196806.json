Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Cyr and Boudin,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n   Francisco A. Perez Reynoso on brief pro se.\r                                         \r\n   Kevin G. Little on Anders brief for appellant.\r                                        \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Francisco Perez Reynoso pled guilty to\r                                \r\n\npossession of cocaine with  intent to distribute in violation\r\n\nof 46 U.S.C.  App.   1903(a)(b)(1) and (f) and  18 U.S.C.   2\r\n\nand   was sentenced to 108  months in prison.   He then filed\r\n\nthis appeal.  Appellate  counsel has now filed a  brief under\r\n\nAnders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), asserting the lack\r                                \r\n\nof any  meritorious  ground  for appeal,  and  has  moved  to\r\n\nwithdraw  as counsel.   Perez has filed  a separate appellate\r\n\nbrief  and other  materials challenging  his guilty  plea and\r\n\nsentence.  Because the appeal presents no meritorious issues,\r\n\nwe affirm Perez's conviction and sentence and grant counsel's\r\n\nmotion to withdraw.           I.  Challenge to Guilty Plea\r                                                                      \r\n\n          Perez contends, in substance,  that his guilty plea\r\n\nwas not voluntarily and knowingly entered.  He claims that he\r\n\nnever agreed  to plead guilty  in exchange  for a  government\r\n\nrecommendation  that he  receive  a ten-year,  rather than  a\r\n\nseven-year, sentence.  He says in his appellate brief that he\r\n\ndid not know that his recommended sentence would be ten years\r\n\nuntil  he was in the  plea hearing; in  a different appellate\r\n\nsubmission,  he states that  he did not know  he faced a ten-\r\n\nyear sentence until he signed his plea agreement.  Perez also\r\n\nclaims that the government promised to recommend a seven-year\r\n\nsentence if he cooperated and that his first counsel had been\r\n\nnegotiating a  seven-year plea agreement when  threats by his\r\n\nco-defendants made him obtain her dismissal.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          We assess  those claims  in light of  the following\r\n\nfactors:  their plausibility, the timing of Perez's challenge\r\n\nto his  guilty plea;  whether he  asserts his  innocence; and\r\n\nwhether his plea  was involuntary, in  derogation of Rule  11\r\n\nrequirements,  or otherwise  legally  suspect.    See  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.  Lopez-Pineda, 55 F.2d  693, 696 (1st  Cir.), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 116 S. Ct. 259 (1995).  All of those factors indicate\r                  \r\n\nthat Perez's guilty plea should be sustained.  \r\n\n          The record does not support Perez's contention that\r\n\nhis  plea  was not  voluntarily  or knowingly  entered.   The\r\n\nrecord shows that Perez knew the government would recommend a\r\n\nten-year sentence before he pled  guilty.  The plea agreement\r\n\nhe signed  before pleading guilty explicitly  stated that the\r                             \r\n\ngovernment would  recommend a  120-month sentence  (i.e., ten\r\n\nyears).   His attorney's alleged failure to tell him that the\r\n\nrecommended  sentence would  be ten  rather than  seven years\r\n\nuntil right  before  he signed  the plea  agreement does  not\r\n\nwarrant invalidating  his subsequent  guilty plea.   Since he\r\n\nknew by the  time of  the plea hearing  that his  recommended\r\n\nsentence was ten  years, he  did not reasonably  rely on  any\r\n\nearlier representation regarding a  seven-year recommendation\r\n\nin  pleading guilty.  Finally, as the plea agreement and plea\r\n\nhearing  transcript make  clear,  Perez knew  before he  pled\r\n\nguilty  that the only terms and  conditions applicable to his\r\n\nguilty  plea  were  those   contained  in  his  written  plea\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nagreement.   Thus,  he knew  that any  verbal representations\r\n\nconcerning  a seven-year sentence,  allegedly made in earlier\r\n\ndiscussions between the government and his first counsel, did\r\n\nnot apply.  \r\n\n          Consideration  of  the  other  factors  cited above\r\n\nshows  as well that Perez's guilty  plea should be sustained.\r\n\nAs noted, Perez never  asked the district court to  allow him\r\n\nto withdraw his guilty plea; hence, his  present challenge is\r\n\nvery belated.   Moreover, he  does not assert  his innocence,\r\n\nbut only that he did not want to plead guilty  if he received\r\n\na ten-year sentence.  He has not alleged that his guilty plea\r\n\nwas  coerced; indeed, in his  plea agreement and  at his plea\r\n\nhearing,  he stated  that it  was not  coerced.   He  has not\r\n\nalleged  that he did not  understand the charges  to which he\r\n\npled  guilty.   Lastly,  the plea  hearing  was conducted  in\r\n\nconformity with the requirements of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11.\r\n\n          II.  Challenge to Sentencing\r                                                  \r\n\n          On appeal,  Perez suggests  that  his base  offense\r\n\nlevel should have been less than 31 for two reasons.  He says\r\n\nthat he was a minimal,  not just a minor, participant in  the\r\n\noffense  to which  he  pled guilty.    See U.  S.  Sentencing\r                                                      \r\n\nGuideline    3B1.2(a) &amp; (b).   He also claims that mitigating\r\n\ncircumstances  warranted a lower base offense level.  \r\n\n          In part, Perez is  asking us to relieve him  of the\r\n\nconcessions  he made in his  plea agreement --  that his base\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\noffense level would be 31, that he was a  minor (not minimal)\r\n\nparticipant,  and that  no  further adjustments  to his  base\r\n\noffense level would be made -- which we perceive no basis for\r\n\ndoing.  We also note that the sentencing transcript indicates\r\n\nthat Perez  had ample opportunity to  describe his mitigating\r\n\ncircumstances at sentencing and that the court was influenced\r\n\nby his  allocution.   The court  imposed the lowest  sentence\r\n\npossible  given  Perez's  sentencing  guideline  range  --  a\r\n\nsentence  which was  twelve months  lower than the  one Perez\r\n\nagreed to in his plea agreement.  Perez did not ask the court\r\n\nto depart downward from the sentencing guideline range.\r\n\n          We affirm  appellant's conviction and  sentence and\r                                                                         \r\n\ngrant appellate counsel's motion to withdraw.\r                                                         \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",
