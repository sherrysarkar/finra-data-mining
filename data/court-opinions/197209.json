This  is  a  straightforward\r                                        \r\n\nemployment discrimination  case  brought by  appellant  Alvin\r\n\nTerry under  both the federal  and state  anti-discrimination\r\n\nstatutes.  42 U.S.C.   2000e-2(a)(1); Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B,\r\n\n  4(1).   Terry claims that  he was not hired  as a permanent\r\n\ncomputer operator  at Electronic Data Systems  because of his\r\n\nrace.    Terry was  a temporary  employee  who was  offered a\r\n\npermanent  position subject  to a  background check;  but the\r\n\noffer was withdrawn after that check. \r\n\n     The  district court  granted  the employer's  motion for\r\n\nsummary judgment,  finding that  Terry had made  out a  prima\r                                                                         \r\n\nfacie  case but  that the  presumption of  discrimination had\r                 \r\n\nbeen negated  because the employer provided  an adequate non-\r\n\ndiscriminatory reason for not  hiring Terry--namely, that the\r\n\nbackground  check revealed  that Terry  had a  credit problem\r\n\nrelating to  an  unpaid  student loan  and  Terry  showed  no\r\n\nconcern when asked about the matter.  Since Terry did not put\r\n\nforward any substantial evidence of discrimination beyond the\r\n\nprima facie case and produced no evidence that the employer's\r                       \r\n\nstated reason was pretextual, this disposed of the case under\r\n\nboth the federal and state doctrines.\r\n\n     We need not consider  whether or not a prima  facie case\r                                                                    \r\n\nwas  made out by Terry, since  it is crystal clear that apart\r\n\nfrom  a   prima  facie  case,  no   substantial  evidence  of\r                                  \r\n\ndiscrimination was  presented, nor  any  basis for  believing\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nthat the non-discriminatory explanation of the employer was a\r\n\npretext.   Terry's efforts on appeal to manufacture a factual\r\n\nconflict  out   of  some  pleading   discrepancies  and   his\r\n\nspeculative  appraisals of the employer's attitude toward him\r\n\nare too thin to warrant any extended discussion.\r\n\n     Affirmed. \r                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n",
