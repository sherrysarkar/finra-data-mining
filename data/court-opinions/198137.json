KOGUT,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n                DR. BERNARD KATZ, ET AL.,\r\n\n                  Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n       [Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n            Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Ronald J. Kogut on brief pro se.\r\n Bruce R. Henry and Morrison, Mahoney &amp; Miller on brief for\r\nappellees Katz and Neitlich.\r\n Nancy Ankers White, Special Assistant Attorney General, and\r\nMichael H. Cohen, Supervising Counsel, on brief for appellees\r\nCentola, Nelson and Brady.\r\n\nSeptember 22, 1998\r\n\n       Per Curiam.  Plaintiff Ronald Kogut, a Massachusetts\r\ninmate, claims that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated\r\nwhen, upon his transfer from the Bridgewater State Hospital\r\n(BSH) to a county jail in Northampton, he was unable to obtain\r\ncopies of his BSH medical records.  He alleges that treatment\r\nof his various psychological ailments was thereby disrupted--\r\nresulting in a suicide attempt, severe depression, sleep\r\ndeprivation, and other impairments.  The instant pro se action,\r\nbrought under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against five BSH officials,\r\nfollowed.  In due course, the district court dismissed the\r\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim.  We affirm.\r\n    Little discussion is required.  With respect to three of\r\nthe defendants (Brady, Katz and Neitlich), there has been no\r\nallegation of any personal involvement on their part, whether\r\ndirect or otherwise, in the matters at issue here.  This alone\r\nprovided a sufficient basis for dismissal of the claims against\r\nthem.  See, e.g., Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23\r\nF.3d 576, 581-82 (1st Cir. 1994). \r\n    With respect to the remaining two defendants (Nelson, the\r\nBSH superintendent, and Centola, the BSH records keeper), no\r\nshowing of \"deliberate indifference\" has been made.  This\r\nstandard requires a state of mind akin to criminal\r\nrecklessness--i.e., that the official knew of and consciously\r\ndisregarded a substantial risk of serious harm.  See, e.g.,\r\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994); Mahan v. Plymouth\r\nCounty House of Corrections, 64 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\nEven with all reasonable inferences drawn in plaintiff's favor,\r\nthe allegations in his complaint and supporting papers fall\r\nwell short of such a showing--for at least three reasons.  \r\n    First, there has been no suggestion that either Nelson or\r\nCentola was aware of plaintiff's psychological condition, much\r\nless that it might have required close monitoring.  In his\r\nseveral written requests for his BSH records, for example,\r\nplaintiff never described his ailments or conveyed any sense of\r\nurgency.  Second, even if defendants had learned of his\r\ncondition, there is no indication that they would have thereby\r\nbeen alerted to the need for prompt medical treatment. \r\nAlthough plaintiff was eventually treated with lithium at the\r\njail with positive results, he indicates that, while at BSH, he\r\nwas simply given \"strong medication to sleep at night\"--a\r\ncourse of treatment that defendants could reasonably assume was\r\navailable at the jail.  Compare, e.g., Hudson v. McHugh, 148\r\nF.3d 859, 863-64 (7th Cir. 1998) (finding that claim had been\r\nstated against officials at receiving correctional facility,\r\nbut not against those at transferring facility, where required\r\ndaily dose of anti-convulsive medicine had been withheld from\r\ninmate for eleven days following transfer despite his repeated\r\nrequests, resulting in epileptic seizure).  Finally, from all\r\nthat appears, the actions of both Nelson and Centola were\r\nunobjectionable here with regard to plaintiffs requests for his\r\nrecords.  Nelson simply referred those requests to Centola. \r\nAnd Centola properly advised plaintiff that a \"witnessed\"\r\nrequest form and a waiver of copying costs (or prepayment\r\nthereof if not indigent) were required.\r\n    We need not address whether defendants' alleged failure to\r\nforward the medical records to the jail officials (as opposed\r\nto plaintiff personally) comported with state law.  See, e.g.,\r\n105 C.M.R.  205.503 (requiring that copy of medical record or\r\nsummary sheet \"accompany the inmate\" upon transfer to another\r\ncorrectional or health care facility).  Plaintiff has not\r\nargued the point.  And even if one or more of the defendants\r\nmight have been negligent in this regard (a matter we do not\r\ndecide), no deliberate indifference is apparent under the\r\ncircumstances here presented. \r\n    Affirmed.\r\n",
