Plaintiff argues on\n\nappeal that the district court is biased toward him because\n\nhe is a pro se litigant.\n\n         We have acknowledged that:\n\n         Our judicial system zealously guards the\n         attempts of pro se litigants on their\n         own behalf. We are required to construe\n         liberally a pro se complaint and may\n         affirm its dismissal only if a plaintiff\n         cannot prove any set of facts entitling\n         him or her to relief.\n\nAhmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 889 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nHonoring this policy, the district court initially      denied\n\nthe motion to dismiss despite the plaintiff's failure to\n\nsubstantiate   the   amount   in   controversy   required   for\n\ndiversity jurisdiction.    The court recognized, sua sponte,\n\nthat the plaintiff might be able to prove facts entitling\n\nhim to relief under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and\n\nallowed the plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint\n\fto add a federal claim as well as any pendent state claims.\n\nThe    plaintiff     chose    to    reject    the   court's    suggestion,\n\ninstead filing an amendment which asserted more state claims\n\n(none of which supported the jurisdictional minimum).                    The\n\ndistrict court then reluctantly dismissed the action.\n\n               In this court, the plaintiff continues to insist\n\nthat his amended pleading is sufficient.                  It is not.\n\n               We respect the right of every litigant in our\n\nadversarial system, including pro se litigants, to be the\n\nmaster of their own cause.              Still, we ordinarily cannot\n\nrelieve a party from his own intransigence or \"insulate\" him\n\nfrom     the     rudimentary        requirements     of     substantiating\n\njurisdiction.        Ahmed, 118 F.2d at 889.         Reviewing the issue\n\nde     novo,    we   find    that    the     plaintiff's     amendment   is\n\ninsufficient to substantiate the jurisdictional minimum.\n\nFaced with the plaintiff’s insistence on an apparently self-\n\ndefeating course of action, the district court correctly\n\ndismissed this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n               Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f",
