This  appeal  raises  the\r                                              \r\n\nquestion  whether an insurance carrier  has a duty  to defend and\r\n\nindemnify  its  insured  against  lawsuits currently  pending  in\r\n\nMassachusetts  courts under  two Comprehensive  General Liability\r\n\ninsurance policies.  The  district court granted summary judgment\r\n\nin favor of the carrier, and the insured appeals.  Concluding, on\r\n\nthe  present state of the  record, that the  carrier must fulfill\r\n\nthe first of these duties, i.e., the duty to defend the lawsuits,\r\n\nwe reverse and remand.\r\n\n                          I. Background\r                                                 \r\n\n     Appellee GRE Insurance Group (GRE)  sold the two policies at\r\n\nissue here to appellant Metropolitan Boston Housing  Partnership,\r\n\nInc.   (Metropolitan),  and  one  of  its  predecessor  entities,\r\n\nMetropolitan Housing, Inc. (MHI).   Metropolitan, like MHI before\r\n\nit,   disburses   federal   and  state   housing   subsidies   to\r\n\nparticipating   landlords  and  tenants.1    Metropolitan  issues\r\n\nCertificates  of  Participation  to  eligible tenants,  who  then\r\n\nsearch  the private rental housing market.  Once a tenant locates\r\n\na suitable unit,  Metropolitan steps in  and negotiates the  rent\r\n\nwith the property's landlord.  Metropolitan and the landlord then\r\n\nenter into an agreement regarding the payment of  rent subsidies,\r\n\nand the tenant  and landlord  sign a lease.   Metropolitan  never\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1  MHI  and  Metropolitan   were  formed  to  privatize  the\r\nfunctions  previously  performed   by  the  Metropolitan  Housing\r\nAssistance  Program  of  the  Massachusetts  Executive  Office of\r\nCommunities and Development.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nbecomes  a  party  to  the  lease,  nor  acquires  any possessory\r\n\ninterest in the apartments.\r\n\n     Before  agreeing   to  subsidize  a   particular  apartment,\r\n\nMetropolitan inspects the premises to insure that federal Housing\r\n\nQuality Standards  are satisfied.   A Metropolitan representative\r\n\nvisits the  apartment and,  after visual inspection,  completes a\r\n\nchecklist  confirming  the number  and  types  of rooms,  whether\r\n\nsinks, stoves,  and refrigerators  are in working  order, and  so\r\n\nforth.  Metropolitan's inspectors never  test for the presence of\r\n\nlead  paint.   Instead,  they simply  note  whether the  paint is\r\n\nchipped  or peeling,  and whether  the landlord  has a  Letter of\r\n\nCompliance from a licensed lead paint inspector attesting to lead\r\n\npaint safety.  If no letter is on file, the landlord is told that\r\n\none is required before the subsidy will be given.\r\n\n     Despite  this rather  limited  role,  Metropolitan has  been\r\n\nnamed  as  a   defendant  or  third   party  defendant  in   five\r\n\nMassachusetts state lawsuits alleging personal injury due to lead\r\n\npaint exposure  of minors at  Metropolitan-subsidized apartments.\r\n\nThese suits  assert a number of different  legal theories against\r\n\nMetropolitan, many of which  are based on its alleged  failure to\r\n\ninspect adequately  for lead  paint before agreeing  to subsidize\r\n\nthe apartments.\r\n\n     GRE  filed  this  diversity  action  seeking  a  declaratory\r\n\njudgment  that it  had  no  obligation  to  defend  or  indemnify\r\n\nMetropolitan against the lawsuits, and the district court granted\r\n\nsummary judgment in its favor.  Metropolitan now appeals.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n                           II. Analysis\r                                                 \r\n\n     We  review de  novo the  district court's  interpretation of\r                                  \r\n\nthese insurance contracts, St.  Paul Fire and Marine Ins.

Commercial\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnion  Ins.

Absent\r             \r\n\nambiguity,  we  give  policy  language  its  plain  and  ordinary\r\n\nmeaning.   E.g., Cody v.  Connecticut General Life  Ins. Co., 387\r                                                                      \r\n\nMass.  142, 146,  439 N.E.2d  234, 237  (1982).   Ambiguities are\r\n\nresolved against  the insurer,  who drafted  the  policy, and  in\r\n\nfavor  of  the  insured.    Thus,  if  \"there  are  two  rational\r\n\ninterpretations of  policy language,  the insured is  entitled to\r\n\nthe benefit of the one that is more favorable to it.\"  Hazen, 407\r                                                                      \r\n\nMass.  at 700, 555 N.E.2d at 583.   The insured bears the initial\r\n\nburden  of proving  that  a  claim  falls  within  the  grant  of\r\n\ncoverage,  which, once  established, shifts  the burden  onto the\r\n\ninsurer to show the applicability of any exclusion.

Co. v. Gilbane  Bldg. Co., 391\r                                                                      \r\n\nMass. 143, 146,  461 N.E.2d 209, 212  (1984)) (internal quotation\r\n\nomitted).   At issue here are two  combined comprehensive general\r\n\nliability  and commercial  property insurance  policies.   In the\r\n\nInsuring Agreement  of the  general liability coverage  part, GRE\r\n\npromised to:\r\n\n     pay those sums that [Metropolitan] becomes legally obligated\r\n     to pay as damages because of `bodily injury' . .  . to which\r\n     this insurance applies. . . .  The `bodily injury'. . . must\r\n     be caused  by an `occurrence.'   The `occurrence'  must take\r\n     place in the `coverage  territory.'  We will have  the right\r\n     and duty to defend any `suit' seeking those damages.\r\n\nThere  is no  question that  the terms  `occurrence'  and `bodily\r\n\ninjury' are defined in such a way as to cover personal injury due\r\n\nto  lead paint  exposure,  and that  the  occurrences took  place\r\n\nwithin the relevant  coverage territory.   Thus, unless a  policy\r\n\nexclusion  effectively defeats  this  grant of  coverage, GRE  is\r\n\nobligated to defend and indemnify the underlying lawsuits against\r\n\nMetropolitan.\r\n\n     The district  court relied upon  two grounds, both  of which\r\n\nGRE urges upon us, for holding that there is no  coverage: first,\r\n\nthat  the  policies  are   restricted  to  liability  arising  at\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nMetropolitan's  home  office;  and second,  that  the  underlying\r\n\nclaims  fall within  a  policy exclusion  relating to  inspection\r\n\nservices.  We examine these propositions in turn.\r\n\nA.   Was Coverage Limited to Metropolitan's Office?\r                                                            \r\n\n     GRE argues that the  policy does not apply to  liability for\r\n\nclaims arising from Metropolitan's  activities away from its home\r\n\noffice, relying  upon language in the  policy's Declarations form\r\n\nand  two  supplemental schedules,  and  upon  the  amount of  the\r\n\npremium, which the district court found to be too low conceivably\r\n\nto reflect the parties' intent to cover additional risks.   \r\n\n     As for the policy  language, the \"Common Policy Declarations\r\n\nForm\"  lists certain basic information about  the policy, such as\r\n\nthe types of  coverage purchased, the  premium for each  coverage\r\n\npart, the coverage period, the name, address and type of business\r\n\nof the  insured,  the  policy number,  and  so forth.    It  also\r\n\ncontains the operative  sentence: \"In return  for the payment  of\r\n\nthe premium,  and subject to  all the  terms of  this policy,  we\r\n\nagree  with  you  to provide  the  insurance  as  stated in  this\r\n\npolicy.\"  GRE seizes on  the fact that the next line of  the form\r\n\ncalls  for a  \"business  description\" of  the  insured, which  is\r\n\nlisted as \"office,\" as evidence that only liability  arising from\r\n\nMetropolitan's  office operations was covered.   The flaw in this\r\n\nreasoning is that  the question  calls for a  description of  the\r\n\ninsured's type of business, not the premises or building to which\r                        \r\n\ninsurance was to be limited.  The fact that Metropolitan operated\r\n\nas  an office, rather than a hockey rink, manufacturing plant, or\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nboarding  house, was obviously relevant to coverage.  But it does\r\n\nnot show a clear understanding  to restrict coverage to liability\r\n\narising out of Metropolitan's office only.\r\n\n     A  somewhat closer  question is  presented by  language that\r\n\nappears in  the insurance schedules.   The \"Comprehensive General\r\n\nLiability Coverage  Declarations  Form\"  directs  the  reader  to\r\n\n\"refer to [the] common policy premises schedule for a description\r\n\nand location of all  premises owned, rented or controlled  by the\r\n\nnamed insured.\"  The \"Common Policy Premises Schedule,\" under the\r\n\nheading \"Premises,\" lists \"434 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA,\"\r\n\ni.e., the  location of  Metropolitan's office.   Further,  on the\r\n\n\"Comprehensive    General   Liability    Insurance   Supplemental\r\n\nSchedule,\"  the \"Description of Hazards Classification\" is listed\r\n\nas \"Buildings  or  Premises --  Office,\"  and the  \"Exposure\"  is\r\n\nlisted   as   \"15,000\"  square   feet,   roughly   the  area   of\r\n\nMetropolitan's  office.   GRE  argues that  this shows  that only\r\n\nthose risks arising out  of Metropolitan's office activities were\r\n\ncovered.\r\n\n     Based  on a recent decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of\r\n\nMassachusetts, however,  we cannot agree.   In Trustees  of Tufts\r                                                                           \r\n\nUniversity v.  Commercial Union  Ins. Co., the  insurance carrier\r                                                   \r\n\nargued that the failure to include a certain risk on the schedule\r\n\nof hazards to a  comprehensive general liability insurance policy\r\n\nremoved  any coverage  for  that risk.    The SJC  rejected  that\r\n\nargument,  holding   simply   that  \"nowhere   does  the   policy\r\n\nunambiguously provide  that coverage  is limited to  the specific\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nhazards listed in the schedule.\"  415 Mass. at 856, 616 N.E.2d at\r\n\n76.\r\n\n     In  the instant  case, there  is no  language in  the policy\r\n\nclearly indicating that liability  insurance is limited to claims\r\n\narising from occurrences at the premises listed  on the schedules\r\n\nfrom  which we  have  quoted.3   This absence  is made  even more\r\n\nprobative  when compared to the presence of such language on both\r\n\nthe  coverage grant description and the declarations form for the\r\n\nproperty coverage  part of the policy.   The grant of coverage on\r                  \r\n\nthe property part states  that: \"We will pay for  direct physical\r\n\nloss of or damage  to Covered Property at the  premises described\r                                                                           \r\n\nin the Declarations caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause\r                             \r\n\nof Loss\" (emphasis added).  The property declarations form, under\r\n\nthe  heading \"Coverages  Provided,\"  states  that  the  insurance\r\n\n\"applies  only to the premises  shown below, and  with respect to\r\n\nthose premises, only for the coverages, causes of loss and limits\r\n\nshown.\"    By reference  to  the  common  premises schedule,  the\r\n\n\"premises  shown  below\" is  Metropolitan's  office  space.   The\r\n\nfailure  to  include  such  language anywhere  in  the  liability\r                                                                           \r\n\ncoverage  part, under  Tufts, is  fatal to  GRE's claim  that its\r                                      \r\n\ncomprehensive liability  insurance was converted into a premises-\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3  We  reject  GRE's  citation  to  the  \"products-completed\r\noperations   hazard\"  exclusion  as  a  sufficiently  unambiguous\r\nstatement  of such  a  limitation.   As  GRE recognized  at  oral\r\nargument, that provision applies  when a completed product causes\r\ninjury  or property  damage  after it  leaves  the hands  of  its\r\nmanufacturer.   It excludes  from coverage liability  that arises\r\nafter an insured's  operations are completed, not, as  here, from\r\nthe insured's operations themselves.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nonly  liability policy simply by listing a certain premise on the\r\n\nschedule of hazards.\r\n\n     Several other considerations support our conclusion that the\r\n\nliability  insurance   was   not  limited   to   occurrences   at\r\n\nMetropolitan's  office.    First,  for  an  additional   premium,\r\n\nMetropolitan  purchased  a  so-called \"Broad  Form  Comprehensive\r\n\nLiability\"  endorsement  for  the   1990-91  policy,  which   was\r\n\nincorporated into the 1991-92  policy.  This endorsement expanded\r\n\nthe  coverage territory to \"anywhere in the world with respect to\r                                                           \r\n\n[injuries]  arising  out  of  the activities  of  [the]  insured\"\r\n\n(emphasis added).   We find  it quite unlikely  that parties  who\r\n\nintended  coverage only  for  activities at  Metropolitan's  home\r\n\noffice at 434  Massachusetts Avenue in  Boston would have  bought\r\n\nand  sold  such  an  endorsement.    Certainly,  an  \"objectively\r\n\nreasonable insured, reading [this]  policy language, would expect\r\n\nto  be covered\"  for liability  beyond that  arising at  its home\r\n\noffice.  Tufts, 415 Mass. at 849, 616 N.E.2d at 72.\r                        \r\n\n     Second,  as   part   of  its   application  for   insurance,\r\n\nMetropolitan,  through  its  broker,  made a  specific  point  of\r\n\ntelling  GRE  that it  hired outside  \"inspectors\"  to go  to the\r\n\napartments  and  determine  whether they  satisfied  the relevant\r\n\nfederal  standards  so as  to qualify  for  the subsidy.   Having\r\n\nreceived this  information, GRE sold Metropolitan  policies that,\r\n\nas  their titles  made clear,  purported to  cover \"comprehensive\r\n\ngeneral liability.\"  Thus, absent express  exclusionary language,\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nit was  reasonable for Metropolitan to believe  that its coverage\r\n\nincluded the inspectors' activities.\r\n\n     Indeed,  as we  find  infra, there  was an  endorsement, the\r                                          \r\n\nprofessional services exclusion, which may indeed have been added\r\n\nin an attempt to exclude from the grant of coverage any liability\r\n\narising  from the  inspectors' activities.   Among  other things,\r\n\nthat  endorsement  expressly  excluded from  coverage  any claims\r\n\n\"arising  out  of   the  rendering  or  failure  to   render  any\r\n\nprofessional services  . .  . including  . . .  inspection .  . .\r\n\nservices.\"  If coverage were given only to Metropolitan's  office\r\n\nactivities in the first place, there would have been no reason to\r\n\nadd this exclusion. \r\n\n     The district court  also gave weight to the relatively small\r\n\namount  of   the   premium  as   evidence  that   no  more   than\r\n\nMetropolitan's  office activities  were covered.   While  we also\r\n\nfind the  premium to  be relatively  low, we  do not  believe the\r\n\namount of the premium to be dispositive.  First, if GRE wanted to\r\n\npress  this argument  seriously, it  could have  submitted expert\r\n\ntestimony  regarding  the  premium  amount  here  versus premiums\r\n\ncharged  for comparable risks.  Instead, on this record, there is\r\n\nno  factual basis  whatsoever  upon which  to assess  whether the\r\n\npremium is low or high for the covered risks.\r\n\n     More  importantly, we can  speculate as to  many reasons for\r\n\nthe  low premium.  GRE may have concluded that Metropolitan faced\r\n\nvery  little  liability exposure  because  it  was essentially  a\r\n\ndisbursing agent for government  funds, which, even including the\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\napartment inspections, may  not have been  seen as an  enterprise\r\n\ngenerating large risks.   Or, GRE's calculus of low  exposure may\r\n\nhave been  influenced by a  Massachusetts statute, Mass.  Gen. L.\r\n\nch. 231   85K, which limits liability of non-profit organizations\r\n\nto  a $20,000 per  claim cap.   Or, it could  have calculated the\r\n\npremium erroneously, overlooking  the apartment inspection aspect\r\n\nof Metropolitan's operations.   Thus, without  a fact finding  on\r\n\nthe  circumstances  surrounding  premium  calculation   based  on\r\n\ncompetent  evidence, our general view  is that the  amount of the\r\n\npremium will  rarely be dispositive in determining  the extent of\r\n\ncoverage, for such a rule would allow  poor estimates of risk, or\r\n\ncalculations of risk based  upon mathematical error, to supersede\r\n\nthe actual coverage to which parties agreed.\r\n\n     Neither of the cases relied upon by the district court is to\r\n\nthe  contrary.  In Chesapeake  Physicians Prof. Ass.  v. The Home\r                                                                           \r\n\nIns. Co., 92  Md. App. 385,  608 A.2d 822  (1992), the court  was\r                  \r\n\nfaced  with a question similar to ours -- whether a comprehensive\r\n\ngeneral liability insurance  policy was in fact  limited to cover\r\n\nonly certain  premises -- and determined  that it was.   But that\r\n\ncourt's  holding was based upon the fact that the policy language\r\n\nitself clearly limited coverage to the premises in question.  The\r\n\n\"key language\" was  the carrier's promise to indemnify and defend\r\n\nall  claims \"arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe insured premises and all operations incidental thereto.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat  394, 608  A.2d at 826  (emphasis added).   As  we have noted,\r\n\nGRE's  liability policies have a conspicuous lack of such express\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nlanguage limiting coverage to Metropolitan's office.  It is  true\r\n\nthat  the Chesapeake  court  went  on  to  discuss  a  number  of\r                              \r\n\nconsiderations that buttressed its decision, one of which was the\r\n\nfact, also present in  our case, that the premium  was calculated\r\n\nbased  on  the  square  footage of  the  properties  and premises\r\n\ncovered.   But,  as this  was  in the  context of  a policy  that\r\n\nunambiguously limited coverage to certain premises by its express\r\n\nterms, it  has  little, if  any,  relevance to  interpreting  the\r\n\nmeaning  of the  instant  policy --  particularly  after the  SJC\r\n\ndecision in Tufts.\r                           \r\n\n     The second case, Rumford Property  and Liability Ins. Co. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCarbone, 590 A.2d  398 (R.I. 1991), is even  less persuasive.  In\r                 \r\n\nRumford, the insurance company had argued that the relatively low\r                 \r\n\npremium and the use  of only certain square footage  to calculate\r\n\nthe  premium showed that only certain premises were covered.  The\r\n\ntrial  court  rejected that  argument,  a ruling  from  which the\r                                \r\n\ninsurance company did not  even appeal.  Instead, the  only issue\r\n\non  appeal  was the  insurance  company's  alleged bad  faith  in\r\n\nrefusing to provide coverage.   In the context of  resolving that\r\n\nissue,  the Supreme  Court of  Rhode Island  stated that  the low\r\n\npremium  and the square footage calculation  created \"at least an\r\n\narguable  basis  for  denying  coverage.\"   Since  the  insurance\r\n\ncompany's  contention was \"not  a frivolous one,\"  its conduct of\r\n\nrefusing to defend and indemnify, \"while certainly not exemplary,\r\n\n. . . failed to  reach the level of  bad faith.\"  Id. at  400-01.\r                                                               \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nThus, neither Rumford nor Chesapeake persuade us that the  amount\r                                              \r\n\nof the premium is highly probative in this case.\r\n\nB.   The Professional Services Exclusion\r                                                  \r\n\n     Each  policy contains  a  professional  services  exclusion,\r\n\nwhich  removes  from  coverage  liability  \"arising  out  of  the\r\n\nrendering or  failure to render  any professional services  by or\r\n\nfor you, including .  . . supervisory, inspection  or engineering\r\n\nservices.\"    The  district  court found  that  this  endorsement\r\n\n\"plainly  omits  coverage  for any  inspection  service  (however\r                                            \r\n\n`professional'  it might  be).\"  GRE  Ins.

By  its own  plain  terms,  the  endorsement\r\n\nexcludes coverage for a broad category -- professional services -\r\n\n- and then specifies  types of excluded professional services  as\r\n\nexamples.  The  examples themselves  cannot be  broader than  the\r\n\ncategory  they exemplify; they  are nothing more  than subsets of\r\n\n\"professional  services.\"    Thus,  only  inspections   that  are\r\n\n\"professional,\" as opposed to \"nonprofessional,\" fall within  the\r\n\nendorsement.

If those claims\r\nwere removed,  it  appears that  GRE's obligation  to defend  the\r\nunderlying cases  would terminate.  See Sterilite,  17 Mass.

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the carrier, and the insured appeals.  Concluding, on the present state of the record, that the carrier must fulfill the first of these duties, i.e., the duty to defend the lawsuits, we reverse and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee GRE Insurance Group (GRE) sold the two policies at issue here to appellant Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership, Inc.  (Metropolitan), and one of its predecessor entities, Metropolitan Housing, Inc.  (MHI).  Metropolitan, like MHI before it, disburses federal and state housing subsidies to participating landlords and tenants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Metropolitan issues Certificates of Participation to eligible tenants, who then search the private rental housing market.  Once a tenant locates a suitable unit, Metropolitan steps in and negotiates the rent with the property's landlord.  Metropolitan and the landlord then enter into an agreement regarding the payment of rent subsidies, and the tenant and landlord sign a lease.  Metropolitan never becomes a party to the lease, nor acquires any possessory interest in the apartments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before agreeing to subsidize a particular apartment, Metropolitan inspects the premises to insure that federal Housing Quality Standards are satisfied.  A Metropolitan representative visits the apartment and, after visual inspection, completes a checklist confirming the number and types of rooms, whether sinks, stoves, and refrigerators are in working order, and so forth.  Metropolitan's inspectors never test for the presence of lead paint.  Instead, they simply note whether the paint is chipped or peeling, and whether the landlord has a Letter of Compliance from a licensed lead paint inspector attesting to lead paint safety.  If no letter is on file, the landlord is told that one is required before the subsidy will be given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this rather limited role, Metropolitan has been named as a defendant or third party defendant in five Massachusetts state lawsuits alleging personal injury due to lead paint exposure of minors at Metropolitan-subsidized apartments.  These suits assert a number of different legal theories against Metropolitan, many of which are based on its alleged failure to inspect adequately for lead paint before agreeing to subsidize the apartments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GRE filed this diversity action seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to defend or indemnify Metropolitan against the lawsuits, and the district court granted summary judgment in its favor.  Metropolitan now appeals.II. Analysis</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's interpretation of these insurance contracts, St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Warwick Dyeing Corp., 26 F.3d 1195, 1199 (1st Cir.1994), guided by several familiar rules of construction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We begin with the actual language of the policies and consider \"what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\"  Trustees of Tufts Univ. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 415 Mass. 844, 849, 616 N.E.2d 68, 72 (1993) (quoting Hazen Paper Co. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 407 Mass. 689, 700, 555 N.E.2d 576, 583 (1990)).  Absent ambiguity, we give policy language its plain and ordinary meaning.  E.g., Cody v. Connecticut General Life Ins. Co., 387 Mass. 142, 146, 439 N.E.2d 234, 237 (1982).  Ambiguities are resolved against the insurer, who drafted the policy, and in favor of the insured.  Thus, if \"there are two rational interpretations of policy language, the insured is entitled to the benefit of the one that is more favorable to it.\"  Hazen, 407 Mass. at 700, 555 N.E.2d at 583.   The insured bears the initial burden of proving that a claim falls within the grant of coverage, which, once established, shifts the burden onto the insurer to show the applicability of any exclusion.  Camp Dresser &amp; McKee, Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., 30 Mass.App.Ct. 318, 321, 568 N.E.2d 631, 633 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine if a liability policy obligates a carrier to defend claims made against its insured, we simply compare the underlying complaint to the policy;  \"if the allegations of the complaint are 'reasonably susceptible' of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer must undertake the defense.\"  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. SCA Services, Inc., 412 Mass. 330, 331-32, 588 N.E.2d 1346, 1347 (1992) (quoting Continental Cas. Co. v. Gilbane Bldg. Co., 391 Mass. 143, 146, 461 N.E.2d 209, 212 (1984)) (internal quotation omitted).  At issue here are two combined comprehensive general liability and commercial property insurance policies.  In the Insuring Agreement of the general liability coverage part, GRE promised to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>pay those sums that [Metropolitan] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' ... to which this insurance applies....  The 'bodily injury' ... must be caused by an 'occurrence.'   The 'occurrence' must take place in the 'coverage territory.'   We will have the right and duty to defend any 'suit' seeking those damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that the terms 'occurrence' and 'bodily injury' are defined in such a way as to cover personal injury due to lead paint exposure, and that the occurrences took place within the relevant coverage territory.  Thus, unless a policy exclusion effectively defeats this grant of coverage, GRE is obligated to defend and indemnify the underlying lawsuits against Metropolitan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court relied upon two grounds, both of which GRE urges upon us, for holding that there is no coverage:  first, that the policies are restricted to liability arising at Metropolitan's home office;  and second, that the underlying claims fall within a policy exclusion relating to inspection services.  We examine these propositions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>A. Was Coverage Limited to Metropolitan's Office?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GRE argues that the policy does not apply to liability for claims arising from Metropolitan's activities away from its home office, relying upon language in the policy's Declarations form and two supplemental schedules, and upon the amount of the premium, which the district court found to be too low conceivably to reflect the parties' intent to cover additional risks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the policy language, the \"Common Policy Declarations Form\" lists certain basic information about the policy, such as the types of coverage purchased, the premium for each coverage part, the coverage period, the name, address and type of business of the insured, the policy number, and so forth.  It also contains the operative sentence:  \"In return for the payment of the premium, and subject to all the terms of this policy, we agree with you to provide the insurance as stated in this policy.\"   GRE seizes on the fact that the next line of the form calls for a \"business description\" of the insured, which is listed as \"office,\" as evidence that only liability arising from Metropolitan's office operations was covered.  The flaw in this reasoning is that the question calls for a description of the insured's type of business, not the premises or building to which insurance was to be limited.  The fact that Metropolitan operated as an office, rather than a hockey rink, manufacturing plant, or boarding house, was obviously relevant to coverage.  But it does not show a clear understanding to restrict coverage to liability arising out of Metropolitan's office only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A somewhat closer question is presented by language that appears in the insurance schedules.  The \"Comprehensive General Liability Coverage Declarations Form\" directs the reader to \"refer to [the] common policy premises schedule for a description and location of all premises owned, rented or controlled by the named insured.\"   The \"Common Policy Premises Schedule,\" under the heading \"Premises,\" lists \"434 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA,\" i.e., the location of Metropolitan's office.  Further, on the \"Comprehensive General Liability Insurance Supplemental Schedule,\" the \"Description of Hazards Classification\" is listed as \"Buildings or Premises--Office,\" and the \"Exposure\" is listed as \"15,000\" square feet, roughly the area of Metropolitan's office.  GRE argues that this shows that only those risks arising out of Metropolitan's office activities were covered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on a recent decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, however, we cannot agree.  In Trustees of Tufts University v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., the insurance carrier argued that the failure to include a certain risk on the schedule of hazards to a comprehensive general liability insurance policy removed any coverage for that risk.  The SJC rejected that argument, holding simply that \"nowhere does the policy unambiguously provide that coverage is limited to the specific hazards listed in the schedule.\"  415 Mass. at 856, 616 N.E.2d at 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, there is no language in the policy clearly indicating that liability insurance is limited to claims arising from occurrences at the premises listed on the schedules from which we have quoted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This absence is made even more probative when compared to the presence of such language on both the coverage grant description and the declarations form for the property coverage part of the policy.  The grant of coverage on the property part states that:  \"We will pay for direct physical loss of or damage to Covered Property at the premises described in the Declarations caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss\" (emphasis added).  The property declarations form, under the heading \"Coverages Provided,\" states that the insurance \"applies only to the premises shown below, and with respect to those premises, only for the coverages, causes of loss and limits shown.\"   By reference to the common premises schedule, the \"premises shown below\" is Metropolitan's office space.  The failure to include such language anywhere in the liability coverage part, under Tufts, is fatal to GRE's claim that its comprehensive liability insurance was converted into a premises-only liability policy simply by listing a certain premise on the schedule of hazards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other considerations support our conclusion that the liability insurance was not limited to occurrences at Metropolitan's office.  First, for an additional premium, Metropolitan purchased a so-called \"Broad Form Comprehensive Liability\" endorsement for the 1990-91 policy, which was incorporated into the 1991-92 policy.  This endorsement expanded the coverage territory to \"anywhere in the world with respect to [injuries] arising out of the activities of [the] insured\" (emphasis added).  We find it quite unlikely that parties who intended coverage only for activities at Metropolitan's home office at 434 Massachusetts Avenue in Boston would have bought and sold such an endorsement.  Certainly, an \"objectively reasonable insured, reading [this] policy language, would expect to be covered\" for liability beyond that arising at its home office.  Tufts, 415 Mass. at 849, 616 N.E.2d at 72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as part of its application for insurance, Metropolitan, through its broker, made a specific point of telling GRE that it hired outside \"inspectors\" to go to the apartments and determine whether they satisfied the relevant federal standards so as to qualify for the subsidy.  Having received this information, GRE sold Metropolitan policies that, as their titles made clear, purported to cover \"comprehensive general liability.\"   Thus, absent express exclusionary language, it was reasonable for Metropolitan to believe that its coverage included the inspectors' activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, as we find infra, there was an endorsement, the professional services exclusion, which may indeed have been added in an attempt to exclude from the grant of coverage any liability arising from the inspectors' activities.  Among other things, that endorsement expressly excluded from coverage any claims \"arising out of the rendering or failure to render any professional services ... including ... inspection ... services.\"   If coverage were given only to Metropolitan's office activities in the first place, there would have been no reason to add this exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also gave weight to the relatively small amount of the premium as evidence that no more than Metropolitan's office activities were covered.  While we also find the premium to be relatively low, we do not believe the amount of the premium to be dispositive.  First, if GRE wanted to press this argument seriously, it could have submitted expert testimony regarding the premium amount here versus premiums charged for comparable risks.  Instead, on this record, there is no factual basis whatsoever upon which to assess whether the premium is low or high for the covered risks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, we can speculate as to many reasons for the low premium.  GRE may have concluded that Metropolitan faced very little liability exposure because it was essentially a disbursing agent for government funds, which, even including the apartment inspections, may not have been seen as an enterprise generating large risks.  Or, GRE's calculus of low exposure may have been influenced by a Massachusetts statute, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 231 Sec. 85K, which limits liability of non-profit organizations to a $20,000 per claim cap.  Or, it could have calculated the premium erroneously, overlooking the apartment inspection aspect of Metropolitan's operations.  Thus, without a fact finding on the circumstances surrounding premium calculation based on competent evidence, our general view is that the amount of the premium will rarely be dispositive in determining the extent of coverage, for such a rule would allow poor estimates of risk, or calculations of risk based upon mathematical error, to supersede the actual coverage to which parties agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of the cases relied upon by the district court is to the contrary.  In Chesapeake Physicians Prof.  Ass. v. The Home Ins. Co., 92 Md.App. 385, 608 A.2d 822 (1992), the court was faced with a question similar to ours--whether a comprehensive general liability insurance policy was in fact limited to cover only certain premises--and determined that it was.  But that court's holding was based upon the fact that the policy language itself clearly limited coverage to the premises in question.  The \"key language\" was the carrier's promise to indemnify and defend all claims \"arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the insured premises and all operations incidental thereto.\"  Id. at 394, 608 A.2d at 826 (emphasis added).  As we have noted, GRE's liability policies have a conspicuous lack of such express language limiting coverage to Metropolitan's office.  It is true that the Chesapeake court went on to discuss a number of considerations that buttressed its decision, one of which was the fact, also present in our case, that the premium was calculated based on the square footage of the properties and premises covered.  But, as this was in the context of a policy that unambiguously limited coverage to certain premises by its express terms, it has little, if any, relevance to interpreting the meaning of the instant policy --particularly after the SJC decision in Tufts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second case, Rumford Property and Liability Ins. Co. v. Carbone, 590 A.2d 398 (R.I.1991), is even less persuasive.  In Rumford, the insurance company had argued that the relatively low premium and the use of only certain square footage to calculate the premium showed that only certain premises were covered.  The trial court rejected that argument, a ruling from which the insurance company did not even appeal.  Instead, the only issue on appeal was the insurance company's alleged bad faith in refusing to provide coverage.  In the context of resolving that issue, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island stated that the low premium and the square footage calculation created \"at least an arguable basis for denying coverage.\"   Since the insurance company's contention was \"not a frivolous one,\" its conduct of refusing to defend and indemnify, \"while certainly not exemplary, ... failed to reach the level of bad faith.\"  Id. at 400-01.   Thus, neither Rumford nor Chesapeake persuade us that the amount of the premium is highly probative in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Professional Services Exclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each policy contains a professional services exclusion, which removes from coverage liability \"arising out of the rendering or failure to render any professional services by or for you, including ... supervisory, inspection or engineering services.\"   The district court found that this endorsement \"plainly omits coverage for any inspection service (however 'professional' it might be).\"  GRE Ins. Group v. Metropolitan Boston Housing Part., Inc., No. 93-11727-RGS, slip op. at 6 (D.Mass. Aug. 11, 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  By its own plain terms, the endorsement excludes coverage for a broad category--professional services--and then specifies types of excluded professional services as examples.  The examples themselves cannot be broader than the category they exemplify;  they are nothing more than subsets of \"professional services.\"   Thus, only inspections that are \"professional,\" as opposed to \"nonprofessional,\" fall within the endorsement.  See Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. McFadden, 413 Mass. 90, 92, 95, 595 N.E.2d 762, 764, 765 (1992) (employing similar reasoning in finding that lead paint exposure was not within pollution exclusion, which defined pollutant as \"any contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste,\" because of additional requirement of \"discharge, dispersal, release or escape\" of pollutant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Roe v. Federal Ins. Co., 412 Mass. 43, 587 N.E.2d 214 (1992), the Supreme Judicial Court applied a formulation for assessing the applicability of a professional services exclusion that we find instructive in the instant case.  To be engaged in professional services,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>\"[s]omething more than an act flowing from mere employment or vocation is essential.  The act or service must be such as exacts the use or application of special learning or attainments of some kind.  The term 'professional' ... means something more than mere proficiency in the performance of a task and implies intellectual skill....  A 'professional' act or service is one arising out of a vocation, calling, occupation, or employment involving specialized knowledge, labor, or skill and the labor or skill involved is predominantly mental or intellectual, rather than physical or manual....  In determining whether a particular act is ... a 'professional service' we must look not to the title or character of the party performing the act, but to the act itself.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">412 Mass. at 48, 587 N.E.2d at 217 (quoting Marx v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., 183 Neb. 12, 13, 157 N.W.2d 870, 872 (1968) (citations omitted)).  The cases collected in Roe all analyze the applicability of professional services exclusions by determining whether the relevant activity was \"professional\" in nature.  See Harad v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 839 F.2d 979, 984 (3d Cir.1988) (professional services exclusion applies to attorney's preparation and filing of pleadings);  Curtis Ambulance v. Shawnee County Bd. of Comm'rs., 811 F.2d 1371, 1379-84 (10th Cir.1987) (professional services exclusion applies to ambulance personnel's provision of emergency medical services);  Bank of California, N.A. v. Opie, 663 F.2d 977, 981-82 (9th Cir.1981) (professional services exclusion applies to mortgage broker's management of loan proceeds).  Therefore, we reverse the district court's decision that all inspections were necessarily excluded under this endorsement, and remand for a determination of whether, under Massachusetts law, Metropolitan's inspectors performed professional services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Metropolitan's inspections are found to be professional in nature, however, GRE would still have to defend the underlying lawsuits--at least initially.  This is so because, after reviewing the complaints filed against Metropolitan, we find that some of the claims raise legal theories of recovery broader than inadequate inspections.  Taken collectively, the claims include negligence, negligent misrepresentation, negligently creating a lead paint risk, failing to require an owner to take corrective action, failing to correct a lead paint hazard, failure to obtain certificates of compliance with the lead paint law, and breach of contract and/or the implied covenant of habitability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least on their face, these claims are \"reasonably susceptible\" of being read to \"state or adumbrate\" claims that are beyond the inspection services exclusion.  Liberty Mutual, 412 Mass. at 330, 588 N.E.2d at 1347 (quoting Continental Cas., 391 Mass. at 146, 461 N.E.2d at 212).   For example, the claimed failure to correct a lead paint risk appears to rest on the theory that the very provision of rent subsidies carried with it the responsibility to make whatever lead paint safety improvements were necessary.  Other claims might be based on the theory that the inspections were all perfectly adequate, but Metropolitan's follow up with the landlords was lacking.  See Sterilite Corp. v. Continental Cas. Co., 17 Mass.App.Ct. 316, 318, 458 N.E.2d 338, 341 (1983) (\"[T]he process is one of envisaging what kind of losses may be proved as lying within the range of the allegations of the complaint, and then seeing whether any such loss fits the expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy.\")  (emphasis added);  cf.  Complaint of Stone Petroleum Corp., 961 F.2d 90, 91-92 (5th Cir.1992) (general liability insurer must defend suits because they contain claims that, liberally construed, are beyond the professional services exclusion).  We express no view on whether such expansive theories ultimately will be successful against Metropolitan, and thus GRE.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, because certain of the claims are not within the professional services exclusion, GRE is obligated to defend the underlying suits notwithstanding the possibility that certain other claims might be found to be excluded.  See Camp Dresser, 30 Mass.App.Ct. at 323, 568 N.E.2d at 634 (imposing a duty to defend despite the fact that \"many of the complaint allegations fell within the exclusion\");  see also Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co. v. Continental Cas. Co., 413 Mass. 730, 732 n. 1, 604 N.E.2d 30, 32 n. 1 (1992) (noting that \"the weight of authority places the duty to defend all counts on an insurer which has a duty to defend at least one count of a complaint\").  As the Camp Dresser court indicated, an insurer in this position may \"undertake the defense of the underlying action with a reservation of rights with respect to the excludable claims\" or it may share respective defense responsibilities with co-counsel.  30 Mass.App.Ct. at 323 n. 4, 568 N.E.2d at 634 n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the inspections are found to fall within the professional services exclusion, GRE would be obligated to defend the suits against Metropolitan until the non-excludable claims are resolved,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> or an arrangement such as contemplated by the Camp Dresser court is established, and would have to indemnify only if Metropolitan were found liable on a non-excludable claim.  If the inspections are found not to be professional services, GRE would have to defend the suits and indemnify Metropolitan for any successful claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court in favor of GRE is reversed.  The case is remanded for entry of judgment in favor of Metropolitan on the duty to defend, and for a determination consistent with this opinion of whether Metropolitan's inspections were professional in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> MHI and Metropolitan were formed to privatize the functions previously performed by the Metropolitan Housing Assistance Program of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The parties agree that Massachusetts law controls</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We reject GRE's citation to the \"products-completed operations hazard\" exclusion as a sufficiently unambiguous statement of such a limitation.  As GRE recognized at oral argument, that provision applies when a completed product causes injury or property damage after it leaves the hands of its manufacturer.  It excludes from coverage liability that arises after an insured's operations are completed, not, as here, from the insured's operations themselves</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Nor need we, for GRE agreed to defend suits within the grant of coverage \"even if the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In this case, we would imagine that GRE could test the viability of those claims that do not rely exclusively on alleged inadequate inspections by way of early motion to dismiss or for summary judgment in the underlying state cases.  If those claims were removed, it appears that GRE's obligation to defend the underlying cases would terminate.  See Sterilite, 17 Mass.App.Ct. at 323-24 (the duty to defend ceases if and when the insurer demonstrates that no claim asserted within the grant of coverage can be successful in the underlying action);  see also Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Belleville Ind., Inc., 407 Mass. 675, 685-86, 555 N.E.2d 568, 575 (1990) (citing Ster ilite approvingly).

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the carrier, and the insured appeals.  Concluding, on the present state of the record, that the carrier must fulfill the first of these duties, i.e., the duty to defend the lawsuits, we reverse and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee GRE Insurance Group (GRE) sold the two policies at issue here to appellant Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership, Inc.  (Metropolitan), and one of its predecessor entities, Metropolitan Housing, Inc.  (MHI).  Metropolitan, like MHI before it, disburses federal and state housing subsidies to participating landlords and tenants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Metropolitan issues Certificates of Participation to eligible tenants, who then search the private rental housing market.  Once a tenant locates a suitable unit, Metropolitan steps in and negotiates the rent with the property's landlord.  Metropolitan and the landlord then enter into an agreement regarding the payment of rent subsidies, and the tenant and landlord sign a lease.  Metropolitan never becomes a party to the lease, nor acquires any possessory interest in the apartments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before agreeing to subsidize a particular apartment, Metropolitan inspects the premises to insure that federal Housing Quality Standards are satisfied.  A Metropolitan representative visits the apartment and, after visual inspection, completes a checklist confirming the number and types of rooms, whether sinks, stoves, and refrigerators are in working order, and so forth.  Metropolitan's inspectors never test for the presence of lead paint.  Instead, they simply note whether the paint is chipped or peeling, and whether the landlord has a Letter of Compliance from a licensed lead paint inspector attesting to lead paint safety.  If no letter is on file, the landlord is told that one is required before the subsidy will be given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this rather limited role, Metropolitan has been named as a defendant or third party defendant in five Massachusetts state lawsuits alleging personal injury due to lead paint exposure of minors at Metropolitan-subsidized apartments.  These suits assert a number of different legal theories against Metropolitan, many of which are based on its alleged failure to inspect adequately for lead paint before agreeing to subsidize the apartments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GRE filed this diversity action seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to defend or indemnify Metropolitan against the lawsuits, and the district court granted summary judgment in its favor.

At issue here are two combined comprehensive general liability and commercial property insurance policies.  In the Insuring Agreement of the general liability coverage part, GRE promised to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>pay those sums that [Metropolitan] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' ... to which this insurance applies....  The 'bodily injury' ... must be caused by an 'occurrence.'   The 'occurrence' must take place in the 'coverage territory.'   We will have the right and duty to defend any 'suit' seeking those damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that the terms 'occurrence' and 'bodily injury' are defined in such a way as to cover personal injury due to lead paint exposure, and that the occurrences took place within the relevant coverage territory.  Thus, unless a policy exclusion effectively defeats this grant of coverage, GRE is obligated to defend and indemnify the underlying lawsuits against Metropolitan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court relied upon two grounds, both of which GRE urges upon us, for holding that there is no coverage:  first, that the policies are restricted to liability arising at Metropolitan's home office;  and second, that the underlying claims fall within a policy exclusion relating to inspection services.  We examine these propositions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>A. Was Coverage Limited to Metropolitan's Office?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GRE argues that the policy does not apply to liability for claims arising from Metropolitan's activities away from its home office, relying upon language in the policy's Declarations form and two supplemental schedules, and upon the amount of the premium, which the district court found to be too low conceivably to reflect the parties' intent to cover additional risks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the policy language, the \"Common Policy Declarations Form\" lists certain basic information about the policy, such as the types of coverage purchased, the premium for each coverage part, the coverage period, the name, address and type of business of the insured, the policy number, and so forth.  It also contains the operative sentence:  \"In return for the payment of the premium, and subject to all the terms of this policy, we agree with you to provide the insurance as stated in this policy.\"   GRE seizes on the fact that the next line of the form calls for a \"business description\" of the insured, which is listed as \"office,\" as evidence that only liability arising from Metropolitan's office operations was covered.  The flaw in this reasoning is that the question calls for a description of the insured's type of business, not the premises or building to which insurance was to be limited.  The fact that Metropolitan operated as an office, rather than a hockey rink, manufacturing plant, or boarding house, was obviously relevant to coverage.  But it does not show a clear understanding to restrict coverage to liability arising out of Metropolitan's office only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A somewhat closer question is presented by language that appears in the insurance schedules.  The \"Comprehensive General Liability Coverage Declarations Form\" directs the reader to \"refer to [the] common policy premises schedule for a description and location of all premises owned, rented or controlled by the named insured.\"   The \"Common Policy Premises Schedule,\" under the heading \"Premises,\" lists \"434 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA,\" i.e., the location of Metropolitan's office.  Further, on the \"Comprehensive General Liability Insurance Supplemental Schedule,\" the \"Description of Hazards Classification\" is listed as \"Buildings or Premises--Office,\" and the \"Exposure\" is listed as \"15,000\" square feet, roughly the area of Metropolitan's office.  GRE argues that this shows that only those risks arising out of Metropolitan's office activities were covered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on a recent decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, however, we cannot agree.  In Trustees of Tufts University v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., the insurance carrier argued that the failure to include a certain risk on the schedule of hazards to a comprehensive general liability insurance policy removed any coverage for that risk.  The SJC rejected that argument, holding simply that \"nowhere does the policy unambiguously provide that coverage is limited to the specific hazards listed in the schedule.\"  415 Mass. at 856, 616 N.E.2d at 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, there is no language in the policy clearly indicating that liability insurance is limited to claims arising from occurrences at the premises listed on the schedules from which we have quoted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This absence is made even more probative when compared to the presence of such language on both the coverage grant description and the declarations form for the property coverage part of the policy.  The grant of coverage on the property part states that:  \"We will pay for direct physical loss of or damage to Covered Property at the premises described in the Declarations caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss\" (emphasis added).  The property declarations form, under the heading \"Coverages Provided,\" states that the insurance \"applies only to the premises shown below, and with respect to those premises, only for the coverages, causes of loss and limits shown.\"   By reference to the common premises schedule, the \"premises shown below\" is Metropolitan's office space.  The failure to include such language anywhere in the liability coverage part, under Tufts, is fatal to GRE's claim that its comprehensive liability insurance was converted into a premises-only liability policy simply by listing a certain premise on the schedule of hazards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other considerations support our conclusion that the liability insurance was not limited to occurrences at Metropolitan's office.  First, for an additional premium, Metropolitan purchased a so-called \"Broad Form Comprehensive Liability\" endorsement for the 1990-91 policy, which was incorporated into the 1991-92 policy.  This endorsement expanded the coverage territory to \"anywhere in the world with respect to [injuries] arising out of the activities of [the] insured\" (emphasis added).  We find it quite unlikely that parties who intended coverage only for activities at Metropolitan's home office at 434 Massachusetts Avenue in Boston would have bought and sold such an endorsement.  Certainly, an \"objectively reasonable insured, reading [this] policy language, would expect to be covered\" for liability beyond that arising at its home office.  Tufts, 415 Mass. at 849, 616 N.E.2d at 72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as part of its application for insurance, Metropolitan, through its broker, made a specific point of telling GRE that it hired outside \"inspectors\" to go to the apartments and determine whether they satisfied the relevant federal standards so as to qualify for the subsidy.  Having received this information, GRE sold Metropolitan policies that, as their titles made clear, purported to cover \"comprehensive general liability.\"   Thus, absent express exclusionary language, it was reasonable for Metropolitan to believe that its coverage included the inspectors' activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, as we find infra, there was an endorsement, the professional services exclusion, which may indeed have been added in an attempt to exclude from the grant of coverage any liability arising from the inspectors' activities.  Among other things, that endorsement expressly excluded from coverage any claims \"arising out of the rendering or failure to render any professional services ... including ... inspection ... services.\"   If coverage were given only to Metropolitan's office activities in the first place, there would have been no reason to add this exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also gave weight to the relatively small amount of the premium as evidence that no more than Metropolitan's office activities were covered.  While we also find the premium to be relatively low, we do not believe the amount of the premium to be dispositive.  First, if GRE wanted to press this argument seriously, it could have submitted expert testimony regarding the premium amount here versus premiums charged for comparable risks.  Instead, on this record, there is no factual basis whatsoever upon which to assess whether the premium is low or high for the covered risks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, we can speculate as to many reasons for the low premium.  GRE may have concluded that Metropolitan faced very little liability exposure because it was essentially a disbursing agent for government funds, which, even including the apartment inspections, may not have been seen as an enterprise generating large risks.  Or, GRE's calculus of low exposure may have been influenced by a Massachusetts statute, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 231 Sec. 85K, which limits liability of non-profit organizations to a $20,000 per claim cap.  Or, it could have calculated the premium erroneously, overlooking the apartment inspection aspect of Metropolitan's operations.  Thus, without a fact finding on the circumstances surrounding premium calculation based on competent evidence, our general view is that the amount of the premium will rarely be dispositive in determining the extent of coverage, for such a rule would allow poor estimates of risk, or calculations of risk based upon mathematical error, to supersede the actual coverage to which parties agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of the cases relied upon by the district court is to the contrary.  In Chesapeake Physicians Prof.  Ass. v. The Home Ins. Co., 92 Md.App. 385, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1901715\"><a href=\"/opinion/1901715/chesapeake-physicians-professional-assn-v-home-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span> (1992), the court was faced with a question similar to ours--whether a comprehensive general liability insurance policy was in fact limited to cover only certain premises--and determined that it was.  But that court's holding was based upon the fact that the policy language itself clearly limited coverage to the premises in question.  The \"key language\" was the carrier's promise to indemnify and defend all claims \"arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the insured premises and all operations incidental thereto.\"  Id. at 394, 608 A.2d at 826 (emphasis added).  As we have noted, GRE's liability policies have a conspicuous lack of such express language limiting coverage to Metropolitan's office.  It is true that the Chesapeake court went on to discuss a number of considerations that buttressed its decision, one of which was the fact, also present in our case, that the premium was calculated based on the square footage of the properties and premises covered.  But, as this was in the context of a policy that unambiguously limited coverage to certain premises by its express terms, it has little, if any, relevance to interpreting the meaning of the instant policy --particularly after the SJC decision in Tufts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second case, Rumford Property and Liability Ins.

In Rumford, the insurance company had argued that the relatively low premium and the use of only certain square footage to calculate the premium showed that only certain premises were covered.  The trial court rejected that argument, a ruling from which the insurance company did not even appeal.  Instead, the only issue on appeal was the insurance company's alleged bad faith in refusing to provide coverage.  In the context of resolving that issue, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island stated that the low premium and the square footage calculation created \"at least an arguable basis for denying coverage.\"   Since the insurance company's contention was \"not a frivolous one,\" its conduct of refusing to defend and indemnify, \"while certainly not exemplary, ... failed to reach the level of bad faith.\"  Id. at 400-01.   Thus, neither Rumford nor Chesapeake persuade us that the amount of the premium is highly probative in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Professional Services Exclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each policy contains a professional services exclusion, which removes from coverage liability \"arising out of the rendering or failure to render any professional services by or for you, including ... supervisory, inspection or engineering services.\"   The district court found that this endorsement \"plainly omits coverage for any inspection service (however 'professional' it might be).\"  GRE Ins. Group v. Metropolitan Boston Housing Part., Inc., No. 93-11727-RGS, slip op. at 6 (D.Mass. Aug. 11, 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  By its own plain terms, the endorsement excludes coverage for a broad category--professional services--and then specifies types of excluded professional services as examples.  The examples themselves cannot be broader than the category they exemplify;  they are nothing more than subsets of \"professional services.\"   Thus, only inspections that are \"professional,\" as opposed to \"nonprofessional,\" fall within the endorsement.  See Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. McFadden, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2219753\"><a href=\"/opinion/2219753/atlantic-mutual-ins-co-v-mcfadden/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 92, 95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2219753\"><a href=\"/opinion/2219753/atlantic-mutual-ins-co-v-mcfadden/\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></a></span>, 764, 765 (1992) (employing similar reasoning in finding that lead paint exposure was not within pollution exclusion, which defined pollutant as \"any contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste,\" because of additional requirement of \"discharge, dispersal, release or escape\" of pollutant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Roe v.

To be engaged in professional services,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>\"[s]omething more than an act flowing from mere employment or vocation is essential.  The act or service must be such as exacts the use or application of special learning or attainments of some kind.  The term 'professional' ... means something more than mere proficiency in the performance of a task and implies intellectual skill....  A 'professional' act or service is one arising out of a vocation, calling, occupation, or employment involving specialized knowledge, labor, or skill and the labor or skill involved is predominantly mental or intellectual, rather than physical or manual....  In determining whether a particular act is ... a 'professional service' we must look not to the title or character of the party performing the act, but to the act itself.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">412 Mass. at 48, 587 N.E.2d at 217 (quoting Marx v.

The cases collected in Roe all analyze the applicability of professional services exclusions by determining whether the relevant activity was \"professional\" in nature.  See Harad v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.

Therefore, we reverse the district court's decision that all inspections were necessarily excluded under this endorsement, and remand for a determination of whether, under Massachusetts law, Metropolitan's inspectors performed professional services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Metropolitan's inspections are found to be professional in nature, however, GRE would still have to defend the underlying lawsuits--at least initially.  This is so because, after reviewing the complaints filed against Metropolitan, we find that some of the claims raise legal theories of recovery broader than inadequate inspections.  Taken collectively, the claims include negligence, negligent misrepresentation, negligently creating a lead paint risk, failing to require an owner to take corrective action, failing to correct a lead paint hazard, failure to obtain certificates of compliance with the lead paint law, and breach of contract and/or the implied covenant of habitability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least on their face, these claims are \"reasonably susceptible\" of being read to \"state or adumbrate\" claims that are beyond the inspection services exclusion.  Liberty Mutual, 412 Mass. at 330, 588 N.E.2d at 1347 (quoting Continental Cas., 391 Mass. at 146, 461 N.E.2d at 212).   For example, the claimed failure to correct a lead paint risk appears to rest on the theory that the very provision of rent subsidies carried with it the responsibility to make whatever lead paint safety improvements were necessary.  Other claims might be based on the theory that the inspections were all perfectly adequate, but Metropolitan's follow up with the landlords was lacking.  See Sterilite Corp. v. Continental Cas. Co., 17 Mass.App.Ct. 316, 318, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2241147\"><a href=\"/opinion/2241147/sterilite-corp-v-continental-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span>, 341 (1983) (\"[T]he process is one of envisaging what kind of losses may be proved as lying within the range of the allegations of the complaint, and then seeing whether any such loss fits the expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy.\")  (emphasis added);  cf.  Complaint of Stone Petroleum Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580938\"><a href=\"/opinion/580938/in-the-matter-of-the-complaint-of-stone-petroleum-corporation-as-owner-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 91-92 (5th Cir.1992) (general liability insurer must defend suits because they contain claims that, liberally construed, are beyond the professional services exclusion).  We express no view on whether such expansive theories ultimately will be successful against Metropolitan, and thus GRE.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, because certain of the claims are not within the professional services exclusion, GRE is obligated to defend the underlying suits notwithstanding the possibility that certain other claims might be found to be excluded.  See Camp Dresser, 30 Mass.App.Ct. at 323, 568 N.E.2d at 634 (imposing a duty to defend despite the fact that \"many of the complaint allegations fell within the exclusion\");  see also Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co. v. Continental Cas. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2037662\"><a href=\"/opinion/2037662/aetna-casualty-surety-co-v-continental-cas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span>, 732 n. 1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2037662\"><a href=\"/opinion/2037662/aetna-casualty-surety-co-v-continental-cas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 32 n. 1 (1992) (noting that \"the weight of authority places the duty to defend all counts on an insurer which has a duty to defend at least one count of a complaint\").  As the Camp Dresser court indicated, an insurer in this position may \"undertake the defense of the underlying action with a reservation of rights with respect to the excludable claims\" or it may share respective defense responsibilities with co-counsel.  30 Mass.App.Ct. at 323 n. 4, 568 N.E.2d at 634 n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the inspections are found to fall within the professional services exclusion, GRE would be obligated to defend the suits against Metropolitan until the non-excludable claims are resolved,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> or an arrangement such as contemplated by the Camp Dresser court is established, and would have to indemnify only if Metropolitan were found liable on a non-excludable claim.  If the inspections are found not to be professional services, GRE would have to defend the suits and indemnify Metropolitan for any successful claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court in favor of GRE is reversed.  The case is remanded for entry of judgment in favor of Metropolitan on the duty to defend, and for a determination consistent with this opinion of whether Metropolitan's inspections were professional in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> MHI and Metropolitan were formed to privatize the functions previously performed by the Metropolitan Housing Assistance Program of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The parties agree that Massachusetts law controls</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We reject GRE's citation to the \"products-completed operations hazard\" exclusion as a sufficiently unambiguous statement of such a limitation.  As GRE recognized at oral argument, that provision applies when a completed product causes injury or property damage after it leaves the hands of its manufacturer.  It excludes from coverage liability that arises after an insured's operations are completed, not, as here, from the insured's operations themselves</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Nor need we, for GRE agreed to defend suits within the grant of coverage \"even if the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In this case, we would imagine that GRE could test the viability of those claims that do not rely exclusively on alleged inadequate inspections by way of early motion to dismiss or for summary judgment in the underlying state cases.  If those claims were removed, it appears that GRE's obligation to defend the underlying cases would terminate.  See Sterilite, 17 Mass.App.Ct. at 323-24 (the duty to defend ceases if and when the insurer demonstrates that no claim asserted within the grant of coverage can be successful in the underlying action);  see also Lumbermens Mut.
