Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Jose Luis Cintron Moreno on brief pro se.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           March 22, 2001\n\f          Per Curiam. Jose Luis Cintron Moreno appeals pro se\n\nfrom the summary denial of a motion for return of property\n\nfiled pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e) some months after\n\nthe completion of criminal proceedings against him.      The\n\nappeal is timely because such motions should be treated as\n\ncivil, equitable actions, see United States v. Giraldo, 45\n\nF.3d 509, 511 (1st Cir. 1995), and, thus, the sixty-day time\n\nperiod under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B) applies, see United\n\nStates v. Bein, 214 F.3d 408, 411 n.3 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing\n\ncases).   Cintron Moreno's notice of appeal was filed well\n\nwithin the sixty-day period.   For the following reasons, we\n\nvacate and remand.\n\n          In his filings before the district court, Cintron\n\nMoreno sought the return of various personal and business\n\nproperty including checks, cash, jewelry, a pickup truck,\n\ntwo cellular phones, a black sport pouch, credit cards,\n\nlottery tickets, business records, various licenses and\n\nidentification cards, and miscellaneous other items.    Most\n\nof this property was allegedly seized during a search of\n\nCintron Moreno's residence on April 9, 1997.   Cintron Moreno\n\nrequested that these items be returned to his daughters,\n\nthrough his attorney, and not his step-daughter.   He stated\n\n\n                            -2-\n\f that he had never received notice of forfeiture with respect\n\n to the pickup truck but that it was being used by federal\n\n agents.1\n\n             The government moved to dismiss representing that,\n\n approximately one month prior to the filing of the Rule\n\n 41(e) motion, the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\")\n\n had returned to Cintron Moreno's step-daughter 17 cardboard\n\n boxes \"containing all the documents impounded during the\n\n search and seizure of April 9, 199[7].\"        In support of this\n\n representation, the government produced a copy of a signed\n\n receipt.    The government further represented that no jewelry\n\n was seized from Cintron Moreno.      In support of this latter\n\n representation, the government produced a five page DEA\n\n search warrant inventory list (which does not list any\n\n jewelry).     The list indicates that at least 21 boxes of\n\n items were seized from Cintron Moreno's residence.       Finally,\n\n the    government   represented   that   it   \"had   reviewed   all\n\n administrative forfeitures from 11/1/97 to 11/2/99 and the\n\n aforementioned vehicle has not been seized or forfeited by\n\n the government.\"\n\n\n    1On appeal, Cintron mentions for the first time that the\nblack sport pouch contained a pistol and ammunition. However,\nin response to the government's argument that, as a convicted\nfelon, he cannot lawfully possess a firearm or ammunition, he\ndisavows any claim to return of these particular items.\n\n                               -3-\n\f            Cintron Moreno filed a reply to the government in\n\nwhich he argued, inter alia, that since the inventory list\n\nreveals   that    at   least      21    boxes     were   removed       from    his\n\nresidence, not all of the seized property could have been\n\nreturned to his step-daughter.               He further suggested that\n\nthe   inventory    list   was     incomplete,        and   he    stated       that\n\njewelry had been removed from his person at the time of his\n\narrest.     Cintron Moreno complained that he had never given\n\npermission for his property to be returned to his step-\n\ndaughter.        Finally,    he        objected    to    the    government's\n\nrepresentation     that     his    vehicle        had    not    been    seized,\n\nsuggesting that it had been seized by the United States\n\nCustoms Service.\n\n            Based on this record, we think that summary denial\n\nof the motion for return of property was inappropriate.                        The\n\ngovernment has never explained the discrepancy between the\n\nnumber of boxes seized (21) and the number of boxes returned\n\n(17).   Although the government insists that no currency was\n\nseized, the DEA search warrant inventory list indicates that\n\nover $ 500 in currency was seized from the residence.                           We\n\nthink that there was insufficient evidence from which the\n\ndistrict court could conclude that everything seized, and\n\nnot properly retained, was returned.                     In addition, the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fgovernment now concedes that Cintron Moreno's pickup truck\n\nwas   administratively           forfeited       by     Customs      on     some\n\nunspecified date.                On remand, the district court must\n\ndetermine     whether,      in   fact,    the    government      retains     any\n\nproperty, and if not, what happened to it.                        See     United\n\nStates v. Chambers, 192 F.3d 374, 378 (3d Cir. 1999); United\n\nStates v. Rufu, 20 F.3d 63, 64 (2d Cir. 1994) (per curiam).\n\nThe court must also determine whether it was proper to\n\nreturn property to Cintron Moreno's step-daughter.                           Cf.\n\nChambers, 192 F.3d at 378 (requiring district court to\n\ndetermine whether it was proper to surrender property to\n\nthird party).           Further, inasmuch as Cintron Moreno has\n\nasserted that he was not provided notice of the forfeiture\n\nof his vehicle, the district court should permit him to\n\namend his motion to assert this collateral attack on the\n\nforfeiture.       See id.\n\n            If     the    district       court    determines       that      the\n\ngovernment lost or improperly disposed of property, it shall\n\ndetermine        what     remedies,       if     any,     are     available.\n\nCompare Mora v. United States, 955 F.2d 156, 159-160 (2d\n\nCir. 1992) (damages available); United States v. Martinson,\n\n809 F.2d 1364, 1368 (9th Cir. 1987) (same)                    with        United\n\nStates   v.   Jones,      225    F.3d    468,    469-70   (4th    Cir.     2000)\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f(damages not available), petition for cert. filed, (U.S.\n\nDec. 12, 2000) (No. 00-7542); United States v.

We intimate no\n\nopinion in this regard.\n\n          Finally, to the extent that Cintron Moreno is\n\nattempting on appeal to challenge the forfeiture of certain\n\nreal estate, this issue is foreclosed.            A final order of\n\nforfeiture as to the real estate entered on May 25, 1999.\n\nCintron Moreno filed a tardy notice of appeal from this\n\norder, and this court dismissed the appeal for lack of\n\njurisdiction.    United States v. Cintron Moreno, No. 00-1391\n\n(1st Cir. May 1, 2000) (unpublished judgment).               Cintron\n\nMoreno cannot now attempt to insinuate the issue into this\n\nappeal   from   the   denial   of   a   motion   seeking   return   of\n\npersonal and business property.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
