LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  In September 1996, the Cool Moose\r\nParty (\"CMP\"), a Rhode Island political party, and Robert J.\r\nHealey, Jr. individually and in his capacity as CMP's chairperson\r\n(referred to collectively herein as \"CMP\"), filed suit in federal\r\ndistrict court pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983 seeking declaratory and\r\ninjunctive relief from various provisions of Rhode Island's primary\r\nelection laws, R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-1 to 17-15-44.  After the\r\nparties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on a stipulated\r\nrecord, the district court ruled, inter alia, that R.I. Gen. Laws\r\n17-15-6, which requires political parties to select their\r\nnominees by means of primary election, is constitutional; and that\r\nR.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-24, which prohibits members of one political\r\nparty from voting in another party's primary, is unconstitutional\r\nto the extent that it prohibits such voters from participating in\r\na party primary when the bylaws of that party would permit such\r\nparticipation.  Both parties now appeal the adverse judgments\r\nagainst them.  We affirm.    \r\nThe Questions Presented\r\nWe note at the outset that CMP's challenges to Rhode\r\nIsland's primary election statutes both in the district court and\r\non appeal contain ambiguities which limit our ability to address\r\nits contentions and restrict the scope of our analysis.  As the\r\ndistrict court observed, CMP's pleadings and arguments \"are\r\ndifficult to decipher and do not clearly state the precise nature\r\nof the constitutional violations alleged.\" Cool Moose Party v.\r\nRhode Island, 6 F. Supp. 2d 116, 119 (D.R.I. 1998). \r\nNotwithstanding this lack of clarity, the district court identified\r\nfive issues that appeared to be raised by CMP, see id., two of\r\nwhich are appealed here: \r\n  (1) Whether R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-6, which\r\nrequires political parties to select their\r\nnominees by means of primary elections,\r\nviolates CMP members' right to freedom of\r\nassociation by preventing them from selecting\r\ncandidates at a caucus open only to CMP\r\nmembers.\r\n\n  (2) Whether R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-24, which\r\nprohibits members of one political party from\r\nvoting in another party's primary, violates\r\nthe plaintiffs' right to freedom of\r\nassociation because it prevents CMP from\r\nallowing members of other parties to\r\nparticipate in the selection of CMP\r\ncandidates.\r\n\nId.  On appeal the parties apparently agree with the district\r\ncourt's characterization of the issues presented, and we proceed\r\naccordingly.  We review a district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment de novo.  See Lennon v. Rubin, 166 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir.\r\n1999).\r\n\nThe Constitutional Background\r\nThe freedom to associate with others for the advancement\r\nof political beliefs and ideas is a form of \"orderly group\r\nactivity\" protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and\r\n\"[t]he right to associate with the political party of one's choice\r\nis an integral part of this basic constitutional freedom.\" Kusper\r\nv. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 56-57 (1973); see Tashjian v. Republican\r\nParty of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 214 (1986); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S.\r\n347, 356 (1976); NAACP v. Alabama ex. rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449,\r\n460 (1958).  Those associational rights, however, \"are necessarily\r\nsubject to qualification if elections are to be run fairly and\r\neffectively.\"  Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, 193\r\n(1986); see Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 117 S. Ct. 1364,\r\n1369-70 (1997); Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730 (1974).  Thus,\r\nstates may enact laws that are necessary to ensure the integrity,\r\nfairness, and honesty of the election process, see Eu v. San\r\nFrancisco County Democratic Cent. Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 231 (1989),\r\neven though such laws may abridge a party's associational rights by\r\ninterfering with its internal affairs or its ability to garner\r\nsupport and members, see, e.g., Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 300,\r\n343-44 (1972) (residence requirement); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S.\r\n112, 118 (1970) (age minimum); Kramer v. Union Free Sch. Dist. No.\r\n15, 395 U.S. 621, 625 (1969) (citizenship requirement).      \r\nFaced with the inherent tension between a political\r\nparty's right of association and a state's power to regulate\r\nelections, the Supreme Court has endorsed a flexible standard of\r\nreview applicable to a challenged provision corresponding roughly\r\nto the degree to which the provision affects First and Fourteenth\r\nAmendment rights:\r\n  When deciding whether a state election law\r\nviolates the First and Fourteenth Amendment\r\nassociational rights, we weigh the character \r\nand magnitude of the burden the State's rule\r\nimposes on those rights against the interests\r\nthe State contends justify that burden, and\r\nconsider the extent to which the State's\r\nconcerns make the burden necessary. \r\nRegulations imposing severe burdens on\r\nplaintiffs' rights must be narrowly tailored\r\nand advance a compelling state interest. \r\nLesser burdens, however, trigger less exacting\r\nreview, and a State's important regulatory\r\ninterests will usually be enough to justify\r\nreasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.  \r\n\nTimmons, 117 S. Ct. at 1370 (internal quotation marks and citations\r\nomitted); see also Werme v. Merrill, 84 F.3d 479, 483 (1st Cir.\r\n1996). Under this formulation, \"no bright line separates\r\npermissible election-related regulation from unconstitutional\r\ninfringements on First Amendment freedoms.\"  Timmons, 117 S. Ct. at\r\n1370.   \r\nThe Primary Requirement\r\nCMP contends that R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-6, which\r\nrequires that parties select their nominees by primary election\r\nrather than by party convention or caucus, is unconstitutional.\r\nAlthough we have considerable difficulty deciphering CMP's\r\nargument, CMP on appeal appears to accept the proposition that\r\nstates may require parties to select their nominees by primary\r\nelection without violating the parties' First Amendment\r\nassociational rights.  See, e.g., Reply Br. at 6.  Rather, CMP now\r\nmakes a vague equal protection challenge to the primary\r\nrequirement, contending that although Rhode Island \"may mandate a\r\nprimary, . . . it must not have disparate outcomes as to major or\r\nminor parties.\"  Id.  In particular, CMP argues that primary\r\nelections have a \"disproportionate . . . impact [on small parties]\r\nin terms of raiding.\"  In other words, CMP argues that its small\r\nmembership could more easily be overcome by a determined group of\r\nraiders than could a larger, more established party, and that this\r\n\"disproportionate impact\" renders the primary requirement\r\nunconstitutional.  \r\nWhatever the merits of CMP's \"disparate impact\" argument\r\nmay be, the district court did not address it, and for good reason.\r\nThere is no indication in the record that CMP, in challenging R.I.\r\nGen. Laws   17-15-6 before the district court, ever raised its\r\nnovel \"disparate impact\" argument with even minimal clarity. \r\nAlthough the confused pleadings below suggest a highly generalized\r\nchallenge to Rhode Island's semi-closed primary system, and\r\nalthough CMP's memorandum in support of its motion for summary\r\njudgment notes that the small size of the party makes it an easy\r\ntarget for raiders, there is certainly no coherent articulation of\r\nthe \"disparate impact\" rationale as a basis for invalidating the\r\nstatute. To the contrary, the pleadings below suggest that CMP's\r\nobjection to the primary requirement was based on First Amendment\r\nassociational rights (in particular, a party's right to decide for\r\nitself how its standard bearer will be chosen), not on equal\r\nprotection concerns.  CMP's general challenge was simply\r\ninsufficient to raise the \"disparate impact\" challenge in the\r\ndistrict court, and the fact that CMP's argument would have\r\nrequired factual development in the trial court makes application\r\nof the rule of forfeiture particularly appropriate here.  There are\r\nno extraordinary circumstances in this case that would cause us to\r\ndepart from the well-established appellate rule that arguments\r\nraised for the first time on appeal will not be considered.  See\r\nCampos-Orrego v. Rivera, 175 F.3d 89, 95 (1st Cir. 1999); Tele-\r\nCommunications, Inc. v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 104 F.3d 1229,\r\n1232-33 (10th Cir. 1997).  The district court's ruling on the\r\nmandatory primary requirement will stand. \r\nRhode Island's Semi-Closed Primary System \r\nThe State contends that the district court erred by\r\nconcluding that R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-24, which prohibits voters\r\nregistered in one party from voting in the primary of another\r\nparty, is unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibits such\r\nvoters from voting in the primary of another party whose bylaws\r\nwould permit their participation.  The district court, relying on\r\nSupreme Court authority it considered controlling, ruled that R.I.\r\nGen. Laws  17-15-24 unconstitutionally prevents CMP from inviting\r\nregistered voters from other parties to vote in the CMP primary. \r\nSee Cool Moose Party, 6 F. Supp.2d at 120-22.  On appeal, the State\r\nargues that the Supreme Court case on which the district court\r\nrelied, Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut, 479 U.S. 208\r\n(1986), is distinguishable and that the statute must be upheld in\r\nits entirety.  While we agree that Tashjian is not on all fours\r\nwith the case now before us, we nonetheless conclude that the State\r\nhas failed to offer adequate justifications for R.I. Gen. Laws\r\n17-15-24's infringement upon the associational rights of CMP.\r\nIn Tashjian, 479 U.S. 208, the Republican Party of the\r\nState of Connecticut and several of its officials challenged a\r\nConnecticut statute requiring voters in a party primary to be\r\nregistered members of that party, notwithstanding a Republican\r\nparty rule permitting independent voters to participate.  Using the\r\nbalancing framework applicable to challenges to election laws, the\r\nSupreme Court first observed that the \"freedom to join together in\r\nfurtherance of common political beliefs 'necessarily presupposes\r\nthe freedom to identify the people who constitute the\r\nassociation.'\" Id. at 214 (quoting Democratic Party of United\r\nStates v. Wisconsin ex. rel. LaFollette, 450 U.S. 107, 122 (1981)). \r\nBy hindering the party's attempts to broaden the base of public\r\nparticipation in and support for its activities, the statute\r\nburdened the party's association rights:\r\n  The statute here places limits upon the group\r\nof registered voters whom the Party may invite\r\nto participate in the \"basic function\" of\r\nselecting the Party's candidates.  The State\r\nthus limits the Party's associational\r\nopportunities at the crucial juncture at which\r\nthe appeal to common principles may be\r\ntranslated into concerted action, and hence\r\npolitical power in the community.\r\n\nId. at 215-16.         \r\nThe Court turned next to an examination of the four\r\ninterests that were asserted by the State to justify the statute's\r\ninfringement on the party's associational rights, among which was\r\nthe interest in \"protecting the integrity of the two-party system\r\nand the responsibility of party government.\"  Id. at 222.  Although\r\naccepting the proposition that the State may have an interest in\r\npreserving the integrity of the electoral process, the Court\r\nunequivocally rejected the notion that a State has any interest in\r\npaternalistically protecting a political party from its own\r\n(arguably) poor decisions concerning the boundaries of its\r\nassociation. Because the State \"'may not constitutionally\r\nsubstitute its own judgment for that of the Party,'\" id. at 224\r\n(quoting Democratic Party, 450 U.S. at 123-24), the Party was free\r\nto exercise its associational right to define its own boundaries by\r\ninviting independent voters to participate in its primary election,\r\neven if that decision was unwise, see id. at 225.\r\nThe Tashjian Court was careful to point out, however,\r\nthat its ruling was limited to the factual situation before it  \r\nnamely, a political party's desire to invite independent voters to\r\nparticipate in its primary:\r\n  Our holding today does not establish that\r\nstate regulation of primary voting\r\nqualifications may never withstand challenge\r\nby a political party or its membership.  A\r\nparty seeking, for example, to open its\r\nprimary to all voters, including members of\r\nother parties, would raise a different\r\ncombination of considerations.  Under such\r\ncircumstances, the effect of one party's\r\nbroadening of participation would threaten\r\nother parties with the disorganization effects\r\nwhich the statutes in [Storer] and [Rosario]\r\nwere designed to prevent.        \r\n\nId. at 224 n.13 (emphasis added).  The instant case presents\r\nexactly the hypothetical situation contemplated by the Tashjian\r\nfootnote: CMP wishes to invite Democrats, Republicans, and other\r\naffiliated voters to participate in its primary.  Tashjian does not\r\npurport to control such a situation, and in fact suggests that a\r\nstate may well be able to offer sufficiently weighty rationales in\r\nsupport of a statute prohibiting affiliated voters from\r\nparticipating in the primary of another party. \r\nAccordingly, the State is correct that the Tashjian case\r\ndoes not necessarily render unconstitutional R.I. Gen. Laws  17-\r\n15-24's prohibition on affiliated voters' participation in another\r\nparty's primary despite the consent of a party to that\r\nparticipation.  Indeed, Tashjian leaves the door open for the State\r\nto argue that R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-24 is necessary to prevent\r\ndistortions of the electoral process that affect not only CMP, but\r\nalso other parties or the party system generally. Curiously,\r\nhowever, the State failed to make such an argument in either the\r\ndistrict court or on appeal.\r\nIn defending  17-15-24 before the district court, the\r\nState apparently misunderstood the nature of CMP's challenge. \r\nBased on its memorandum in support of its motion for summary\r\njudgment, it appears that the State thought CMP was only\r\nchallenging the  length of time a voter must be disaffiliated from\r\nher former party before she may vote in another party's primary  \r\ni.e., ninety days. See R.I. Gen. Laws  17-9.1-24 (quoted supra\r\nnote 8).  The State missed CMP's actual, more fundamental claim\r\nthat a state cannot prevent a party from inviting voters to\r\nparticipate in its primary, irrespective of whether or when the\r\nvoters had disaffiliated from other parties. Given this\r\nmisapprehension of the nature of CMP's challenge, the State's\r\nmemorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment does not\r\nexplain the interests that the State relies upon to justify  17-\r\n15-24's infringement on CMP's associational right to define its own\r\nboundaries.  \r\nThe State does not do much better in its brief on appeal. \r\nAlthough it argues that this case is not controlled by Tashjian,\r\nand cites in particular footnote 13 from that opinion, see\r\nTashjian, 479 U.S. at 224, n.13 (reserving the question of whether\r\na party seeking to open its primary to affiliated voters would\r\nprevail), the State again fails to articulate with any clarity the\r\nstate interests that are served by  17-15-24's prohibition on a\r\npolitical party's ability to invite affiliated voters to\r\nparticipate in its primary.  In a few sentences at the end of its\r\nbrief, the State does contend that R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-24 is\r\nnecessary to confine voters to \"a single nominating act\"   i.e., to\r\nensure that voters do not vote in the primaries of more than one\r\nparty. \r\nAt oral argument, the State tried unsuccessfully to\r\narticulate the interests advanced by  17-15-24.  First, the State\r\nacknowledged that Rhode Island law makes it a crime to engage in\r\nmore than one nominating act, thus rendering the State's \"single\r\nnominating act\" rationale wholly unconvincing.  Next, the State\r\nargued that  17-15-24's prohibition on a political party's ability\r\nto invite affiliated voters to participate in its primary was\r\njustified by a concern for \"raiding.\"  We asked for clarification,\r\nprompting this exchange with the bench:\r\n  Q: What does party raiding mean in this\r\ncontext? . . .\r\n\n. . .\r\n\n  A: The concern . . . is that members of one\r\npolitical party seeking to disrupt the\r\ninternal workings of the other political party\r\nand to go in and affect the choice of the\r\nnominee of the party only for the purposes of\r\nchoosing let's say the weaker candidate will .\r\n. . really dissolve or weaken the votes of the\r\nactual members of the candidates [sic].  \r\n\n  Q: But [CMP is] saying don't be so\r\npaternalistic. Let us . . . decide who will\r\ncome in to vote and who we don't want to come\r\nin to vote.  That's our associational decision\r\nto make.\r\n\n  A: Right.  And the Supreme Court has said that\r\nthe states do have the ability to protect the\r\nparty from the internal workings of the party\r\nitself.  That was reiterated in Tashjian and\r\nthe most recent Timmons case.  \r\n\n  Q: I thought Tashjian was very much to the\r\ncontrary on that issue.\r\n\n  A: The basic right was reiterated.  But\r\nTimmons specifically addressed that and in\r\nfact stated the state has a compelling\r\ninterest in maintaining the distinct\r\nidentities of the party and in protecting the\r\nparty from the party itself.\r\n\nThrough this pointed exchange, it became clear that the State's\r\nambiguous raiding rationale is entirely paternalistic   i.e., the\r\nState justifies  17-15-24 by saying that the statute prevents a\r\nfoolhardy party from making unwise decisions concerning the\r\nboundaries of its association that might expose it to raiders.    \r\nContrary to the State's contentions at oral argument,\r\nhowever, the Supreme Court has been clear in its rejection of\r\npaternalistic justifications for infringements on a political\r\nparty's constitutional right to define the boundaries of its\r\nassociation.  See Tashjian, 479 U.S. at 224 (infringement on\r\npolitical party's associational rights cannot be defended on ground\r\nthat \"it protects the integrity of the Party from the Party\r\nitself\"); see also Eu, 489 U.S. at 227-28 (\"[E]ven if a ban on\r\nendorsements saves a political party from pursuing self-destructive\r\nacts, that would not justify a State substituting its judgment for\r\nthat of the party.\"); Timmons, 117 S. Ct. at 1374 (state's strong\r\ninterest in the stability of its political systems is not \"a\r\npaternalistic license for States to protect political parties from\r\nthe consequences of their own internal disagreements\").   Indeed,\r\nwhen raiding has been recognized as a valid justification for a\r\nstate election law, it has been in the context of voter challenges\r\nto election laws that inhibit registered voters' ability to invade\r\nanother party's primary without that party's consent.  See, e.g.,\r\nKusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. at 59-60; Rosario, 410 U.S. at 760. \r\nIn this case, although CMP wishes to invite voters affiliated with\r\nother parties to participate in its primary election, the State\r\nforbids the invitation without offering a plausible and\r\nconstitutionally permissible explanation for the prohibition.\r\nAlthough we do not require \"elaborate, empirical\r\nverification of the weightiness of the State's asserted\r\njustifications\" for such a prohibition, Timmons, 117 S. Ct. at 1372\r\n(citing Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, 195-96\r\n(1986)), the State must at least articulate plausible and\r\nconstitutionally legitimate justifications.  We will not invoke\r\njustifications out of whole cloth on the State's behalf.  See\r\nTimmons, 117 S. Ct. at 1379 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that\r\n\"[o]ur opinions have been explicit in their willingness to consider\r\nonly the particular interests put forward by a State to support\r\nlaws that impose any sort of burden on First Amendment rights\")\r\n(citing Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789, 817; Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434). \r\nGiven the State's failure to articulate any legitimate interest for\r\nthe restriction of  17-15-24 on the ability of a party to invite\r\nregistered voters from other parties to participate in its primary,\r\nwe must affirm the district court's ruling.    \r\nAffirmed.\n",

LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  In September 1996, the Cool Moose\r\nParty (\"CMP\"), a Rhode Island political party, and Robert J.\r\nHealey, Jr. individually and in his capacity as CMP's chairperson\r\n(referred to collectively herein as \"CMP\"), filed suit in federal\r\ndistrict court pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983 seeking declaratory and\r\ninjunctive relief from various provisions of Rhode Island's primary\r\nelection laws, R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-1 to 17-15-44.  After the\r\nparties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on a stipulated\r\nrecord, the district court ruled, inter alia, that R.I. Gen. Laws\r\n17-15-6, which requires political parties to select their\r\nnominees by means of primary election, is constitutional; and that\r\nR.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-24, which prohibits members of one political\r\nparty from voting in another party's primary, is unconstitutional\r\nto the extent that it prohibits such voters from participating in\r\na party primary when the bylaws of that party would permit such\r\nparticipation.  Both parties now appeal the adverse judgments\r\nagainst them.  We affirm.    \r\nThe Questions Presented\r\nWe note at the outset that CMP's challenges to Rhode\r\nIsland's primary election statutes both in the district court and\r\non appeal contain ambiguities which limit our ability to address\r\nits contentions and restrict the scope of our analysis.  As the\r\ndistrict court observed, CMP's pleadings and arguments \"are\r\ndifficult to decipher and do not clearly state the precise nature\r\nof the constitutional violations alleged.\" Cool Moose Party v.\r\nRhode Island, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2347646\"><a href=\"/opinion/2347646/cool-moose-party-v-state-of-ri/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Gen. Laws  17-15-6, which\r\nrequires political parties to select their\r\nnominees by means of primary elections,\r\nviolates CMP members' right to freedom of\r\nassociation by preventing them from selecting\r\ncandidates at a caucus open only to CMP\r\nmembers.\r\n\n  (2) Whether R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-24, which\r\nprohibits members of one political party from\r\nvoting in another party's primary, violates\r\nthe plaintiffs' right to freedom of\r\nassociation because it prevents CMP from\r\nallowing members of other parties to\r\nparticipate in the selection of CMP\r\ncandidates.\r\n\nId.

Ct. at 1370 (internal quotation marks and citations\r\nomitted); see also Werme v.

Under this formulation, \"no bright line separates\r\npermissible election-related regulation from unconstitutional\r\ninfringements on First Amendment freedoms.\"  Timmons, 117 S. Ct. at\r\n1370.   \r\nThe Primary Requirement\r\nCMP contends that R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-6, which\r\nrequires that parties select their nominees by primary election\r\nrather than by party convention or caucus, is unconstitutional.\r\nAlthough we have considerable difficulty deciphering CMP's\r\nargument, CMP on appeal appears to accept the proposition that\r\nstates may require parties to select their nominees by primary\r\nelection without violating the parties' First Amendment\r\nassociational rights.  See, e.g., Reply Br. at 6.  Rather, CMP now\r\nmakes a vague equal protection challenge to the primary\r\nrequirement, contending that although Rhode Island \"may mandate a\r\nprimary, . . . it must not have disparate outcomes as to major or\r\nminor parties.\"  Id.  In particular, CMP argues that primary\r\nelections have a \"disproportionate . . . impact [on small parties]\r\nin terms of raiding.\"  In other words, CMP argues that its small\r\nmembership could more easily be overcome by a determined group of\r\nraiders than could a larger, more established party, and that this\r\n\"disproportionate impact\" renders the primary requirement\r\nunconstitutional.  \r\nWhatever the merits of CMP's \"disparate impact\" argument\r\nmay be, the district court did not address it, and for good reason.\r\nThere is no indication in the record that CMP, in challenging R.I.\r\nGen. Laws   17-15-6 before the district court, ever raised its\r\nnovel \"disparate impact\" argument with even minimal clarity. \r\nAlthough the confused pleadings below suggest a highly generalized\r\nchallenge to Rhode Island's semi-closed primary system, and\r\nalthough CMP's memorandum in support of its motion for summary\r\njudgment notes that the small size of the party makes it an easy\r\ntarget for raiders, there is certainly no coherent articulation of\r\nthe \"disparate impact\" rationale as a basis for invalidating the\r\nstatute. To the contrary, the pleadings below suggest that CMP's\r\nobjection to the primary requirement was based on First Amendment\r\nassociational rights (in particular, a party's right to decide for\r\nitself how its standard bearer will be chosen), not on equal\r\nprotection concerns.  CMP's general challenge was simply\r\ninsufficient to raise the \"disparate impact\" challenge in the\r\ndistrict court, and the fact that CMP's argument would have\r\nrequired factual development in the trial court makes application\r\nof the rule of forfeiture particularly appropriate here.  There are\r\nno extraordinary circumstances in this case that would cause us to\r\ndepart from the well-established appellate rule that arguments\r\nraised for the first time on appeal will not be considered.

The district court's ruling on the\r\nmandatory primary requirement will stand. \r\nRhode Island's Semi-Closed Primary System \r\nThe State contends that the district court erred by\r\nconcluding that R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-24, which prohibits voters\r\nregistered in one party from voting in the primary of another\r\nparty, is unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibits such\r\nvoters from voting in the primary of another party whose bylaws\r\nwould permit their participation.  The district court, relying on\r\nSupreme Court authority it considered controlling, ruled that R.I.\r\nGen.

On appeal, the State\r\nargues that the Supreme Court case on which the district court\r\nrelied, Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111781\"><a href=\"/opinion/111781/tashjian-v-republican-party-of-conn/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(1986), is distinguishable and that the statute must be upheld in\r\nits entirety.  While we agree that Tashjian is not on all fours\r\nwith the case now before us, we nonetheless conclude that the State\r\nhas failed to offer adequate justifications for R.I. Gen. Laws\r\n17-15-24's infringement upon the associational rights of CMP.\r\nIn Tashjian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111781\"><a href=\"/opinion/111781/tashjian-v-republican-party-of-conn/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Republican Party of the\r\nState of Connecticut and several of its officials challenged a\r\nConnecticut statute requiring voters in a party primary to be\r\nregistered members of that party, notwithstanding a Republican\r\nparty rule permitting independent voters to participate.  Using the\r\nbalancing framework applicable to challenges to election laws, the\r\nSupreme Court first observed that the \"freedom to join together in\r\nfurtherance of common political beliefs 'necessarily presupposes\r\nthe freedom to identify the people who constitute the\r\nassociation.'\" Id. at 214 (quoting Democratic Party of United\r\nStates v. Wisconsin ex. rel. LaFollette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110418\"><a href=\"/opinion/110418/democratic-party-of-united-states-v-wisconsin-ex-rel-la-follette/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 122 (1981)). \r\nBy hindering the party's attempts to broaden the base of public\r\nparticipation in and support for its activities, the statute\r\nburdened the party's association rights:\r\n  The statute here places limits upon the group\r\nof registered voters whom the Party may invite\r\nto participate in the \"basic function\" of\r\nselecting the Party's candidates.  The State\r\nthus limits the Party's associational\r\nopportunities at the crucial juncture at which\r\nthe appeal to common principles may be\r\ntranslated into concerted action, and hence\r\npolitical power in the community.\r\n\nId. at 215-16.         \r\nThe Court turned next to an examination of the four\r\ninterests that were asserted by the State to justify the statute's\r\ninfringement on the party's associational rights, among which was\r\nthe interest in \"protecting the integrity of the two-party system\r\nand the responsibility of party government.\"  Id. at 222.  Although\r\naccepting the proposition that the State may have an interest in\r\npreserving the integrity of the electoral process, the Court\r\nunequivocally rejected the notion that a State has any interest in\r\npaternalistically protecting a political party from its own\r\n(arguably) poor decisions concerning the boundaries of its\r\nassociation. Because the State \"'may not constitutionally\r\nsubstitute its own judgment for that of the Party,'\" id. at 224\r\n(quoting Democratic Party, 450 U.S. at 123-24), the Party was free\r\nto exercise its associational right to define its own boundaries by\r\ninviting independent voters to participate in its primary election,\r\neven if that decision was unwise, see id. at 225.\r\nThe Tashjian Court was careful to point out, however,\r\nthat its ruling was limited to the factual situation before it  \r\nnamely, a political party's desire to invite independent voters to\r\nparticipate in its primary:\r\n  Our holding today does not establish that\r\nstate regulation of primary voting\r\nqualifications may never withstand challenge\r\nby a political party or its membership.  A\r\nparty seeking, for example, to open its\r\nprimary to all voters, including members of\r\nother parties, would raise a different\r\ncombination of considerations.  Under such\r\ncircumstances, the effect of one party's\r\nbroadening of participation would threaten\r\nother parties with the disorganization effects\r\nwhich the statutes in [Storer] and [Rosario]\r\nwere designed to prevent.        \r\n\nId. at 224 n.13 (emphasis added).  The instant case presents\r\nexactly the hypothetical situation contemplated by the Tashjian\r\nfootnote: CMP wishes to invite Democrats, Republicans, and other\r\naffiliated voters to participate in its primary.  Tashjian does not\r\npurport to control such a situation, and in fact suggests that a\r\nstate may well be able to offer sufficiently weighty rationales in\r\nsupport of a statute prohibiting affiliated voters from\r\nparticipating in the primary of another party. \r\nAccordingly, the State is correct that the Tashjian case\r\ndoes not necessarily render unconstitutional R.I. Gen. Laws  17-\r\n15-24's prohibition on affiliated voters' participation in another\r\nparty's primary despite the consent of a party to that\r\nparticipation.  Indeed, Tashjian leaves the door open for the State\r\nto argue that R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-24 is necessary to prevent\r\ndistortions of the electoral process that affect not only CMP, but\r\nalso other parties or the party system generally. Curiously,\r\nhowever, the State failed to make such an argument in either the\r\ndistrict court or on appeal.\r\nIn defending  17-15-24 before the district court, the\r\nState apparently misunderstood the nature of CMP's challenge. \r\nBased on its memorandum in support of its motion for summary\r\njudgment, it appears that the State thought CMP was only\r\nchallenging the  length of time a voter must be disaffiliated from\r\nher former party before she may vote in another party's primary  \r\ni.e., ninety days. See R.I. Gen. Laws  17-9.1-24 (quoted supra\r\nnote 8).  The State missed CMP's actual, more fundamental claim\r\nthat a state cannot prevent a party from inviting voters to\r\nparticipate in its primary, irrespective of whether or when the\r\nvoters had disaffiliated from other parties. Given this\r\nmisapprehension of the nature of CMP's challenge, the State's\r\nmemorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment does not\r\nexplain the interests that the State relies upon to justify  17-\r\n15-24's infringement on CMP's associational right to define its own\r\nboundaries.  \r\nThe State does not do much better in its brief on appeal. \r\nAlthough it argues that this case is not controlled by Tashjian,\r\nand cites in particular footnote 13 from that opinion, see\r\nTashjian, 479 U.S. at 224, n.13 (reserving the question of whether\r\na party seeking to open its primary to affiliated voters would\r\nprevail), the State again fails to articulate with any clarity the\r\nstate interests that are served by  17-15-24's prohibition on a\r\npolitical party's ability to invite affiliated voters to\r\nparticipate in its primary.  In a few sentences at the end of its\r\nbrief, the State does contend that R.I. Gen. Laws  17-15-24 is\r\nnecessary to confine voters to \"a single nominating act\"   i.e., to\r\nensure that voters do not vote in the primaries of more than one\r\nparty. \r\nAt oral argument, the State tried unsuccessfully to\r\narticulate the interests advanced by  17-15-24.  First, the State\r\nacknowledged that Rhode Island law makes it a crime to engage in\r\nmore than one nominating act, thus rendering the State's \"single\r\nnominating act\" rationale wholly unconvincing.  Next, the State\r\nargued that  17-15-24's prohibition on a political party's ability\r\nto invite affiliated voters to participate in its primary was\r\njustified by a concern for \"raiding.\"  We asked for clarification,\r\nprompting this exchange with the bench:\r\n  Q: What does party raiding mean in this\r\ncontext? . . .\r\n\n. . .\r\n\n  A: The concern . . . is that members of one\r\npolitical party seeking to disrupt the\r\ninternal workings of the other political party\r\nand to go in and affect the choice of the\r\nnominee of the party only for the purposes of\r\nchoosing let's say the weaker candidate will .\r\n. . really dissolve or weaken the votes of the\r\nactual members of the candidates [sic].  \r\n\n  Q: But [CMP is] saying don't be so\r\npaternalistic. Let us . . . decide who will\r\ncome in to vote and who we don't want to come\r\nin to vote.  That's our associational decision\r\nto make.\r\n\n  A: Right.  And the Supreme Court has said that\r\nthe states do have the ability to protect the\r\nparty from the internal workings of the party\r\nitself.  That was reiterated in Tashjian and\r\nthe most recent Timmons case.  \r\n\n  Q: I thought Tashjian was very much to the\r\ncontrary on that issue.\r\n\n  A: The basic right was reiterated.  But\r\nTimmons specifically addressed that and in\r\nfact stated the state has a compelling\r\ninterest in maintaining the distinct\r\nidentities of the party and in protecting the\r\nparty from the party itself.\r\n\nThrough this pointed exchange, it became clear that the State's\r\nambiguous raiding rationale is entirely paternalistic   i.e., the\r\nState justifies  17-15-24 by saying that the statute prevents a\r\nfoolhardy party from making unwise decisions concerning the\r\nboundaries of its association that might expose it to raiders.    \r\nContrary to the State's contentions at oral argument,\r\nhowever, the Supreme Court has been clear in its rejection of\r\npaternalistic justifications for infringements on a political\r\nparty's constitutional right to define the boundaries of its\r\nassociation.  See Tashjian, 479 U.S. at 224 (infringement on\r\npolitical party's associational rights cannot be defended on ground\r\nthat \"it protects the integrity of the Party from the Party\r\nitself\"); see also Eu, 489 U.S. at 227-28 (\"[E]ven if a ban on\r\nendorsements saves a political party from pursuing self-destructive\r\nacts, that would not justify a State substituting its judgment for\r\nthat of the party.\"); Timmons, 117 S. Ct. at 1374 (state's strong\r\ninterest in the stability of its political systems is not \"a\r\npaternalistic license for States to protect political parties from\r\nthe consequences of their own internal disagreements\").   Indeed,\r\nwhen raiding has been recognized as a valid justification for a\r\nstate election law, it has been in the context of voter challenges\r\nto election laws that inhibit registered voters' ability to invade\r\nanother party's primary without that party's consent.  See, e.g.,\r\nKusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. at 59-60; Rosario, 410 U.S. at 760. \r\nIn this case, although CMP wishes to invite voters affiliated with\r\nother parties to participate in its primary election, the State\r\nforbids the invitation without offering a plausible and\r\nconstitutionally permissible explanation for the prohibition.\r\nAlthough we do not require \"elaborate, empirical\r\nverification of the weightiness of the State's asserted\r\njustifications\" for such a prohibition, Timmons, 117 S. Ct. at 1372\r\n(citing Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111780\"><a href=\"/opinion/111780/munro-v-socialist-workers-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195-96\r\n(1986)), the State must at least articulate plausible and\r\nconstitutionally legitimate justifications.
