Defendant Jocelyn  Antonio\r                                             \r\n\nMendez-de  Jesus entered  a  conditional plea  of  guilty to  re-\r\n\nentering  the United States after being  deported subsequent to a\r\n\nfelony conviction,  8 U.S.C.    1326(a)  &amp; (b)(1), reserving  his\r\n\nright  to appeal  the district  court's denial  of his  motion to\r\n\nsuppress his  identification and immigration record.   Finding no\r\n\nerror below, we affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r\n\n     Three  boats  carrying  illegal aliens  from  the  Dominican\r\n\nRepublic landed in  the vicinity  of Rincon, Puerto  Rico in  the\r\n\nlate hours of December  12 and early hours of December  13, 1994.\r\n\nOn the morning of  December 13, two private citizens  brought the\r\n\ndefendant  and an unknown female to the police station in Rincon.\r\n\nBorder  Patrol   Agent  Hector   Lugo  of  the   Immigration  and\r\n\nNaturalization  Service  (INS)  was  there already  in  order  to\r\n\ninterview persons  who had been  picked up  from the boats.   The\r\n\ncitizens  reported to Lugo  that the defendant  and his companion\r\n\nwere not known to them and appeared to be lost.\r\n\n     Lugo  suspected that  the  female passenger  was an  illegal\r\n\nalien:  she had damp and dirty clothing, ragged hair, and an odor\r\n\nassociated  with urine and defecation  on boats.   Mendez, on the\r\n\nother hand,  did  not  give the  impression  of  having  recently\r\n\narrived   illegally  via   boat.     He  appeared   tidy,  denied\r\n\nunderstanding Spanish and told  Lugo that \"I'm from here.\"   Lugo\r\n\ncommenced  questioning  the  woman,  who,  instead of  answering,\r\n\ncontinually  looked at Mendez.  Lugo asked if she knew Mendez and\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nshe responded  affirmatively.   Mendez also  acknowledged knowing\r\n\nthe  woman,  saying that  they  met  in the  Dominican  Republic.\r\n\nEventually,  the  woman admitted  that  she  entered Puerto  Rico\r\n\nillegally that morning.  \r\n\n     At that time, Lugo asked  Mendez for identification and  was\r\n\ngiven his  resident alien registration  card.  He  brought Mendez\r\n\ninside  the  station  and,  while awaiting  verification  of  the\r\n\nregistration card, began interrogating  him.  Shortly thereafter,\r\n\nhe received information that Mendez had previously been deported.\r\n\n     The district court denied  Mendez's motion to suppress, but,\r\n\non  his  motion  for  reconsideration,  found  that  Lugo  lacked\r\n\nprobable  cause to  further  detain or  interrogate Mendez  after\r\n\nreceiving his  alien registration card and, therefore, suppressed\r\n\nall statements  made thereafter.   The court refused  to suppress\r\n\nthe card itself or the corresponding  INS records that documented\r\n\nhis previous deportation.   \r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r\n\nA.   Standard of Review \r                                 \r\n\n     Our review of a district court's decision to grant or deny a\r\n\nsuppression motion  is plenary.   United States  v. McCarthy,  77\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir. 1996).  We scrutinize the court's factual\r\n\nfindings, including credibility determinations, for  clear error,\r\n\nUnited States v.  Valle, 72  F.3d 210, 214  (1st Cir. 1995),  and\r                                 \r\n\nwill  uphold a denial  of a motion to  suppress if any reasonable\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nview  of the evidence  supports it.   United States v.  de Jesus-\r                                                                           \r\n\nRios, 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir. 1993).  \r              \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nB.   Fourth Amendment Claims\r                                      \r\n\n     In an effort  to invoke the exclusionary  rule, Lugo alleges\r\n\ntwo  violations of the Fourth Amendment.  First, he contends that\r\n\nhe  was illegally  arrested and  brought to  the  police station.\r\n\nSecond,  he argues  that  Lugo's request  for his  identification\r\n\nconstituted an unconstitutional seizure.\r\n\n     We  can  quickly dispose  of the  first  issue.   Mendez was\r\n\nbrought to the police station by two private citizens.  While the\r\n\nseizure of Mendez may  have assisted the government, there  is no\r\n\nsuggestion that  the government initiated or  participated in the\r\n\ncitizen  action.   In  the absence  of  governmental action,  the\r\n\nFourth  Amendment does not apply.   See Skinner  v. Railway Labor\r                                                                           \r\n\nExecutives'  Ass'n, 489  U.S. 602,  614 (1989)  (Fourth Amendment\r                            \r\n\ndoes not apply to  private action unless private party  \"acted as\r\n\nan instrument  or agent  of the  Government\");  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nJacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113 (1984).\r                  \r\n\n     Mendez's alternative claim fares no better.  He contests the\r\n\ncourt's finding  that Lugo's authority to  ask for identification\r\n\nderived  from 8  U.S.C.     1357(a)(1),  which provides  that  an\r\n\nimmigration  officer may, without warrant, \"interrogate any alien\r\n\nor person believed to  be an alien  as to his right  to be or  to\r\n\nremain in the United States.\"  In support, he cites the principle\r\n\nthat an  individual  may not  be detained  for questioning  about\r\n\ncitizenship  absent reasonable  suspicion that  the person  is an\r\n\nillegal alien, see United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873,\r                                                            \r\n\n884  (1975), and  points  to Lugo's  testimony  that he  had  the\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nimpression that Mendez was  a United States citizen.   While this\r\n\nparticular argument concerning the  applicability of   1357(a)(1)\r\n\nis not  without force, it  is ultimately  unavailing because  the\r\n\ncourt's findings  clearly  demonstrate that  Lugo had  reasonable\r\n\nsuspicion that Mendez was violating the immigration laws.\r\n\n     It is well settled that, based on reasonable and articulable\r\n\nsuspicion, an  officer may  make a  brief stop or  seizure of  an\r\n\nindividual  to investigate  suspected  past  or present  criminal\r\n\nactivity.    McCarthy, 77  F.3d at  529.1   The  determination of\r                               \r\n\nwhether  an  officer  acted  reasonably requires  two  subsidiary\r\n\ninquiries:   1) whether the officer's action was justified at its\r\n\ninception; and 2) whether the action taken was reasonably related\r\n\nin scope to  the circumstances justifying the interference in the\r\n\nfirst place.  Id. at 530 (citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19-20\r                                                        \r\n\n(1968)).    This  determination   demands  examination  into  the\r\n\ntotality of the circumstances confronting the officer at the time\r\n\nof the stop.  Id.\r                           \r\n\n     Lugo testified that, at the time of his request for Mendez's\r\n\nidentification, he was aware that 1) three boats carrying illegal\r\n\naliens had  arrived in the area within  the previous 24 hours; 2)\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1  In INS  v. Delgado, the Court stated  that \"interrogation\r                                    \r\nrelating to one's identity or a request for identification by the\r\npolice  does  not,  by  itself,  constitute  a  Fourth  Amendment\r\nseizure.\"  466  U.S. 210, 216 (1984).   The Court added, however,\r\nthat such an encounter  may constitute a detention or  seizure if\r\n\"the  circumstances . . .  are so intimidating  as to demonstrate\r\nthat a reasonable  person would have believed he was  not free to\r\nleave if he had not responded.\"  Id.  Though perhaps unnecessary,\r                                              \r\nfor  purposes of this case  we will assume  without deciding that\r\nthe  circumstances surrounding Lugo's  request for identification\r\nconstituted a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.  \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nMendez and a woman  had been brought  to the station by  citizens\r\n\nwho reported that the  couple looked lost and unfamiliar;  3) the\r\n\nwoman appeared to be an illegal alien, though  Mendez did not; 4)\r\n\nwhen  asked questions the woman looked to Mendez for guidance; 5)\r\n\nMendez  and the  woman admitted  knowing each  other; and  6) the\r\n\nwoman  admitted to  being  an illegal  alien.2   Lugo  maintained\r\n\nthat, based on these  circumstances, he believed that  Mendez was\r\n\nassisting the woman in violation of the immigration laws.\r\n\n     The  court  credited  this  testimony  and  determined  that\r\n\n\"[t]hese  discoveries  and   observations  further  supported   a\r\n\nreasonable  suspicion of  alienage  and formed  the  basis for  a\r\n\nsuspicion  of illegal assistance.\"   We agree.   In this context,\r\n\nLugo's request  for identification  was a reasonable  and minimal\r\n\nintrusion directly related to his suspicions, and did not violate\r\n\nthe  Fourth Amendment.    As such,  the  district court  properly\r\n\ndenied  Mendez's  motion  to   suppress  his  identification  and\r\n\nimmigration record.3\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2  Mendez lodged hearsay objections to Lugo's account of the\r\nwoman  looking at  Mendez and  her statement  that she  knew him,\r\nwhich were  properly overruled.   The look was  nonverbal conduct\r\nnot intended as  an assertion,  and both the  look and  statement\r\nwere  offered  for their  effect on  Lugo's understanding  of the\r\nunfolding  events -- i.e., his reasonable suspicion -- and not to\r\nprove that  the woman and  Mendez actually  knew each other.   As\r\nsuch, his  account was not hearsay.   See Fed. R.  Evid. 801(a) &amp;\r                                                   \r\n(c).\r\n\n     3   The district court alternatively found that, even in the\r\nface of a Fourth Amendment violation, the \"body\" or identity of a\r\ndefendant is never  suppressible.  See INS  v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468\r                                                                      \r\nU.S. 1032, 1039  (1984); United States  v. Orozco-Rico, 589  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n433, 435 (9th  Cir. 1978).   Because we find no  Fourth Amendment\r\nviolation, at least up  to the point that Lugo  received Mendez's\r\nalien registration card, we need not address this conclusion.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                        \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n",

On the morning of December 13, two private citizens brought the defendant and an unknown female to the police station in Rincon.   Border Patrol Agent Hector Lugo of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was there already in order to interview persons who had been picked up from the boats.

Finding no error below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three boats carrying illegal aliens from the Dominican Republic landed in the vicinity of Rincon, Puerto Rico in the late hours of December 12 and early hours of December 13, 1994.   On the morning of December 13, two private citizens brought the defendant and an unknown female to the police station in Rincon.   Border Patrol Agent Hector Lugo of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was there already in order to interview persons who had been picked up from the boats.   The citizens reported to Lugo that the defendant and his companion were not known to them and appeared to be lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo suspected that the female passenger was an illegal alien:  she had damp and dirty clothing, ragged hair, and an odor associated with urine and defecation on boats.   Mendez, on the other hand, did not give the impression of having recently arrived illegally via boat.   He appeared tidy, denied understanding Spanish and told Lugo that \"I'm from here.\"   Lugo commenced questioning the woman, who, instead of answering, continually looked at Mendez.   Lugo asked if she knew Mendez and she responded affirmatively.   Mendez also acknowledged knowing the woman, saying that they met in the Dominican Republic.   Eventually, the woman admitted that she entered Puerto Rico illegally that morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that time, Lugo asked Mendez for identification and was given his resident alien registration card.   He brought Mendez inside the station and, while awaiting verification of the registration card, began interrogating him.   Shortly thereafter, he received information that Mendez had previously been deported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Mendez's motion to suppress, but, on his motion for reconsideration, found that Lugo lacked probable cause to further detain or interrogate Mendez after receiving his alien registration card and, therefore, suppressed all statements made thereafter.   The court refused to suppress the card itself or the corresponding INS records that documented his previous deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a district court's decision to grant or deny a suppression motion is plenary.

We scrutinize the court's factual findings, including credibility determinations, for clear error, United States v. Valle, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196494\"><a href=\"/opinion/196494/united-states-v-valle/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 214 (1st Cir.1995), and will uphold a denial of a motion to suppress if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it.  United States v. de Jesus-Rios, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604123\"><a href=\"/opinion/604123/united-states-v-jose-de-jesus-rios-aka-papo-rios-united-states-v-eva/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span>, 677 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Fourth Amendment Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to invoke the exclusionary rule, Lugo alleges two violations of the Fourth Amendment.   First, he contends that he was illegally arrested and brought to the police station.   Second, he argues that Lugo's request for his identification constituted an unconstitutional seizure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can quickly dispose of the first issue.   Mendez was brought to the police station by two private citizens.   While the seizure of Mendez may have assisted the government, there is no suggestion that the government initiated or participated in the citizen action.   In the absence of governmental action, the Fourth Amendment does not apply.   See Skinner v.
