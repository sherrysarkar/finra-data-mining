This  case,  presenting   a\r                                        \r\n\ndifficult  preemption  issue,  began  in  January  1996  when\r\n\nTheresa   Martin   sued   Shaw's   Supermarkets,   Inc.,   in\r\n\nMassachusetts state  court for  alleged  violations of  state\r\n\nemployment-compensation laws.   Martin, an employee of Shaw's\r\n\nsince 1979, had injured her back in August 1994 while working\r\n\nas  a bakery clerk.   In September 1994,  she began receiving\r\n\nworkers'   compensation   benefits   for    temporary   total\r\n\ndisability.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152,   34.\r\n\n     In March 1995, Shaw's requested that Martin's physician,\r\n\nDr.  James Coleman, establish any necessary work restrictions\r\n\nfor  Martin.    Coleman  gave   Shaw's  a  list  of  physical\r\n\nrestrictions and  indicated that Martin could  return to work\r\n\nif  these restrictions  were  respected.   Shaw's then  asked\r\n\nMartin  to  see  a  second  doctor.    Based  on  the  second\r\n\nexamination, Shaw's  offered  Martin four  weeks of  modified\r\n\nduty, to be followed by return to her former position without\r\n\nrestrictions.\r\n\n     Martin did not  return to  work.   Instead, through  her\r\n\nattorney,  she  again  asked   for  a  position  fitting  the\r\n\nrestrictions  set  by Coleman.    Shaw's  responded by  again\r\n\noffering  Martin  her former  position with  no restrictions.\r\n\nWhen  discussion failed  to resolve  the matter,  Shaw's sent\r\n\nMartin  a letter in September 1995 informing her that she was\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nterminated.    The  letter  referred to  Shaw's  \"policy  and\r\n\ncontract language concerning extended periods of absence.\"\r\n\n     On  October 19,  1995,  Martin reapplied  for  full-time\r\n\nemployment with  Shaw's, requesting  a  position with  duties\r\n\nmodified as Coleman had recommended.  Shaw's did not respond.\r\n\nLater in the month,  Martin's union filed a grievance  on her\r\n\nbehalf under its collective bargaining agreement with Shaw's,\r\n\nalleging  that  Martin  had  been   unjustly  terminated  and\r\n\nrequesting her reinstatement with reasonable accommodations.\r\n\n     Three months  later, Martin filed the  present action in\r\n\nMassachusetts  state court, claiming that Shaw's had violated\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 152,    75A, 75B(2), by failing to rehire\r\n\nher.  These sections  provide, respectively, that an employee\r\n\nwho lost  her job as a  result of compensable injury  must be\r\n\ngiven rehiring  preference by  the former employer  over non-\r\n\nemployee  applicants, id.    75A,  and that  no employer  may\r                                     \r\n\nrefuse  to hire an  employee because she  asserted a workers'\r\n\ncompensation  claim, id.    75B(2).   Martin's  suit did  not\r                                    \r\n\ncontest Shaw's right to discharge her  in the first instance.\r\n\n     In  March 1996,  Shaw's  removed the  action to  federal\r\n\ncourt,  premising jurisdiction  under 28  U.S.C.   1331,  and\r\n\nmoved to dismiss,  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 12(b)(6).   The  district\r\n\ncourt  granted Shaw's motion,  agreeing that  Martin's claims\r\n\nwere  preempted  by  section  301  of  the  Labor  Management\r\n\nRelations  Act, 29  U.S.C.   185.   Martin  now  appeals this\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nruling.   The  sole issue  on appeal  is whether  section 301\r\n\npreempts Martin's state-law claims.1 \r\n\n     Section  301 modestly  provides  only that  \"[s]uits for\r\n\nviolation  of  contracts  between  an employer  and  a  labor\r\n\norganization representing employees  . . . may  be brought in\r\n\nany district  court of the United  States having jurisdiction\r\n\nof the  parties . . . .\"   29 U.S.C.   185.  But jurisdiction\r\n\nbegat substantive  authority.  In Textile  Workers v. Lincoln\r                                                                         \r\n\nMills, 353 U.S. 448, 451 (1957), the Supreme Court ruled that\r                 \r\n\nthis section \"authorizes federal courts to  fashion a body of\r\n\nfederal   law  for  the  enforcement  of  .  .  .  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreements.\"\r\n\n     In turn, substantive authority  gave rise to preemption.\r\n\nIn Teamsters v. Lucas Flour Co., 369 U.S. 95, 103 (1962), the\r                                           \r\n\nSupreme Court  held that state  law is displaced  when courts\r\n\nare   \"called  upon   to   enforce\"   collective   bargaining\r\n\nagreements, because  those agreements should  be governed  by\r\n\nfederal  doctrine,  rather  than varying  state  contract-law\r\n\nprinciples.  Then, two decades later,  the Supreme Court said\r\n\nthat  \"the pre-emptive  effect of     301 must  extend beyond\r\n\n[state-law]  suits  alleging  contract violations.\"    Allis-\r                                                                         \r\n\nChalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S. 202, 210 (1985).\r                                   \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1The   asserted   jurisdictional  basis   for  removal--\r\npreemption--might appear to offend the well-pleaded complaint\r\nrule,  but where  section  301 preemption  is concerned,  the\r\nSupreme Court has  held that removal is proper.   Caterpillar\r                                                                         \r\nInc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 393-94 (1987).\r                            \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     Just how  far beyond  has never been  precisely settled.\r\n\nAllis-Chalmers  preempted  a  state-law  tort  claim  closely\r                          \r\n\nrelating  to the  handling  of a  labor-agreement  grievance.\r\n\nShortly thereafter the Court declared that state-law claims--\r\n\nseemingly  of  whatever  character--are  preempted   if  they\r\n\n\"require  construing  the  collective-bargaining  agreement.\"\r\n\nLingle v. Norge  Div. of Magic Chef, Inc.,  486 U.S. 399, 407\r                                                     \r\n\n(1988).    Yet recently,  the  Supreme  Court cautioned  that\r\n\nsection 301 \"cannot be read broadly to pre-empt nonnegotiable\r\n\nrights conferred on individual employees as a matter of state\r\n\nlaw.\"  Livadas v. Bradshaw, 114 S. Ct. 2068, 2078 (1994).\r                                      \r\n\n     Nevertheless, Livadas  repeated the basic test laid down\r                                      \r\n\nby  Lingle--namely, that  section  301  preempts a  state-law\r                      \r\n\nclaim wherever a  court, in passing upon  the asserted state-\r\n\nlaw  claim,  would  be  required  to  interpret  a  plausibly\r\n\ndisputed  provision of  the collective  bargaining agreement.\r\n\nId.  At first blush,  this might seem a puzzling test:   both\r               \r\n\nstate and federal courts have authority to enforce collective\r\n\nbargaining agreements,  and so to interpret their provisions.\r\n\nSee  Charles  Dowd Box  Co. v.  Courtney,  368 U.S.  502, 506\r                                                    \r\n\n(1962).\r\n\n     The explanation  lies in the Supreme  Court's concern to\r\n\nenforce arbitration clauses, almost always a feature of labor\r\n\ncontracts.  If judges construed labor agreements in the first\r\n\ninstance, the  Court believed  that  the arbitration  process\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nwould be undermined, and there might be divergent readings of\r\n\nthe  labor  agreement  and  interference  with the  grievance\r\n\nprocess itself.  Livadas, 114 S. Ct. at 2078; Allis-Chalmers,\r                                                                        \r\n\n471 U.S. at  219.  Such  an arbitration clause is  present in\r                              \r\n\nthis case.\r\n\n     We thus begin  by asking, as we  have done in the  past,\r\n\ne.g., Quesnel v. Prudential  Ins. Co., 66 F.3d 8,  10-11 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.  1995),  whether  resolution  of Martin's  claims  would\r\n\nrequire  an  interpretation   of  the  collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement.    Our   premise  is  that   this  means  a   real\r                                                                         \r\n\ninterpretive  dispute  and not  merely  a pretended  dispute.\r\n\nIndeed,  the Supreme Court has  said that the  need merely to\r\n\nrefer  in  passing  to  the agreement  will  not  necessarily\r\n\npreempt.  Livadas, 114 S. Ct. at 2078.\r                             \r\n\n     Martin  has alleged  violations of  Mass. Gen.  Laws ch.\r\n\n152,     75A, 75B(2).   Section  75A creates  a  priority for\r\n\nrehiring:\r\n\n     Any  person who has  lost a job  as a result  of an\r\n     injury  compensable  under  this  chapter  shall be\r\n     given preference in hiring by the employer for whom\r\n     he worked  at the  time of compensable  injury over\r\n     any  persons not  at  the time  of application  for\r\n     reemployment employed by  such employer;  provided,\r\n     however, that a suitable job is available.\r\n\nThe   relevant  portion  of  section  75B(2)--a  conventional\r\n\nprohibition against retaliation--states that \"[n]o employer .\r\n\n.  . shall  . .  .  refuse to  hire  or in  any other  manner\r\n\ndiscriminate against  an employee  because  the employee  has\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nexercised  a  right afforded  by this  [workers compensation]\r\n\nchapter.\"  \r\n\n     If the statutes stopped here,  this might be a different\r\n\ncase.   But  both statutory sections  also contain  a proviso\r\n\nthat \"[i]n the event any right  set forth in this section  is\r\n\ninconsistent   with   an  applicable   collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement,\" the agreement shall prevail.  Id.    75A, 75B(3).\r                                                         \r\n\nShaw's  argues that  both  of Martin's  statutory claims  are\r\n\ninconsistent with  the  labor agreement;  that resolution  of\r\n\nthis  \"inconsistency\" charge  requires interpretation  of the\r\n\nagreement; and that the  claims are therefore preempted under\r\n\nthe Supreme Court's own rubric.\r\n\n     It is  very doubtful  whether, without  this last-quoted\r\n\nproviso,  Shaw's would  have any  plausible claim  of federal\r\n\npreemption.    Massachusetts has  an independent  interest in\r\n\nregulating  injury compensation; and  apart from the proviso,\r\n\nthe elements of both Martin's  state-law claims appear to  be\r\n\nindependent  of bargaining  agreement provisions.   There are\r\n\nother types of labor preemption, apart from Lingle's \"require\r                                                              \r\n\nconstruing\" test,2  but Shaw's  does not argue  that Martin's\r\n\nstate claims would be preempted absent the proviso.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Broadly speaking, most cases of preemption in the labor\r\nfield involve  conflict, or potential conflict, between state\r\nlaw and federal  labor policy.   But  sometimes the  conflict\r\narises out of some source other than the need to  interpret a\r\nlabor  agreement.   E.g.,  Livadas;  San  Diego Bldg.  Trades\r                                                                         \r\nCouncil v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236 (1959).\r                             \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     Rather, Shaw's argues that Massachusetts has as a matter\r\n\nof  state law chosen to make the substantive rights conferred\r                                \r\n\nby the  statutes depend  upon their not  being \"inconsistent\"\r\n\nwith  a labor  agreement.   This court  endorsed just  such a\r\n\nreading  of the proviso of section 75B, which is identical in\r\n\nsubstance to the provision of section 75A, in Magerer v. John\r                                                                         \r\n\nSexton &amp;  Co., 912  F.2d 525, 529-30  (1st Cir.  1990).   And\r                         \r\n\nMagerer merely holds Massachusetts  to the literal wording of\r                   \r\n\nits own statute.\r\n\n     The question  remains whether Shaw's  labor agreement is\r\n\ncolorably  inconsistent  with   Martin's  state-law   claims.\r\n\nShaw's best argument rests  upon the agreement's  \"management\r\n\nrights\" clause, which states that Shaw's has the \"sole  right\r\n\nto manage its business including . .  . the right[] . . .  to\r\n\nhire, assign and promote Employees.\"  Shaw's says that Martin\r\n\nis  a  former  employee  seeking  to  be  rehired,  that  the\r\n\nagreement regulates  this  subject (but  not  in a  way  that\r\n\nprotects Martin in this case), and that in all other respects\r\n\nthe union has  agreed to management's  right to choose  which\r\n\nformer employees to rehire.\r\n\n     Martin  responds  that  the \"management  rights\"  clause\r\n\ncannot be inconsistent with her state-law claims in this case\r\n\nbecause  she is no longer covered  by the agreement.  Yet the\r\n\nagreement  does give  former  Shaw's employees  some specific\r\n\npriority  rights to  be rehired.   See  Collective Bargaining\r                                                  \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nAgreement Art. 12(B)  (\"Full-time employees laid off  because\r\n\nof lack of  work when  no other full-time  work is  available\r\n\nshall be offered  part-time work  [if available] .  . .  .\").\r\n\nAnd  the \"management  rights\"  clause by  its terms  embraces\r\n\ndecisions as to hiring.\r\n\n     Martin   next  says   that   Shaw's  employee   handbook\r\n\nguarantees  to her  the very  right to  priority  in rehiring\r\n\nestablished  by  section  75A.   The  handbook  does  contain\r\n\nlanguage  that  is  fairly  close to  the  rehiring  priority\r\n\ncontained  in  section  75A,  suggesting  that  Shaw's itself\r\n\ntreats  this  priority right  (although  not necessarily  the\r\n\nprotection  against  retaliation)   as  consistent  with  its\r\n\n\"management rights\"  clause.  But for  purposes of construing\r\n\nthe \"management  rights\" clause,  the handbook  is at  best a\r\n\ngloss.  \r\n\n     Whether the handbook does constitute a gloss and, if so,\r\n\nwhat weight it should be given are issues of interpreting the\r\n\ncollective bargaining  agreement.    The  handbook  may  well\r\n\nweaken Shaw's reliance on the \"management rights\" clause; but\r\n\nthe  handbook may simply be  a reference to  state law, whose\r\n\napplication  Shaw's   has  now  rethought  in   the  face  of\r\n\nlitigation.    To entertain  Martin's state-law  claims would\r\n\nstill require  a court to  interpret the agreement,  which is\r\n\nprecisely    what    Supreme    Court   precedents    forbid.\r\n\nAccord Magerer, 912 F.2d at 530.\r                          \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     Martin next asserts that  any waiver of statutory rights\r\n\nby  a  union  and   management  in  a  collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement must be \"clear and unmistakable.\"  See Livadas, 114\r                                                                    \r\n\nS. Ct. at  2079 (citations omitted).   But Shaw's  preemption\r\n\nclaim  does   not  depend   upon  a  \"waiver\"   of  statutory\r\n\nprotections; indeed,  it is  unclear under  Massachusetts law\r\n\nthat the statutory protections  can be \"waived.\"  Cf.   Mass.\r                                                                 \r\n\nGen. Laws ch. 152,    75B(3) (limiting waiver).   Rather, the\r\n\nstatutes  themselves expressly  withhold protection  where it\r\n\nwould   be  \"inconsistent\"  with  labor  agreements,  without\r\n\nrequiring the inconsistency to be \"clear and unmistakable.\"\r\n\n     We conclude  that under Supreme Court  and First Circuit\r\n\nprecedent, Martin's state law claims are preempted.  This  is\r\n\nnot   because   the   collective   bargaining   agreement  is\r                                                                         \r\n\ninconsistent with  the state claims asserted,  but because it\r\n\nmay be so  and requires interpretation.   We could  ourselves\r               \r\n\nremove the doubt by interpreting the agreement one way or the\r\n\nother, but  this course has  been foreclosed in  deference to\r\n\nthe arbitration clause.   As  all of this  appears to  follow\r\n\nlogically,  the question  remains  why the  outcome may  seem\r\n\nfaintly troubling.\r\n\n     One  reason  is that  Massachusetts'  statutory proviso,\r\n\nmaking  the  rights  conferred  yield  to inconsistent  labor\r\n\nagreements,   may  be   producing   some  results   that  the\r\n\nlegislature  did not intend.   When the statutes were enacted\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nin December  1985, Massachusetts might have  thought that the\r\n\nproviso  was necessary to  avoid preemption;  the legislature\r                                            \r\n\nmight  be   chagrined  to  discover  that   the  proviso  has\r\n\nunnecessarily curtailed workers' rights.  But this is at best\r\n\na  debatable  inference,3  and   we  have  found  no  helpful\r\n\nlegislative history. \r\n\n     Possibly, the proviso could be construed to require more\r\n\nthan  mere inconsistency.  Or  a state court  could hold that\r\n\nthe rights conferred yield only to highly specific provisions\r\n\nin a labor agreement and not to a generic \"management rights\"\r\n\nclause.  But both readings would ignore the explicit language\r\n\nof the proviso.  Perhaps the state did intend to defer to the\r\n\nlabor agreement even where it assisted the employer.  Despite\r\n\nthe clear warning sent by  Magerer in 1990, Massachusetts has\r                                              \r\n\nnot chosen to amend the statutes.\r\n\n     The  other reason why the  outcome may seem troubling is\r\n\nthat it could result in Martin having no claim at all against\r\n\nShaw's,  even for  retaliation.   This charge is,  of course,\r\n\nmerely  an  allegation;  but  even  if   it  proved  to  have\r\n\nsubstance, it  would be  preempted because of  the collective\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     3Shortly  before  the  legislature acted  in  1985,  the\r\nSupreme  Court made clear that section 301 does not \"give the\r\nsubstantive  provisions  of private  agreements the  force of\r\nfederal  law,  ousting  any  inconsistent  state regulation.\"\r\nAllis-Chalmers, 471 U.S. at 212.   See also Metropolitan Life\r                                                                         \r\nIns.  Co.  v.  Massachusetts,  471 U.S.  724,  755-56  (1985)\r                                        \r\n(holding that state mandated-benefits laws were not generally\r\npreempted).\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nbargaining  agreement,  and  yet  the  agreement  may  itself\r\n\nprovide no  remedy.   Preemption sometimes does  result in  a\r\n\ncomplete denial of remedies for obvious wrong, e.g., Smith v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nDunham-Busch, Inc., 959 F.2d  6, 11 (2d Cir. 1992),  but this\r                              \r\n\nis not a result one eagerly embraces.  \r\n\n     Various possibilities may cushion  this outcome.  If the\r\n\nemployee  handbook is  a gloss  on the  collective bargaining\r                                 \r\n\nagreement,  perhaps  the language  already mentioned  may not\r\n\nonly  defeat the  \"management rights\"  defense but  also give\r\n\nrise to affirmative obligations  on the part of  the employer\r\n\nenforceable through  arbitration.   Or,  perhaps  arbitration\r\n\nwould yield a definitive  ruling that the \"management rights\"\r\n\nclause,  and any other clause  relied upon by  Shaw's, is not\r\n\n\"inconsistent\" with  the rights  contingently secured  by the\r\n\nstatutes.  \r\n\n     If all  else  fails,  the union  is  free  to  negotiate\r\n\nlanguage that eliminates this issue  the next time it  renews\r\n\nits  labor  agreement.     The  parties  entered  the current\r\n\nagreement in 1994,  well after Magerer  was decided, but  the\r                                                  \r\n\nabsence of such language  in the present agreement may  be an\r\n\noversight.  All that  it would take to prevent  preemption is\r\n\nan explicit  provision stating that nothing  in the agreement\r\n\nis intended to create management rights inconsistent with any\r\n\nworkers' rights under sections 75A and 75B.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\n     Finally, in a reply  brief, Martin and her  union (which\r\n\nappears as an amicus  and has ably supported Martin)  offer a\r\n\npreemption  claim of their own.   They say  that a discharged\r\n\nnon-union  worker could invoke the Massachusetts statutes and\r\n\nthat  by allowing  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  to\r\n\nextinguish   Martin's   rights,  the   Massachusetts  proviso\r\n\ndiscriminates against  members or  former members  of unions,\r\n\nthereby  offending federal  labor  policy.   This, they  say,\r\n\nLivadas itself forbids.\r                   \r\n\n     Livadas  struck down  a  state  administrative  practice\r                        \r\n\nbecause it effectively discriminated against union members as\r\n\ncompared  with   non-members,  114  S.  Ct.   at  2074-75,  a\r\n\npreemption theory that  has nothing to  do with section  301.\r\n\nOn the reasoning of Livadas, Massachusetts arguably could not\r                                       \r\n\nprovide  that  a  rehiring   priority,  or  a  claim  against\r\n\nretaliation, would be made available only to workers who were\r\n\nnot  members of  a union.   But  here Massachusetts  has done\r\n\nnothing of the kind.\r\n\n     Instead, the  proviso in  question permits the  union on\r\n\nbehalf of its members to craft its own regime (the agreement)\r\n\nand  in it,  either to  preserve or  displace another  regime\r\n\n(specified provisions of  state law).   Viewed in the  large,\r\n\nthere  is no discrimination  whatever against  union members;\r\n\nMassachusetts  simply allows  the  union to  negotiate for  a\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\ndifferent  package of benefits.  Next time, as we have noted,\r\n\nthe union is free to bargain differently.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n",

This  case,  presenting   a\r                                        \r\n\ndifficult  preemption  issue,  began  in  January  1996  when\r\n\nTheresa   Martin   sued   Shaw's   Supermarkets,   Inc.,   in\r\n\nMassachusetts state  court for  alleged  violations of  state\r\n\nemployment-compensation laws.   Martin, an employee of Shaw's\r\n\nsince 1979, had injured her back in August 1994 while working\r\n\nas  a bakery clerk.   In September 1994,  she began receiving\r\n\nworkers'   compensation   benefits   for    temporary   total\r\n\ndisability.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152,   34.\r\n\n     In March 1995, Shaw's requested that Martin's physician,\r\n\nDr.  James Coleman, establish any necessary work restrictions\r\n\nfor  Martin.    Coleman  gave   Shaw's  a  list  of  physical\r\n\nrestrictions and  indicated that Martin could  return to work\r\n\nif  these restrictions  were  respected.   Shaw's then  asked\r\n\nMartin  to  see  a  second  doctor.    Based  on  the  second\r\n\nexamination, Shaw's  offered  Martin four  weeks of  modified\r\n\nduty, to be followed by return to her former position without\r\n\nrestrictions.\r\n\n     Martin did not  return to  work.   Instead, through  her\r\n\nattorney,  she  again  asked   for  a  position  fitting  the\r\n\nrestrictions  set  by Coleman.    Shaw's  responded by  again\r\n\noffering  Martin  her former  position with  no restrictions.\r\n\nWhen  discussion failed  to resolve  the matter,  Shaw's sent\r\n\nMartin  a letter in September 1995 informing her that she was\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nterminated.    The  letter  referred to  Shaw's  \"policy  and\r\n\ncontract language concerning extended periods of absence.\"\r\n\n     On  October 19,  1995,  Martin reapplied  for  full-time\r\n\nemployment with  Shaw's, requesting  a  position with  duties\r\n\nmodified as Coleman had recommended.  Shaw's did not respond.\r\n\nLater in the month,  Martin's union filed a grievance  on her\r\n\nbehalf under its collective bargaining agreement with Shaw's,\r\n\nalleging  that  Martin  had  been   unjustly  terminated  and\r\n\nrequesting her reinstatement with reasonable accommodations.\r\n\n     Three months  later, Martin filed the  present action in\r\n\nMassachusetts  state court, claiming that Shaw's had violated\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 152,    75A, 75B(2), by failing to rehire\r\n\nher.  These sections  provide, respectively, that an employee\r\n\nwho lost  her job as a  result of compensable injury  must be\r\n\ngiven rehiring  preference by  the former employer  over non-\r\n\nemployee  applicants, id.    75A,  and that  no employer  may\r                                     \r\n\nrefuse  to hire an  employee because she  asserted a workers'\r\n\ncompensation  claim, id.    75B(2).   Martin's  suit did  not\r                                    \r\n\ncontest Shaw's right to discharge her  in the first instance.\r\n\n     In  March 1996,  Shaw's  removed the  action to  federal\r\n\ncourt,  premising jurisdiction  under 28  U.S.C.   1331,  and\r\n\nmoved to dismiss,  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 12(b)(6).   The  district\r\n\ncourt  granted Shaw's motion,  agreeing that  Martin's claims\r\n\nwere  preempted  by  section  301  of  the  Labor  Management\r\n\nRelations  Act, 29  U.S.C.   185.

The  sole issue  on appeal  is whether  section 301\r\n\npreempts Martin's state-law claims.1 \r\n\n     Section  301 modestly  provides  only that  \"[s]uits for\r\n\nviolation  of  contracts  between  an employer  and  a  labor\r\n\norganization representing employees  . . . may  be brought in\r\n\nany district  court of the United  States having jurisdiction\r\n\nof the  parties . . . .\"   29 U.S.C.   185.

Livadas, 114 S. Ct. at 2078.\r                             \r\n\n     Martin  has alleged  violations of  Mass. Gen.  Laws ch.\r\n\n152,     75A, 75B(2).   Section  75A creates  a  priority for\r\n\nrehiring:\r\n\n     Any  person who has  lost a job  as a result  of an\r\n     injury  compensable  under  this  chapter  shall be\r\n     given preference in hiring by the employer for whom\r\n     he worked  at the  time of compensable  injury over\r\n     any  persons not  at  the time  of application  for\r\n     reemployment employed by  such employer;  provided,\r\n     however, that a suitable job is available.\r\n\nThe   relevant  portion  of  section  75B(2)--a  conventional\r\n\nprohibition against retaliation--states that \"[n]o employer .\r\n\n.  . shall  . .  .  refuse to  hire  or in  any other  manner\r\n\ndiscriminate against  an employee  because  the employee  has\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nexercised  a  right afforded  by this  [workers compensation]\r\n\nchapter.\"  \r\n\n     If the statutes stopped here,  this might be a different\r\n\ncase.   But  both statutory sections  also contain  a proviso\r\n\nthat \"[i]n the event any right  set forth in this section  is\r\n\ninconsistent   with   an  applicable   collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement,\" the agreement shall prevail.  Id.    75A, 75B(3).\r                                                         \r\n\nShaw's  argues that  both  of Martin's  statutory claims  are\r\n\ninconsistent with  the  labor agreement;  that resolution  of\r\n\nthis  \"inconsistency\" charge  requires interpretation  of the\r\n\nagreement; and that the  claims are therefore preempted under\r\n\nthe Supreme Court's own rubric.\r\n\n     It is  very doubtful  whether, without  this last-quoted\r\n\nproviso,  Shaw's would  have any  plausible claim  of federal\r\n\npreemption.    Massachusetts has  an independent  interest in\r\n\nregulating  injury compensation; and  apart from the proviso,\r\n\nthe elements of both Martin's  state-law claims appear to  be\r\n\nindependent  of bargaining  agreement provisions.   There are\r\n\nother types of labor preemption, apart from Lingle's \"require\r                                                              \r\n\nconstruing\" test,2  but Shaw's  does not argue  that Martin's\r\n\nstate claims would be preempted absent the proviso.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Broadly speaking, most cases of preemption in the labor\r\nfield involve  conflict, or potential conflict, between state\r\nlaw and federal  labor policy.   But  sometimes the  conflict\r\narises out of some source other than the need to  interpret a\r\nlabor  agreement.   E.g.,  Livadas;  San  Diego Bldg.

And\r                         \r\n\nMagerer merely holds Massachusetts  to the literal wording of\r                   \r\n\nits own statute.\r\n\n     The question  remains whether Shaw's  labor agreement is\r\n\ncolorably  inconsistent  with   Martin's  state-law   claims.\r\n\nShaw's best argument rests  upon the agreement's  \"management\r\n\nrights\" clause, which states that Shaw's has the \"sole  right\r\n\nto manage its business including . .  . the right[] . . .  to\r\n\nhire, assign and promote Employees.\"  Shaw's says that Martin\r\n\nis  a  former  employee  seeking  to  be  rehired,  that  the\r\n\nagreement regulates  this  subject (but  not  in a  way  that\r\n\nprotects Martin in this case), and that in all other respects\r\n\nthe union has  agreed to management's  right to choose  which\r\n\nformer employees to rehire.\r\n\n     Martin  responds  that  the \"management  rights\"  clause\r\n\ncannot be inconsistent with her state-law claims in this case\r\n\nbecause  she is no longer covered  by the agreement.  Yet the\r\n\nagreement  does give  former  Shaw's employees  some specific\r\n\npriority  rights to  be rehired.   See  Collective Bargaining\r                                                  \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nAgreement Art. 12(B)  (\"Full-time employees laid off  because\r\n\nof lack of  work when  no other full-time  work is  available\r\n\nshall be offered  part-time work  [if available] .  . .  .\").\r\n\nAnd  the \"management  rights\"  clause by  its terms  embraces\r\n\ndecisions as to hiring.\r\n\n     Martin   next  says   that   Shaw's  employee   handbook\r\n\nguarantees  to her  the very  right to  priority  in rehiring\r\n\nestablished  by  section  75A.   The  handbook  does  contain\r\n\nlanguage  that  is  fairly  close to  the  rehiring  priority\r\n\ncontained  in  section  75A,  suggesting  that  Shaw's itself\r\n\ntreats  this  priority right  (although  not necessarily  the\r\n\nprotection  against  retaliation)   as  consistent  with  its\r\n\n\"management rights\"  clause.  But for  purposes of construing\r\n\nthe \"management  rights\" clause,  the handbook  is at  best a\r\n\ngloss.  \r\n\n     Whether the handbook does constitute a gloss and, if so,\r\n\nwhat weight it should be given are issues of interpreting the\r\n\ncollective bargaining  agreement.    The  handbook  may  well\r\n\nweaken Shaw's reliance on the \"management rights\" clause; but\r\n\nthe  handbook may simply be  a reference to  state law, whose\r\n\napplication  Shaw's   has  now  rethought  in   the  face  of\r\n\nlitigation.    To entertain  Martin's state-law  claims would\r\n\nstill require  a court to  interpret the agreement,  which is\r\n\nprecisely    what    Supreme    Court   precedents    forbid.\r\n\nAccord Magerer, 912 F.2d at 530.\r                          \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     Martin next asserts that  any waiver of statutory rights\r\n\nby  a  union  and   management  in  a  collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement must be \"clear and unmistakable.\"  See Livadas, 114\r                                                                    \r\n\nS. Ct. at  2079 (citations omitted).   But Shaw's  preemption\r\n\nclaim  does   not  depend   upon  a  \"waiver\"   of  statutory\r\n\nprotections; indeed,  it is  unclear under  Massachusetts law\r\n\nthat the statutory protections  can be \"waived.\"  Cf.   Mass.\r                                                                 \r\n\nGen. Laws ch. 152,    75B(3) (limiting waiver).   Rather, the\r\n\nstatutes  themselves expressly  withhold protection  where it\r\n\nwould   be  \"inconsistent\"  with  labor  agreements,  without\r\n\nrequiring the inconsistency to be \"clear and unmistakable.\"\r\n\n     We conclude  that under Supreme Court  and First Circuit\r\n\nprecedent, Martin's state law claims are preempted.  This  is\r\n\nnot   because   the   collective   bargaining   agreement  is\r                                                                         \r\n\ninconsistent with  the state claims asserted,  but because it\r\n\nmay be so  and requires interpretation.   We could  ourselves\r               \r\n\nremove the doubt by interpreting the agreement one way or the\r\n\nother, but  this course has  been foreclosed in  deference to\r\n\nthe arbitration clause.   As  all of this  appears to  follow\r\n\nlogically,  the question  remains  why the  outcome may  seem\r\n\nfaintly troubling.\r\n\n     One  reason  is that  Massachusetts'  statutory proviso,\r\n\nmaking  the  rights  conferred  yield  to inconsistent  labor\r\n\nagreements,   may  be   producing   some  results   that  the\r\n\nlegislature  did not intend.   When the statutes were enacted\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nin December  1985, Massachusetts might have  thought that the\r\n\nproviso  was necessary to  avoid preemption;  the legislature\r                                            \r\n\nmight  be   chagrined  to  discover  that   the  proviso  has\r\n\nunnecessarily curtailed workers' rights.  But this is at best\r\n\na  debatable  inference,3  and   we  have  found  no  helpful\r\n\nlegislative history. \r\n\n     Possibly, the proviso could be construed to require more\r\n\nthan  mere inconsistency.  Or  a state court  could hold that\r\n\nthe rights conferred yield only to highly specific provisions\r\n\nin a labor agreement and not to a generic \"management rights\"\r\n\nclause.  But both readings would ignore the explicit language\r\n\nof the proviso.  Perhaps the state did intend to defer to the\r\n\nlabor agreement even where it assisted the employer.  Despite\r\n\nthe clear warning sent by  Magerer in 1990, Massachusetts has\r                                              \r\n\nnot chosen to amend the statutes.\r\n\n     The  other reason why the  outcome may seem troubling is\r\n\nthat it could result in Martin having no claim at all against\r\n\nShaw's,  even for  retaliation.   This charge is,  of course,\r\n\nmerely  an  allegation;  but  even  if   it  proved  to  have\r\n\nsubstance, it  would be  preempted because of  the collective\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     3Shortly  before  the  legislature acted  in  1985,  the\r\nSupreme  Court made clear that section 301 does not \"give the\r\nsubstantive  provisions  of private  agreements the  force of\r\nfederal  law,  ousting  any  inconsistent  state regulation.\"\r\nAllis-Chalmers, 471 U.S. at 212.

If the\r\n\nemployee  handbook is  a gloss  on the  collective bargaining\r                                 \r\n\nagreement,  perhaps  the language  already mentioned  may not\r\n\nonly  defeat the  \"management rights\"  defense but  also give\r\n\nrise to affirmative obligations  on the part of  the employer\r\n\nenforceable through  arbitration.   Or,  perhaps  arbitration\r\n\nwould yield a definitive  ruling that the \"management rights\"\r\n\nclause,  and any other clause  relied upon by  Shaw's, is not\r\n\n\"inconsistent\" with  the rights  contingently secured  by the\r\n\nstatutes.  \r\n\n     If all  else  fails,  the union  is  free  to  negotiate\r\n\nlanguage that eliminates this issue  the next time it  renews\r\n\nits  labor  agreement.     The  parties  entered  the current\r\n\nagreement in 1994,  well after Magerer  was decided, but  the\r                                                  \r\n\nabsence of such language  in the present agreement may  be an\r\n\noversight.  All that  it would take to prevent  preemption is\r\n\nan explicit  provision stating that nothing  in the agreement\r\n\nis intended to create management rights inconsistent with any\r\n\nworkers' rights under sections 75A and 75B.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\n     Finally, in a reply  brief, Martin and her  union (which\r\n\nappears as an amicus  and has ably supported Martin)  offer a\r\n\npreemption  claim of their own.   They say  that a discharged\r\n\nnon-union  worker could invoke the Massachusetts statutes and\r\n\nthat  by allowing  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  to\r\n\nextinguish   Martin's   rights,  the   Massachusetts  proviso\r\n\ndiscriminates against  members or  former members  of unions,\r\n\nthereby  offending federal  labor  policy.   This, they  say,\r\n\nLivadas itself forbids.\r                   \r\n\n     Livadas  struck down  a  state  administrative  practice\r                        \r\n\nbecause it effectively discriminated against union members as\r\n\ncompared  with   non-members,  114  S.  Ct.   at  2074-75,  a\r\n\npreemption theory that  has nothing to  do with section  301.\r\n\nOn the reasoning of Livadas, Massachusetts arguably could not\r                                       \r\n\nprovide  that  a  rehiring   priority,  or  a  claim  against\r\n\nretaliation, would be made available only to workers who were\r\n\nnot  members of  a union.   But  here Massachusetts  has done\r\n\nnothing of the kind.\r\n\n     Instead, the  proviso in  question permits the  union on\r\n\nbehalf of its members to craft its own regime (the agreement)\r\n\nand  in it,  either to  preserve or  displace another  regime\r\n\n(specified provisions of  state law).   Viewed in the  large,\r\n\nthere  is no discrimination  whatever against  union members;\r\n\nMassachusetts  simply allows  the  union to  negotiate for  a\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\ndifferent  package of benefits.  Next time, as we have noted,\r\n\nthe union is free to bargain differently.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n</pre>",
