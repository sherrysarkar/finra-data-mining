Margot    Nickerson-Malpher,    who     became\n\npermanently disabled on August 6, 1993, claims entitlement to\n\ninter vivos disability payments under her former employer’s Life\n\nInsurance Plan; the defendants, her former employer and its life\n\ninsurance providers, counter that the Plan in which Nickerson-\n\nMalpher was enrolled only entitled her to a death benefit upon\n\nbecoming permanently disabled.         She appeals the District Court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment to the defendants and denial of her\n\ncross-motion.      For the reasons that follow, summary judgment is\n\naffirmed.\n\n            Market Forge Co. hired Nickerson-Malpher on November\n\n27, 1989.   She participated in both the company’s Life Insurance\n\nPlan and its Retirement Plan.          The Life Insurance Plan offered\n\ntwo    different     disability   benefits:     1)   for    people     also\n\nparticipating in the Retirement Plan (“Disability 1\"); and 2)\n\nfor people not participating in the Retirement Plan (“Disability\n\n2\").    Disability 1 provided, in relevant part, that if an\n\ninsured “becomes totally disabled . . . the Company . . . will\n\npay to his beneficiary the amount of Total Disability Benefit in\n\neffect as provided . . . [and] no payment of premium will be\n\nrequired for the Person while this Benefit is in effect.”\n\n            In contrast, Disability 2 provided that if an insured\n\n“becomes totally disabled . . . the Company . . . will pay to\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe Person in sixty consecutive installments, a monthly income\n\nof $18.15 for each $1,000 of life insurance in force on his life\n\nas of the date such total disability commenced; and . . . will\n\nprovide without further payment of premium . . . a death benefit\n\npayable to his beneficiary . . . equal to the commuted value of\n\nthe unpaid installments.”           The sole difference between whether\n\nan insured is entitled to death benefits under Disability 1 or\n\ninter vivos benefits under Disability 2 is whether the insured\n\nparticipated in the company’s Retirement Plan.\n\n            Nickerson-Malpher became totally disabled, as defined\n\nin the plan, on August 6, 1993.               In November 1993, Market Forge\n\nCo.’s    parent,    Specialty     Equipment       Co.,    sold   Market    Forge’s\n\nassets    to   a    group    of   its   employees.          As   part     of   that\n\ntransaction, Specialty paid out to all non-vested employees,\n\nincluding      Nickerson-Malpher,             their   non-vested       retirement\n\nbenefits    under    the    Retirement        Plan.      Therefore,    Nickerson-\n\nMalpher received a lump sum payment as a non-vested participant\n\nin the Retirement Plan.\n\n            On December 20, 1993, Nickerson-Malpher applied for the\n\ninter vivos disability benefits under the Disability 2 provision\n\nof the Life Insurance Plan.          Through a series of correspondence\n\nover     several    years,    the    Life       Insurance    Company      informed\n\nNickerson-Malpher that she did not qualify for Disability 2, but\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fapproved her claim under the terms of Disability 1 on the\n\ngrounds     that   Nickerson-Malpher       had   participated    in    the\n\nRetirement Plan.\n\n            On July 29, 1998, Nickerson-Malpher filed her Complaint\n\nin   this   case   under   29   U.S.C.    §1132(a)(1)(B)   (1994).     The\n\ndefendants moved for summary judgment, and Nickerson-Malpher\n\nfiled a cross-motion for summary judgment.           The District Court\n\nheld a hearing on summary judgment on March 22, 2000.                 In a\n\nMemorandum of Decision dated December 28, 2000, the Court denied\n\nNickerson-Malpher’s motion for summary judgment and granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the defendants.          Nickerson-Malpher\n\nthen instituted this appeal.\n\n            A denial of benefits by an ERISA fiduciary challenged\n\nunder 29 U.S.C. §1132(a)(1)(B) is reviewed de novo.

Co., 26 F.3d 264, 267 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nWhere, as here, the parties stipulated to the material facts and\n\nthe outcome turns entirely on the interpretation of the relevant\n\nplan documents, the de novo standard authorizes the district\n\ncourt to decide the dispute “as matters of law are decided.”\n\nRecupero v. New England Tel. and Tel. Co., 118 F.3d 820, 839\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f           As such, our review of the evidence stipulated to below\n\ngives us no reason to question the District Court’s findings.\n\nNickerson-Malpher was unquestionably covered by her employer’s\n\nLife Insurance Plan.        According to the plain and unambiguous\n\nlanguage of the Life Insurance Plan documents, if Nickerson-\n\nMalpher also participated in her employer’s Retirement Plan\n\nthen, following her disability, she was only entitled to the\n\nLife   Insurance   Plan’s    death    benefit,   not   its   inter   vivos\n\nbenefit.   The evidence shows that Nickerson-Malpher did indeed\n\nparticipate in the Retirement Plan while she was employed with\n\nMarket Forge; the fact that she accepted a lump-sum payout from\n\nthe Retirement Plan several months after her disability further\n\ndemonstrates this fact.        Therefore, the Life Insurance Plan\n\nprovides a plain and unambiguous benefit for Nickerson-Malpher,\n\nand that is a death benefit, not an inter vivos one.           Thus, the\n\nevidence does not demonstrate that a genuine issue of material\n\nfact exists to warrant trial in this case, and the District\n\nCourt properly granted Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",
