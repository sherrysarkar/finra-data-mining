Frank H. Freedman, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n          Selya, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Joshua L. Gordon for appellant.\n     Jennifer Hay Zacks, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                        June 22, 2001\n\f            LIPEZ,     Circuit       Judge.     Daniel     Burgos    appeals   his\n\nconvictions and sentence for one count of attempting to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n846 and § 841(a)(1), and one count of money laundering in\n\nviolation    of   18   U.S.C.     §    1956(a)(1)(A)(i).        He    makes    five\n\narguments:    (1)      that    the    indictment     is    defective    for    not\n\nsufficiently      alleging        proof       that   the    money     laundering\n\ntransaction affected interstate commerce; (2) that the evidence\n\nwas insufficient to convict him on both charges; (3) that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in not severing the two\n\ncharges; (4) that the government violated the Speedy Trial Act,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3161(b), in charging him with money laundering; and\n\n(5) that the district court erred in sentencing him on the\n\ncocaine conviction.           For the reasons that follow, we affirm his\n\nconvictions on both counts, as well as his sentence.\n\n                                 I. Background\n\n            The government's case against Burgos originated with\n\nthe arrest of William O'Neil on February 10, 1999 by the Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration.               Agreeing to cooperate with the\n\ngovernment that same day, O'Neil arranged with Burgos, in a\n\nrecorded telephone call, for Burgos to purchase two kilograms of\n\ncocaine at a price of $22,000 per kilogram.                When Burgos arrived\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fat the designated meeting place for the transaction, he was\n\narrested immediately.      Burgos had not yet obtained the cocaine\n\nfrom O'Neil at the time of his arrest and he had not yet had the\n\nopportunity to observe whether O'Neil was in possession of any\n\ncocaine.        Burgos was carrying $44,000 in cash when he was\n\narrested.\n\n            The grand jury returned an indictment on February 25,\n\n1999 charging Burgos with attempting to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine. After further investigation, the government\n\nobtained a search warrant for Burgos's residence, which it\n\nexecuted on March 9.     Various documents, including financial and\n\nemployment records, were seized at that time.             Based on those\n\nrecords,    a    superseding    indictment   was    returned    on    June   17\n\ncharging Burgos with money laundering and renewing the drug\n\ncharge.     Following a three-day trial, a jury convicted him of\n\nboth counts on August 18, 1999.           The district court sentenced\n\nBurgos in January 2000 to 108 months in prison.\n\n   II. Allegations of Interstate Commerce in the Indictment\n\n            Burgos     argues     that    the      indictment        contained\n\ninsufficient allegations that his monetary transaction affected\n\ninterstate commerce.      Because he did not raise this claim below,\n\nwe review for plain error.         See United States v. Mojica-Baez,\n\n229 F.3d 292, 307 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            The indictment charged that Burgos:\n\n            did knowingly and willfully conduct and\n            attempt to conduct a financial transaction,\n            to wit, the delivery of $44,000 in cash,\n            which said cash involved the proceeds of a\n            specified unlawful activity, that is, the\n            distribution of a controlled substance, a\n            violation of Title 21, United States Code,\n            Section 841(a)(1), with the intent to\n            promote the carrying on of a specified\n            unlawful activity, to wit, the distribution\n            of cocaine, a violation of Title 21, United\n            States Code, Section 841(a)(1), and that\n            while conducting and attempting to conduct\n            such financial transaction knew that the\n            cash represented the proceeds of unlawful\n            activity.\n\nThe language of the indictment does not allege specifically that\n\nthe   transaction   affected   interstate   commerce.     However,\n\n\"financial transaction\" is defined as \"a transaction which in\n\nany way or degree affects interstate or foreign commerce.\"      18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(c)(4)(A).    Moreover, the indictment specifically\n\nalleged that the financial transaction at issue was Burgos's\n\nattempt to purchase cocaine for $44,000.      It is well-settled\n\nthat drug trafficking is an activity that affects interstate\n\ncommerce.    See United States v. Zorilla, 93 F.3d 7, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1996); see also United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 755 (1st\n\nCir. 1999); United States v. Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d 9, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).    We conclude, therefore, that the indictment\n\nsufficiently alleged interstate commerce as an element of the\n\ncrime, and that Burgos was on notice of that element.          Cf.\n\n                                -4-\n\fUnited States v. Cefaratti, 221 F.3d 502, 507 (3d Cir. 2000)\n\n(\"[A]n indictment that charges a legal term of art sufficiently\n\ncharges the component parts of that term.\" (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)); United States v. Kovach, 208 F.3d 1215, 1219\n\n(10th Cir. 2000) (finding that the indictment adequately charged\n\nthe   interstate       commerce    element   by   using   the   word\n\n\"organization,\" a term of art defined by statute as an entity\n\nthat affects interstate commerce); United States v. Wicks, 187\n\nF.3d 426, 428 (4th Cir. 1999) (same).        Indeed, Burgos does not\n\nclaim in his brief that he lacked notice of this element.\n\nMoreover, even assuming that the charging language was in error,\n\nBurgos has not even attempted to show the prejudice required by\n\nthe plain error standard.         See United States v. Balgyga, 233\n\nF.3d 674, 682 (1st Cir. 2000).        Thus, we reject Burgos's claim\n\nthat his conviction should be reversed because of an error in\n\nthe indictment.\n\n                  III. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            In assessing Burgos's challenges to the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence, we must determine whether the evidence taken in\n\nthe light most favorable to the prosecution supports the guilty\n\nverdicts.    See id.\n\nA. Attempt to Possess with Intent to Distribute Cocaine\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f           Burgos was convicted of attempting to possess cocaine\n\nwith intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(a)(1)1 and 21 U.S.C. § 846.2          He argues that a rational jury\n\ncould not have convicted him because there was no actual cocaine\n\ninvolved   in   the   transaction    between    him     and   O'Neil.      The\n\ngovernment concedes that Burgos was arrested before he came into\n\npossession of any cocaine, and that O'Neil did not have any\n\ncocaine with him when he met Burgos to complete the transaction.\n\n           Contrary to Burgos's assertion, neither O'Neil nor\n\nBurgos had to possess cocaine at the time of the contemplated\n\ntransaction to satisfy the elements of this crime.                 \"To prove\n\nattempt, the government must establish both an intent to commit\n\nthe substantive offense and a substantial step towards its\n\ncommission.\"    United States v. Argencourt, 996 F.2d 1300, 1303\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).                 The step\n\ntowards    completion   of    the   crime    \"must    be   more    than   mere\n\npreparation.\"         Id.    (internal      quotation      marks   omitted).\n\n\n    1  21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) provides, in pertinent part, that\n\"it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\n. . . to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with\nintent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled\nsubstance.\"\n    2  21 U.S.C. § 846 provides: \"Any person who attempts or\nconspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall\nbe subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the\noffense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt\nor conspiracy.\"\n\n                                    -6-\n\fNonetheless, an individual accused of attempt to possess cocaine\n\n\"does not have to get very far along the line toward ultimate\n\ncommission of the object crime in order to commit the attempt\n\noffense.\"       United States v. Doyon, 194 F.3d 207, 211 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n               A rational jury could have found easily that Burgos\n\ndemonstrated an intent to commit the substantive offense of\n\npossessing       cocaine      with     intent     to    distribute            it.        Law\n\nenforcement       officers         testified    that      Burgos         arranged        the\n\ntransaction with O'Neil over the course of six telephone calls.\n\nShortly    before       the   agreed-upon       meeting       time,       surveillance\n\nofficers       observed    Burgos     leave    his     home    in    a   car,       closely\n\nfollowed by an individual in another car.                           The drug agents\n\ntestified that the presence of this second car was consistent\n\nwith     the    practice      of     bringing     security          to    a    narcotics\n\ntransaction.          The officers then observed Burgos arrive at the\n\nlocation that he and O'Neil had specified carrying $44,000 in\n\ncash, a sum corresponding to the price and quantity of cocaine\n\nhe had agreed to purchase - two kilograms at $22,000 each.\n\nBurgos approached O'Neil and was immediately arrested.                                   This\n\nevidence       establishes     Burgos's        criminal       intent      and       further\n\nconstitutes       a    substantial      step    towards       commission            of    the\n\nsubstantive offense of possessing cocaine.                    Whether he or O'Neil\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fdid in fact possess cocaine at some point during the transaction\n\nis irrelevant.\n\nB. Money Laundering\n\n            Burgos was convicted of money laundering in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i).3          He claims that the government\n\nfailed to prove that his attempt to exchange $44,000 in cash for\n\ntwo kilograms of cocaine had a sufficient link to interstate\n\ncommerce.      As   we    have   already   noted,   section   1956   defines\n\n\"financial transaction\" as \"a transaction which in any way or\n\ndegree affects interstate or foreign commerce.\"                18 U.S.C. §\n\n1956(c)(4)(A) (emphasis added). In interpreting this provision,\n\nwe have held that \"[a] minimal effect on interstate commerce is\n\nsufficient to support a conviction.\"           Owens, 167 F.3d at 755.\n\n            For reasons we have already discussed, a rational jury\n\ncould have found that Burgos attempted to purchase two kilograms\n\nof   cocaine   for       $44,000   cash.     The    government   presented\n\nadditional evidence from which a jury could have inferred that\n\n\n     3  18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) provides, in part, that\nmoney laundering is committed whenever a person, \"knowing that\nthe property involved in a financial transaction represents the\nproceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts\nto conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves\nthe proceeds of specified unlawful activity . . . with the\nintent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful\nactivity.\" (Emphasis added.)     Although Burgos was arrested\nbefore he completed the financial transaction in which he had\nplanned to exchange cash for cocaine, § 1956 applies to such\nattempted transactions.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fthe cash was derived from Burgos's involvement in trafficking\n\nnarcotics.    For example, financial and employment records seized\n\nduring a search of Burgos's home indicated that his family's\n\nexpenditures far exceeded the legitimate income produced by him\n\nand his wife.       Plastic bags containing marijuana residue were\n\nalso found during the search.              Government witnesses further\n\ntestified    that    O'Neil   told   Burgos    when   they   arranged   the\n\ntransaction that the person delivering the cocaine to O'Neil had\n\njust arrived from New York and was impatient to return there.\n\nTherefore, the facts of the transaction as Burgos believed them\n\nto be establish the element of interstate commerce.            See United\n\nStates v. Dworken, 855 F.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating that\n\na person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, \"under\n\nthe circumstances as he believes them to be,\" the act is a\n\nsubstantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in\n\na crime (quoting American Law Institute, Model Penal Code §\n\n5.01(1)(c)(1985))).      Additional evidence indicated that most of\n\nthe cocaine in the area of Springfield, Massachusetts at the\n\ntime of Burgos's arrest came from New York, and that both the\n\ncocaine and the money used to purchase it would thus be likely\n\nto travel across state lines.\n\n            It is a well-settled proposition that \"drug trafficking\n\nis precisely the kind of economic enterprise that substantially\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\faffects interstate commerce.\"                Zorilla, 93 F.3d at 8.                 We have\n\nheld in other cases that involvement in the drug trade satisfies\n\nthe     \"effect    on    interstate          commerce\"         prong      of   the        money\n\nlaundering      statute.            See,    e.g.,       Owens,      167    F.3d      at    755\n\n(affirming the conviction where there was evidence that the\n\nmoney    involved       in    the    transaction        was    generated       by    a     drug\n\nenterprise transporting cocaine and cash between Providence and\n\nBoston);     Gonzalez-Maldonado,                 115    F.3d        at    21   (affirming\n\nconviction under § 1956 where the jury could have inferred that\n\nthe defendant engaged in telephone conversations that were part\n\nof    illegal     drug       activity      and    not    a    legitimate       business).\n\nTherefore, we reject Burgos's claim that there was insufficient\n\nproof of a link between his attempted financial transaction and\n\ninterstate commerce.\n\n                                     IV. Severance\n\n            The district court denied Burgos's motion to sever the\n\ntwo counts of the superseding indictment in a written memorandum\n\nand order.        We review that determination for manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion.       See United States v. DeLeon, 187 F.3d 60, 63 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n            Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14 provides: \"If it\n\nappears that a defendant or the government is prejudiced by a\n\njoinder    of     offenses      or    of    defendants         in    an   indictment         or\n\n\n                                            -10-\n\finformation or by such joinder for trial together, the court may\n\norder    an    election    or   separate       trials     of    counts,      grant    a\n\nseverance of defendants or provide whatever other relief justice\n\nrequires.\"       Fed. R. Crim. P. 14 (emphasis added).                        We will\n\noverturn a court's exercise of its discretion in considering a\n\nmotion for severance \"only upon a demonstration of manifest\n\nabuse.\"       United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 246 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).    \"This is a difficult battle for a defendant to win.\n\nThere is always some prejudice in any trial where more than one\n\noffense   or    offender    are    tried     together     -    but    such    'garden\n\nvariety' prejudice, in and of itself, will not suffice.\" Id.\n\nBurgos must demonstrate that the allegedly improper joinder\n\n\"likely   deprived    [him]       of   a   fair   trial.\"      United       States   v.\n\nBartelho, 129 F.3d 663, 678 (1st Cir. 1997) (internal quotation\n\nmarks    omitted).        Burgos's      claim     falls    far      short    of   this\n\nstandard.\n\n              Burgos argues that the jury may have been improperly\n\nled to convict him of both charges because the evidence relating\n\nto one charge tended to prove that he was of bad character\n\ngenerally.      Under similar circumstances, we have found this sort\n\nof   vaguely       articulated         prejudice     to        be    insufficient:\n\n\"[Appellant's] bare allegation that, if the jury were to believe\n\nthat he was involved in one bank robbery, then it might also\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f(improperly) be led to believe from that fact alone that he was\n\ninvolved in the other, is simply not enough.\"       United States v.\n\nTaylor, 54 F.3d 967, 973 (1st Cir. 1995).           Although    Taylor\n\ninvolved a defendant prosecuted for       two counts of bank robbery\n\nfor two separate incidents, while Burgos was prosecuted for two\n\nseparate crimes arising from the same incident, the reasoning of\n\nTaylor applies with equal force here.\n\n           Moreover, as the district court noted in its written\n\nmemorandum and order denying Burgos's motion for severance,\n\nproof of the two charges necessarily involved proof of much the\n\nsame conduct.    Count two of the indictment, charging money\n\nlaundering,   charged   that   the   \"specified   unlawful   activity\"\n\ninvolved in the transaction was the attempted distribution of\n\ncocaine.   Therefore, to convict Burgos of money laundering, the\n\ngovernment had to prove that he had attempted to distribute\n\ncocaine to satisfy the \"specified unlawful activity\" element of\n\nthe crime.    See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) (criminalizing\n\nattempting to conduct a financial transaction \"which in fact\n\ninvolves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity . . . with\n\nthe intent to promote the carrying on of          specified unlawful\n\nactivity\") (emphasis added).         Furthermore, proof of the drug\n\ncharge required an explanation of the agreed-upon purchase price\n\nfor the cocaine, as well as a description of the cash Burgos was\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fcarrying at the time of his arrest.             Because proof of the two\n\ncharges   involved    some   of    the   same   evidence    and    the   same\n\nwitnesses,    and   Burgos   did   not   make   an   adequate     showing   of\n\nprejudice from joinder of the two counts, the district court was\n\nwell within its discretion in denying the motion to sever.\n\n            Burgos makes one final argument on the severance issue.\n\nThe   government     introduced     substantial      evidence      at    trial\n\nconcerning Burgos's assets, earnings, and expenditures.                   Bank\n\nrecords indicated that Burgos made deposits into his checking\n\naccount during the years 1996 to 1999 that far exceeded the\n\nmodest wages earned by Burgos and his wife.                Other evidence,\n\nincluding    receipts,   showed     that   Burgos    had   also    purchased\n\nexpensive jewelry, cars, and a vacation.             He claims that this\n\nevidence regarding his financial condition would not have been\n\nadmissible at a trial of only the drug charge because Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 404(b) would have prevented the government from\n\nintroducing such evidence if it tended only to prove his bad\n\ncharacter.\n\n            That evidentiary rule provides:\n\n            Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is\n            not admissible to prove the character of a\n            person in order to show action in conformity\n            therewith. It may, however, be admissible\n            for other purposes, such as proof of motive,\n            opportunity,   intent,  preparation,   plan,\n            knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake\n            or accident.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fFed. R. Evid. 404(b) (emphasis added).               The evidence of Burgos's\n\nfinancial condition was admissible to prove the government's\n\ncase on the drug charge under this \"other purposes\" prong of\n\nRule 404(b).        Evidence of large sums of unexplained cash is\n\nrelevant to demonstrating an individual's involvement in illegal\n\ndrug activities.      See United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d 1446,\n\n1454 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Newton, 891 F.2d 944, 948\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).       Moreover, Burgos's history of trafficking in\n\nnarcotics was probative of his knowledge and intent in arranging\n\nthe transaction with O'Neil.           See United States v. Spinosa, 982\n\nF.2d 620, 628 (1st Cir. 1992) (approving admission of evidence\n\nof    past   drug   crimes    as    \"probative       of    the    fact    that    [the\n\ndefendant] was not merely an innocent driver who was involved in\n\nthe transaction by accident\"); United States v. Hadfield, 918\n\nF.2d   987,   994   (1st     Cir.    1990)    (\"We    have    often      upheld   the\n\nadmission of evidence of prior narcotics involvement in drug\n\ntrafficking cases to prove knowledge and intent.\").                       Given this\n\nprobative value of the evidence, it was admissible so long as\n\nits probative value was not \"substantially outweighed\" by the\n\nrisk of prejudice.         Fed. R. Evid. 403.             See also Hadfield, 918\n\nF.2d at 995 (affirming admission of past criminality where such\n\nevidence \"was prejudicial - but not unduly so\").                         We defer to\n\nthe    district     court's        calculation       of     the    probative      and\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fprejudicial value of this evidence.                \"Only rarely - and in\n\nextraordinarily compelling circumstances - will we, from the\n\nvista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-\n\nthe-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative\n\nvalue and unfair effect.\"         Freeman v. Package Machinery Co., 865\n\nF.2d       1331,   1340   (1st   Cir.    1988).        This   is   not    such    a\n\ncircumstance.4\n\n                    V. Violation of the Speedy Trial Act\n\n              Burgos argues that his rights under the Speedy Trial\n\nAct, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(b), were violated because he was not\n\nindicted on the money laundering charge until June 17, 1999,\n\nmore than four months after his arrest on the cocaine charge in\n\nFebruary.          The Speedy Trial Act (\"the Act\") provides: \"Any\n\ninformation        or   indictment   charging     an    individual       with   the\n\ncommission of an offense shall be filed within thirty days from\n\nthe date on which such individual was arrested or served with a\n\nsummons in connection with such charges.\"                18 U.S.C. § 3161(b)\n\n(emphasis added).         The purpose of this rule \"is to ensure that\n\n\n       4\n       Even if, as Burgos argues, the evidence of his financial\ncondition had been admissible only on the money laundering\ncharge, that would not have been a basis for mandatory\nseverance. See, e.g., United States v. Neal, 36 F.3d 1190, 1207\n(1st Cir. 1994) (noting that \"[t]rial courts are granted\ndiscretion under Rule 14 to take whatever steps are deemed\nnecessary to minimize prejudice\" and affirming district court's\ndenial of motion to sever where the district court instead chose\nto minimize the jury's exposure to the challenged evidence).\n\n                                        -15-\n\fthe   defendant     is    not   held   under    an    arrest   warrant      for    an\n\nexcessive period without receiving formal notice of the charge\n\nagainst which he must prepare to defend himself.\"                  United States\n\nv. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 200 (1st Cir. 1997) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n            As    the    government     argues       persuasively,    the    plain\n\nwording of the Act does not apply here.                 The Act imposes a 30-\n\nday time limit between an arrest and an indictment only where\n\nthe   arrest     was     \"in    connection     with\"    the    charges     in     the\n\nindictment.      18 U.S.C. § 3161(b).           Burgos was arrested on the\n\ncocaine charge and does not dispute that he was indicted for\n\nthat charge within the 30-day period prescribed by the Act.\n\nThus, the money laundering count in the superseding indictment\n\ndid not charge him with the crime for which he was arrested.\n\nUnder these circumstances, there is no violation of the Act.\n\nSee, e.g., Meade, 110 F.3d at 201 (finding no violation of the\n\nAct   because     the    prosecution      at   issue,     commenced      with      an\n\nindictment instead of an arrest, \"simply did not trigger §\n\n3161(b)'s    arrest-to-indictment         limitation\");        Acha   v.    United\n\nStates, 910 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1990) (finding no violation of\n\nthe Act and noting, \"'[t]he right to a speedy trial on a charge\n\nis triggered by arrest only where the arrest is the beginning of\n\ncontinuing       restraints      on    defendant's       liberty     imposed       in\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fconnection    with   the    formal    charge      on   which    defendant    is\n\neventually tried.'\") (quoting United States v. Stead, 745 F.2d\n\n1170, 1172 (8th Cir. 1984)); United States v. Heldt, 745 F.2d\n\n1275, 1280 (9th Cir. 1984).\n\n                             VI. Sentencing\n\n            Finally, Burgos argues that the district court erred\n\nin sentencing him to 108 months in prison in the absence of a\n\njury finding as to the quantity of cocaine he attempted to\n\npossess.     He points to the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), to support this\n\nclaim.     Burgos says that \"no detectable amount of cocaine was\n\nproven at trial\" because O'Neil did not actually have cocaine in\n\nhis possession when he met Burgos to complete their agreed-upon\n\ntransaction.     Thus, Burgos argues, the relevant quantity of\n\ncocaine for purposes of sentencing should be zero kilograms, not\n\ntwo kilograms as the district court found.              Because Burgos did\n\nnot argue this claim below, we review for plain error.                      See\n\nMojica-Baez, 229 F.3d at 307.            Finding no Apprendi error, we\n\naffirm.\n\n            Burgos   does   not   have      a   successful     Apprendi   claim\n\nbecause his sentence of 108 months falls within the 20-year\n\nmaximum sentence for the crime he committed.                 21 U.S.C. § 846\n\nprovides for the same penalties for an attempt or conspiracy to\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fpossess cocaine as for the substantive offense.         Accordingly, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C), which sets a maximum sentence of 20\n\nyears, is the relevant statute for the sentence Burgos received.\n\nBurgos's sentence of 108 months does not even approach this\n\nstatutory maximum for two kilograms of cocaine, a fact that\n\nBurgos concedes in his brief.        Thus, Apprendi does not apply.\n\nSee United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 41 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(\"[W]e   hold   that    no   constitutional    error   occurs   when   the\n\ndistrict court sentences the defendant within the statutory\n\nmaximum, regardless that drug quantity was never determined by\n\nthe jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\").\n\n\n\n\n                             VII. Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons we have explained, we discern no error\n\nin the proceedings below.        We affirm Burgos's convictions and\n\nsentence.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\f",

He makes five arguments: (1) that the indictment is defective for not sufficiently alleging proof that the money laundering transaction affected interstate commerce; (2) that the evidence was insufficient to convict him on both charges; (3) that the district court abused its discretion in not severing the two charges; (4) that the government violated the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161(b), in charging him with money laundering; and (5) that the district court erred in sentencing him on the cocaine conviction. For the reasons that follow, we affirm his convictions on both counts, as well as his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case against Burgos originated with the arrest of William O'Neil on February 10, 1999 by the Drug Enforcement Administration. Agreeing to cooperate with the government that same day, O'Neil arranged with Burgos, in a recorded telephone call, for Burgos to purchase two kilograms of cocaine at a price of $22,000 per kilogram. When Burgos arrived at the designated meeting place for the transaction, he was arrested immediately. Burgos had not yet obtained the cocaine from O'Neil at the time of his arrest and he had not yet had the opportunity to observe whether O'Neil was in possession of any cocaine. Burgos was carrying $44,000 in cash when he was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury returned an indictment on February 25, 1999 charging Burgos with attempting to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. After further investigation, the government obtained a search warrant for Burgos's residence, which it executed on March 9. Various documents, including financial and employment records, were seized at that time. Based on those records, a superseding indictment was returned on June 17 charging Burgos with money laundering and renewing the drug charge. Following a three-day trial, a jury convicted him of both counts on August 18, 1999. The district court sentenced Burgos in January 2000 to 108 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. Allegations of Interstate Commerce in the Indictment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos argues that the indictment contained insufficient allegations that his monetary transaction affected interstate commerce. Because he did not raise this claim below, we review for plain error. See United States v. Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292, 307 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The indictment charged that Burgos:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">did knowingly and willfully conduct and attempt to conduct a financial transaction, to wit, the delivery of $44,000 in cash, which said cash involved the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity, that is, the distribution of a controlled substance, a violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 841(a)(1), with the intent to promote the carrying on of a specified unlawful activity, to wit, the distribution of cocaine, a violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 841(a)(1), and that while conducting and attempting to conduct such financial transaction knew that the cash represented the proceeds of unlawful activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the indictment does not allege specifically that the transaction affected interstate commerce. However, \"financial transaction\" is defined as \"a transaction which in any way or degree affects interstate or foreign commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(c)(4)(A). Moreover, the indictment specifically alleged that the financial transaction at issue was Burgos's attempt to purchase cocaine for $44,000. It is well-settled that drug trafficking is an activity that affects interstate commerce. See United States v. Zorilla, 93 F.3d 7, 8 (1st Cir. 1996); see also United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 755 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d 9, 21 (1st Cir. 1997). We conclude, therefore, that the indictment sufficiently alleged interstate commerce as an element of the crime, and that Burgos was on notice of that element. Cf. United States v. Cefaratti, 221 F.3d 502, 507 (3d Cir. 2000) (\"[A]n indictment that charges a legal term of art sufficiently charges the component parts of that term.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Kovach, 208 F.3d 1215, 1219 (10th Cir. 2000) (finding that the indictment adequately charged the interstate commerce element by using the word \"organization,\" a term of art defined by statute as an entity that affects interstate commerce); United States v. Wicks, 187 F.3d 426, 428 (4th Cir. 1999) (same). Indeed, Burgos does not claim in his brief that he lacked notice of this element. Moreover, even assuming that the charging language was in error, Burgos has not even attempted to show the prejudice required by the plain error standard. See United States v. Balgyga, 233 F.3d 674, 682 (1st Cir. 2000). Thus, we reject Burgos's claim that his conviction should be reversed because of an error in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing Burgos's challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine whether the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution supports the guilty verdicts. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Attempt to Possess with Intent to Distribute Cocaine</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos was convicted of attempting to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> He argues that a rational jury could not have convicted him because there was no actual cocaine involved in the transaction between him and O'Neil. The government concedes that Burgos was arrested before he came into possession of any cocaine, and that O'Neil did not have any cocaine with him when he met Burgos to complete the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Burgos's assertion, neither O'Neil nor Burgos had to possess cocaine at the time of the contemplated transaction to satisfy the elements of this crime. \"To prove attempt, the government must establish both an intent to commit the substantive offense and a substantial step towards its commission.\" United States v. Argencourt, 996 F.2d 1300, 1303 (1st Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). The step towards completion of the crime \"must be more than mere preparation.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Nonetheless, an individual accused of attempt to possess cocaine \"does not have to get very far along the line toward ultimate commission of the object crime in order to commit the attempt offense.\" United States v. Doyon, 194 F.3d 207, 211 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rational jury could have found easily that Burgos demonstrated an intent to commit the substantive offense of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it. Law enforcement officers testified that Burgos arranged the transaction with O'Neil over the course of six telephone calls. Shortly before the agreed-upon meeting time, surveillance officers observed Burgos leave his home in a car, closely followed by an individual in another car. The drug agents testified that the presence of this second car was consistent with the practice of bringing security to a narcotics transaction. The officers then observed Burgos arrive at the location that he and O'Neil had specified carrying $44,000 in cash, a sum corresponding to the price and quantity of cocaine he had agreed to purchase - two kilograms at $22,000 each. Burgos approached O'Neil and was immediately arrested. This evidence establishes Burgos's criminal intent and further constitutes a substantial step towards commission of the substantive offense of possessing cocaine. Whether he or O'Neil did in fact possess cocaine at some point during the transaction is irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Money Laundering</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos was convicted of money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> He claims that the government failed to prove that his attempt to exchange $44,000 in cash for two kilograms of cocaine had a sufficient link to interstate commerce. As we have already noted, section 1956 defines \"financial transaction\" as \"a transaction which in any way or degree affects interstate or foreign commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(c)(4)(A) (emphasis added). In interpreting this provision, we have held that \"[a] minimal effect on interstate commerce is sufficient to support a conviction.\" Owens, 167 F.3d at 755.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons we have already discussed, a rational jury could have found that Burgos attempted to purchase two kilograms of cocaine for $44,000 cash. The government presented additional evidence from which a jury could have inferred that the cash was derived from Burgos's involvement in trafficking narcotics. For example, financial and employment records seized during a search of Burgos's home indicated that his family's expenditures far exceeded the legitimate income produced by him and his wife. Plastic bags containing marijuana residue were also found during the search. Government witnesses further testified that O'Neil told Burgos when they arranged the transaction that the person delivering the cocaine to O'Neil had just arrived from New York and was impatient to return there. Therefore, the facts of the transaction as Burgos believed them to be establish the element of interstate commerce. See United States v. Dworken, 855 F.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating that a person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, \"under the circumstances as he believes them to be,\" the act is a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in a crime (quoting American Law Institute, Model Penal Code &#167;&#167; 5.01(1)(c)(1985))). Additional evidence indicated that most of the cocaine in the area of Springfield, Massachusetts at the time of Burgos's arrest came from New York, and that both the cocaine and the money used to purchase it would thus be likely to travel across state lines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a well-settled proposition that \"drug trafficking is precisely the kind of economic enterprise that substantially affects interstate commerce.\" Zorilla, 93 F.3d at 8. We have held in other cases that involvement in the drug trade satisfies the \"effect on interstate commerce\" prong of the money laundering statute. See, e.g., Owens, 167 F.3d at 755 (affirming the conviction where there was evidence that the money involved in the transaction was generated by a drug enterprise transporting cocaine and cash between Providence and Boston); Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d at 21 (affirming conviction under &#167;&#167; 1956 where the jury could have inferred that the defendant engaged in telephone conversations that were part of illegal drug activity and not a legitimate business). Therefore, we reject Burgos's claim that there was insufficient proof of a link between his attempted financial transaction and interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Severance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Burgos's motion to sever the two counts of the superseding indictment in a written memorandum and order. We review that determination for manifest abuse of discretion. See United States v. DeLeon, 187 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14 provides: \"If it appears that a defendant or the government is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment or information or by such joinder for trial together, the court may order an election or separate trials of counts, grant a severance of defendants or provide whatever other relief justice requires.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 14 (emphasis added). We will overturn a court's exercise of its discretion in considering a motion for severance \"only upon a demonstration of manifest abuse.\" United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 246 (1st Cir. 1990). \"This is a difficult battle for a defendant to win. There is always some prejudice in any trial where more than one offense or offender are tried together - but such 'garden variety' prejudice, in and of itself, will not suffice.\" Id. Burgos must demonstrate that the allegedly improper joinder \"likely deprived [him] of a fair trial.\" United States v. Bartelho, 129 F.3d 663, 678 (1st Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Burgos's claim falls far short of this standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos argues that the jury may have been improperly led to convict him of both charges because the evidence relating to one charge tended to prove that he was of bad character generally. Under similar circumstances, we have found this sort of vaguely articulated prejudice to be insufficient: \"[Appellant's] bare allegation that, if the jury were to believe that he was involved in one bank robbery, then it might also (improperly) be led to believe from that fact alone that he was involved in the other, is simply not enough.\" United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 973 (1st Cir. 1995). Although Taylor involved a defendant prosecuted for two counts of bank robbery for two separate incidents, while Burgos was prosecuted for two separate crimes arising from the same incident, the reasoning of Taylor applies with equal force here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as the district court noted in its written memorandum and order denying Burgos's motion for severance, proof of the two charges necessarily involved proof of much the same conduct. Count two of the indictment, charging money laundering, charged that the \"specified unlawful activity\" involved in the transaction was the attempted distribution of cocaine. Therefore, to convict Burgos of money laundering, the government had to prove that he had attempted to distribute cocaine to satisfy the \"specified unlawful activity\" element of the crime. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) (criminalizing attempting to conduct a financial transaction \"which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity . . . with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\") (emphasis added). Furthermore, proof of the drug charge required an explanation of the agreed-upon purchase price for the cocaine, as well as a description of the cash Burgos was carrying at the time of his arrest. Because proof of the two charges involved some of the same evidence and the same witnesses, and Burgos did not make an adequate showing of prejudice from joinder of the two counts, the district court was well within its discretion in denying the motion to sever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos makes one final argument on the severance issue. The government introduced substantial evidence at trial concerning Burgos's assets, earnings, and expenditures. Bank records indicated that Burgos made deposits into his checking account during the years 1996 to 1999 that far exceeded the modest wages earned by Burgos and his wife. Other evidence, including receipts, showed that Burgos had also purchased expensive jewelry, cars, and a vacation. He claims that this evidence regarding his financial condition would not have been admissible at a trial of only the drug charge because Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) would have prevented the government from introducing such evidence if it tended only to prove his bad character.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">That evidentiary rule provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) (emphasis added). The evidence of Burgos's financial condition was admissible to prove the government's case on the drug charge under this \"other purposes\" prong of Rule 404(b). Evidence of large sums of unexplained cash is relevant to demonstrating an individual's involvement in illegal drug activities. See United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d 1446, 1454 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Newton, 891 F.2d 944, 948 (1st Cir. 1989). Moreover, Burgos's history of trafficking in narcotics was probative of his knowledge and intent in arranging the transaction with O'Neil. See United States v. Spinosa, 982 F.2d 620, 628 (1st Cir. 1992) (approving admission of evidence of past drug crimes as \"probative of the fact that [the defendant] was not merely an innocent driver who was involved in the transaction by accident\"); United States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 994 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"We have often upheld the admission of evidence of prior narcotics involvement in drug trafficking cases to prove knowledge and intent.\"). Given this probative value of the evidence, it was admissible so long as its probative value was not \"substantially outweighed\" by the risk of prejudice. Fed. R. Evid. 403. See also Hadfield, 918 F.2d at 995 (affirming admission of past criminality where such evidence \"was prejudicial - but not unduly so\"). We defer to the district court's calculation of the probative and prejudicial value of this evidence. \"Only rarely - and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances - will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" Freeman v. Package Machinery Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988). This is not such a circumstance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Violation of the Speedy Trial Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos argues that his rights under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161(b), were violated because he was not indicted on the money laundering charge until June 17, 1999, more than four months after his arrest on the cocaine charge in February. The Speedy Trial Act (\"the Act\") provides: \"Any information or indictment charging an individual with the commission of an offense shall be filed within thirty days from the date on which such individual was arrested or served with a summons in connection with such charges.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161(b) (emphasis added). The purpose of this rule \"is to ensure that the defendant is not held under an arrest warrant for an excessive period without receiving formal notice of the charge against which he must prepare to defend himself.\" United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 200 (1st Cir. 1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government argues persuasively, the plain wording of the Act does not apply here. The Act imposes a 30-day time limit between an arrest and an indictment only where the arrest was \"in connection with\" the charges in the indictment. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161(b). Burgos was arrested on the cocaine charge and does not dispute that he was indicted for that charge within the 30-day period prescribed by the Act. Thus, the money laundering count in the superseding indictment did not charge him with the crime for which he was arrested. Under these circumstances, there is no violation of the Act. See, e.g., Meade, 110 F.3d at 201 (finding no violation of the Act because the prosecution at issue, commenced with an indictment instead of an arrest, \"simply did not trigger &#167;&#167; 3161(b)'s arrest-to-indictment limitation\"); Acha v. United States, 910 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1990) (finding no violation of the Act and noting, \"'[t]he right to a speedy trial on a charge is triggered by arrest only where the arrest is the beginning of continuing restraints on defendant's liberty imposed in connection with the formal charge on which defendant is eventually tried.'\") (quoting United States v. Stead, 745 F.2d 1170, 1172 (8th Cir. 1984)); United States v. Heldt, 745 F.2d 1275, 1280 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Burgos argues that the district court erred in sentencing him to 108 months in prison in the absence of a jury finding as to the quantity of cocaine he attempted to possess. He points to the Supreme Court's recent decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), to support this claim. Burgos says that \"no detectable amount of cocaine was proven at trial\" because O'Neil did not actually have cocaine in his possession when he met Burgos to complete their agreed- upon transaction. Thus, Burgos argues, the relevant quantity of cocaine for purposes of sentencing should be zero kilograms, not two kilograms as the district court found. Because Burgos did not argue this claim below, we review for plain error. See Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d at 307. Finding no Apprendi error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos does not have a successful Apprendi claim because his sentence of 108 months falls within the 20-year maximum sentence for the crime he committed. 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846 provides for the same penalties for an attempt or conspiracy to possess cocaine as for the substantive offense. Accordingly, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(b)(1)(C), which sets a maximum sentence of 20 years, is the relevant statute for the sentence Burgos received. Burgos's sentence of 108 months does not even approach this statutory maximum for two kilograms of cocaine, a fact that Burgos concedes in his brief. Thus, Apprendi does not apply. See United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 41 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[W]e hold that no constitutional error occurs when the district court sentences the defendant within the statutory maximum, regardless that drug quantity was never determined by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VII.

He makes five arguments: (1) that the indictment is defective for not sufficiently alleging proof that the money laundering transaction affected interstate commerce; (2) that the evidence was insufficient to convict him on both charges; (3) that the district court abused its discretion in not severing the two charges; (4) that the government violated the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161(b), in charging him with money laundering; and (5) that the district court erred in sentencing him on the cocaine conviction. For the reasons that follow, we affirm his convictions on both counts, as well as his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case against Burgos originated with the arrest of William O'Neil on February 10, 1999 by the Drug Enforcement Administration. Agreeing to cooperate with the government that same day, O'Neil arranged with Burgos, in a recorded telephone call, for Burgos to purchase two kilograms of cocaine at a price of $22,000 per kilogram. When Burgos arrived at the designated meeting place for the transaction, he was arrested immediately. Burgos had not yet obtained the cocaine from O'Neil at the time of his arrest and he had not yet had the opportunity to observe whether O'Neil was in possession of any cocaine. Burgos was carrying $44,000 in cash when he was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury returned an indictment on February 25, 1999 charging Burgos with attempting to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. After further investigation, the government obtained a search warrant for Burgos's residence, which it executed on March 9. Various documents, including financial and employment records, were seized at that time. Based on those records, a superseding indictment was returned on June 17 charging Burgos with money laundering and renewing the drug charge. Following a three-day trial, a jury convicted him of both counts on August 18, 1999. The district court sentenced Burgos in January 2000 to 108 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. Allegations of Interstate Commerce in the Indictment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos argues that the indictment contained insufficient allegations that his monetary transaction affected interstate commerce. Because he did not raise this claim below, we review for plain error. See United States v. Mojica-Baez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770724\"><a href=\"/opinion/770724/united-states-v-john-alexis-mojica-baez-united-states-of-america-v-josue/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 307 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The indictment charged that Burgos:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">did knowingly and willfully conduct and attempt to conduct a financial transaction, to wit, the delivery of $44,000 in cash, which said cash involved the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity, that is, the distribution of a controlled substance, a violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 841(a)(1), with the intent to promote the carrying on of a specified unlawful activity, to wit, the distribution of cocaine, a violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 841(a)(1), and that while conducting and attempting to conduct such financial transaction knew that the cash represented the proceeds of unlawful activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the indictment does not allege specifically that the transaction affected interstate commerce. However, \"financial transaction\" is defined as \"a transaction which in any way or degree affects interstate or foreign commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(c)(4)(A). Moreover, the indictment specifically alleged that the financial transaction at issue was Burgos's attempt to purchase cocaine for $44,000. It is well-settled that drug trafficking is an activity that affects interstate commerce. See United States v. Zorilla, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196925\"><a href=\"/opinion/196925/united-states-v-zorrilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1996); see also United States v.

We conclude, therefore, that the indictment sufficiently alleged interstate commerce as an element of the crime, and that Burgos was on notice of that element. Cf. United States v. Cefaratti, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769761\"><a href=\"/opinion/769761/united-states-v-frank-cefaratti/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 507 (3d Cir. 2000) (\"[A]n indictment that charges a legal term of art sufficiently charges the component parts of that term.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v.

Wicks, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765638\"><a href=\"/opinion/765638/united-states-v-david-bryant-wicks-jr-aka-david-bryant-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, 428 (4th Cir. 1999) (same). Indeed, Burgos does not claim in his brief that he lacked notice of this element. Moreover, even assuming that the charging language was in error, Burgos has not even attempted to show the prejudice required by the plain error standard. See United States v. Balgyga, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199179\"><a href=\"/opinion/199179/united-states-v-baldyga/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span>, 682 (1st Cir. 2000). Thus, we reject Burgos's claim that his conviction should be reversed because of an error in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing Burgos's challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine whether the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution supports the guilty verdicts.

The step towards completion of the crime \"must be more than mere preparation.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Nonetheless, an individual accused of attempt to possess cocaine \"does not have to get very far along the line toward ultimate commission of the object crime in order to commit the attempt offense.\" United States v. Doyon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198684\"><a href=\"/opinion/198684/united-states-v-doyon/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span>, 211 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rational jury could have found easily that Burgos demonstrated an intent to commit the substantive offense of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it. Law enforcement officers testified that Burgos arranged the transaction with O'Neil over the course of six telephone calls. Shortly before the agreed-upon meeting time, surveillance officers observed Burgos leave his home in a car, closely followed by an individual in another car. The drug agents testified that the presence of this second car was consistent with the practice of bringing security to a narcotics transaction. The officers then observed Burgos arrive at the location that he and O'Neil had specified carrying $44,000 in cash, a sum corresponding to the price and quantity of cocaine he had agreed to purchase - two kilograms at $22,000 each. Burgos approached O'Neil and was immediately arrested. This evidence establishes Burgos's criminal intent and further constitutes a substantial step towards commission of the substantive offense of possessing cocaine. Whether he or O'Neil did in fact possess cocaine at some point during the transaction is irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

As we have already noted, section 1956 defines \"financial transaction\" as \"a transaction which in any way or degree affects interstate or foreign commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(c)(4)(A) (emphasis added). In interpreting this provision, we have held that \"[a] minimal effect on interstate commerce is sufficient to support a conviction.\" Owens, 167 F.3d at 755.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons we have already discussed, a rational jury could have found that Burgos attempted to purchase two kilograms of cocaine for $44,000 cash. The government presented additional evidence from which a jury could have inferred that the cash was derived from Burgos's involvement in trafficking narcotics. For example, financial and employment records seized during a search of Burgos's home indicated that his family's expenditures far exceeded the legitimate income produced by him and his wife. Plastic bags containing marijuana residue were also found during the search. Government witnesses further testified that O'Neil told Burgos when they arranged the transaction that the person delivering the cocaine to O'Neil had just arrived from New York and was impatient to return there. Therefore, the facts of the transaction as Burgos believed them to be establish the element of interstate commerce. See United States v. Dworken, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510631\"><a href=\"/opinion/510631/united-states-v-jay-lewis-dworken-aka-jason-lewis-jay-lewis-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating that a person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, \"under the circumstances as he believes them to be,\" the act is a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in a crime (quoting American Law Institute, Model Penal Code &#167;&#167; 5.01(1)(c)(1985))). Additional evidence indicated that most of the cocaine in the area of Springfield, Massachusetts at the time of Burgos's arrest came from New York, and that both the cocaine and the money used to purchase it would thus be likely to travel across state lines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a well-settled proposition that \"drug trafficking is precisely the kind of economic enterprise that substantially affects interstate commerce.\" Zorilla, 93 F.3d at 8. We have held in other cases that involvement in the drug trade satisfies the \"effect on interstate commerce\" prong of the money laundering statute. See, e.g., Owens, 167 F.3d at 755 (affirming the conviction where there was evidence that the money involved in the transaction was generated by a drug enterprise transporting cocaine and cash between Providence and Boston); Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d at 21 (affirming conviction under &#167;&#167; 1956 where the jury could have inferred that the defendant engaged in telephone conversations that were part of illegal drug activity and not a legitimate business). Therefore, we reject Burgos's claim that there was insufficient proof of a link between his attempted financial transaction and interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Severance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Burgos's motion to sever the two counts of the superseding indictment in a written memorandum and order. We review that determination for manifest abuse of discretion. See United States v. DeLeon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198562\"><a href=\"/opinion/198562/united-states-v-deleon/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14 provides: \"If it appears that a defendant or the government is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment or information or by such joinder for trial together, the court may order an election or separate trials of counts, grant a severance of defendants or provide whatever other relief justice requires.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 14 (emphasis added). We will overturn a court's exercise of its discretion in considering a motion for severance \"only upon a demonstration of manifest abuse.\" United States v. Boylan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 246 (1st Cir. 1990). \"This is a difficult battle for a defendant to win. There is always some prejudice in any trial where more than one offense or offender are tried together - but such 'garden variety' prejudice, in and of itself, will not suffice.\" Id. Burgos must demonstrate that the allegedly improper joinder \"likely deprived [him] of a fair trial.\" United States v. Bartelho, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197664\"><a href=\"/opinion/197664/united-states-v-bartelho/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span>, 678 (1st Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Burgos's claim falls far short of this standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos argues that the jury may have been improperly led to convict him of both charges because the evidence relating to one charge tended to prove that he was of bad character generally. Under similar circumstances, we have found this sort of vaguely articulated prejudice to be insufficient: \"[Appellant's] bare allegation that, if the jury were to believe that he was involved in one bank robbery, then it might also (improperly) be led to believe from that fact alone that he was involved in the other, is simply not enough.\" United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 973 (1st Cir. 1995). Although Taylor involved a defendant prosecuted for two counts of bank robbery for two separate incidents, while Burgos was prosecuted for two separate crimes arising from the same incident, the reasoning of Taylor applies with equal force here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as the district court noted in its written memorandum and order denying Burgos's motion for severance, proof of the two charges necessarily involved proof of much the same conduct. Count two of the indictment, charging money laundering, charged that the \"specified unlawful activity\" involved in the transaction was the attempted distribution of cocaine. Therefore, to convict Burgos of money laundering, the government had to prove that he had attempted to distribute cocaine to satisfy the \"specified unlawful activity\" element of the crime. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) (criminalizing attempting to conduct a financial transaction \"which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity . . . with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\") (emphasis added). Furthermore, proof of the drug charge required an explanation of the agreed-upon purchase price for the cocaine, as well as a description of the cash Burgos was carrying at the time of his arrest. Because proof of the two charges involved some of the same evidence and the same witnesses, and Burgos did not make an adequate showing of prejudice from joinder of the two counts, the district court was well within its discretion in denying the motion to sever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos makes one final argument on the severance issue. The government introduced substantial evidence at trial concerning Burgos's assets, earnings, and expenditures. Bank records indicated that Burgos made deposits into his checking account during the years 1996 to 1999 that far exceeded the modest wages earned by Burgos and his wife. Other evidence, including receipts, showed that Burgos had also purchased expensive jewelry, cars, and a vacation. He claims that this evidence regarding his financial condition would not have been admissible at a trial of only the drug charge because Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) would have prevented the government from introducing such evidence if it tended only to prove his bad character.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">That evidentiary rule provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) (emphasis added). The evidence of Burgos's financial condition was admissible to prove the government's case on the drug charge under this \"other purposes\" prong of Rule 404(b). Evidence of large sums of unexplained cash is relevant to demonstrating an individual's involvement in illegal drug activities. See United States v. Figueroa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592204\"><a href=\"/opinion/592204/united-states-v-angel-luis-figueroa-united-states-of-america-v-tomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1454 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v.

Moreover, Burgos's history of trafficking in narcotics was probative of his knowledge and intent in arranging the transaction with O'Neil. See United States v. Spinosa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597409\"><a href=\"/opinion/597409/united-states-v-vincent-d-spinosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span>, 628 (1st Cir. 1992) (approving admission of evidence of past drug crimes as \"probative of the fact that [the defendant] was not merely an innocent driver who was involved in the transaction by accident\"); United States v. Hadfield, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551471\"><a href=\"/opinion/551471/united-states-v-royal-w-hadfield-jr-united-states-of-america-v-helen/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span>, 994 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"We have often upheld the admission of evidence of prior narcotics involvement in drug trafficking cases to prove knowledge and intent.\"). Given this probative value of the evidence, it was admissible so long as its probative value was not \"substantially outweighed\" by the risk of prejudice. Fed. R. Evid. 403. See also Hadfield, 918 F.2d at 995 (affirming admission of past criminality where such evidence \"was prejudicial - but not unduly so\"). We defer to the district court's calculation of the probative and prejudicial value of this evidence. \"Only rarely - and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances - will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" Freeman v. Package Machinery Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517427\"><a href=\"/opinion/517427/49-fair-emplpraccas-1139-48-empl-prac-dec-p-38456-27-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988). This is not such a circumstance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Violation of the Speedy Trial Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos argues that his rights under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161(b), were violated because he was not indicted on the money laundering charge until June 17, 1999, more than four months after his arrest on the cocaine charge in February. The Speedy Trial Act (\"the Act\") provides: \"Any information or indictment charging an individual with the commission of an offense shall be filed within thirty days from the date on which such individual was arrested or served with a summons in connection with such charges.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161(b) (emphasis added). The purpose of this rule \"is to ensure that the defendant is not held under an arrest warrant for an excessive period without receiving formal notice of the charge against which he must prepare to defend himself.\" United States v. Meade, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197292\"><a href=\"/opinion/197292/united-states-v-meade/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span>, 200 (1st Cir. 1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government argues persuasively, the plain wording of the Act does not apply here. The Act imposes a 30-day time limit between an arrest and an indictment only where the arrest was \"in connection with\" the charges in the indictment. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161(b). Burgos was arrested on the cocaine charge and does not dispute that he was indicted for that charge within the 30-day period prescribed by the Act. Thus, the money laundering count in the superseding indictment did not charge him with the crime for which he was arrested. Under these circumstances, there is no violation of the Act. See, e.g., Meade, 110 F.3d at 201 (finding no violation of the Act because the prosecution at issue, commenced with an indictment instead of an arrest, \"simply did not trigger &#167;&#167; 3161(b)'s arrest-to-indictment limitation\"); Acha v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546072\"><a href=\"/opinion/546072/jose-rosado-acha-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir. 1990) (finding no violation of the Act and noting, \"'[t]he right to a speedy trial on a charge is triggered by arrest only where the arrest is the beginning of continuing restraints on defendant's liberty imposed in connection with the formal charge on which defendant is eventually tried.'\") (quoting United States v. Stead, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442914\"><a href=\"/opinion/442914/united-states-v-larry-edward-stead/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1170</span></a></span>, 1172 (8th Cir. 1984)); United States v.

Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Burgos argues that the district court erred in sentencing him to 108 months in prison in the absence of a jury finding as to the quantity of cocaine he attempted to possess. He points to the Supreme Court's recent decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span> (2000), to support this claim. Burgos says that \"no detectable amount of cocaine was proven at trial\" because O'Neil did not actually have cocaine in his possession when he met Burgos to complete their agreed- upon transaction. Thus, Burgos argues, the relevant quantity of cocaine for purposes of sentencing should be zero kilograms, not two kilograms as the district court found. Because Burgos did not argue this claim below, we review for plain error. See Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d at 307. Finding no Apprendi error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos does not have a successful Apprendi claim because his sentence of 108 months falls within the 20-year maximum sentence for the crime he committed. 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846 provides for the same penalties for an attempt or conspiracy to possess cocaine as for the substantive offense. Accordingly, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(b)(1)(C), which sets a maximum sentence of 20 years, is the relevant statute for the sentence Burgos received. Burgos's sentence of 108 months does not even approach this statutory maximum for two kilograms of cocaine, a fact that Burgos concedes in his brief. Thus, Apprendi does not apply. See United States v. Baltas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199221\"><a href=\"/opinion/199221/united-states-v-baltas/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[W]e hold that no constitutional error occurs when the district court sentences the defendant within the statutory maximum, regardless that drug quantity was never determined by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VII. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons we have explained, we discern no error in the proceedings below.

Although Burgos was arrested before he completed the financial transaction in which he had planned to exchange cash for cocaine, &#167;&#167; 1956 applies to such attempted transactions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Even if, as Burgos argues, the evidence of his financial condition had been admissible only on the money laundering charge, that would not have been a basis for mandatory severance.
