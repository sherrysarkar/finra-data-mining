Hctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Francisco Rebollo-Casalduc, with whom Nachman, Guillemard &amp;\r\nRebollo, was on brief for appellant.\r\n\n   Louis M. Fischer, Attorney, United States Department of\r\nJustice, with whom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, was on\r\nbrief for appellee.\r\n\nMay 27, 1994\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  Defendant-appellant Jos\r\nLuis Lozada-Rivera (\"Lozada\") challenges his criminal conviction\r\nfor conspiracy to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine with\r\nintent to distribute.  He raises several issues on appeal,\r\nincluding asserted defects in the trial court's evidentiary rulings\r\nand its instructions to the jury.  We address only two of his\r\nweightiest claims:  that the trial judge erred in admitting into\r\nevidence a federal agent's report containing his version of\r\napparently incriminating statements made by defendant during a\r\npost-arrest interview; and that the court improperly permitted a\r\ngovernment witness to testify that Lozada had recently asked him to\r\nalter his testimony.  We reverse and remand for a new trial on both\r\nscores.  \r\nThe court should not have allowed the jury to consider\r\nthe contents of the report, either for the truth of the matter\r\nasserted therein or for a more limited rehabilitative purpose. \r\nAnd, as the government now concedes, the court should not have\r\npermitted testimony about Lozada's jailhouse remarks elicited in\r\nviolation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  We conclude\r\nthat neither of these errors was harmless.\r\n                              I\r\nOn February 19, 1997, a federal grand jury indicted\r\nLozada and three others on one count of conspiracy to traffic\r\ncocaine, 21 U.S.C.  846, and four counts of possession with intent\r\nto distribute,  21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1).  His fellow co-defendants\r\npled out before trial; Lozada opted to take his chances with a jury\r\nof his peers.\r\nDuring the course of his nine-day trial in September\r\n1997, the government introduced substantial evidence of a scheme to\r\ntransport several hundred kilograms of cocaine from Puerto Rico to\r\nthe New York metropolitan area.  The evidence established that the\r\ndrug trafficking operation, with a few minor variations, worked in\r\nthe following manner:  Members of a transportation group received\r\nthe cocaine from Colombian suppliers in Puerto Rico and delivered\r\nit to a warehouse owned by Lozada.  Once at the warehouse, they\r\nwould elaborately repackage the cocaine by concealing it in cargo\r\ncontainers containing corn oil, coconuts, syrup, and other food\r\nstuff.  The narcotics were then smuggled to New York masked as\r\nlegitimate products. \r\nJairo Rodrguez-Zuluaga (\"Rodrguez\"), who served as the\r\nliaison between the transportation group and the Colombian\r\nsuppliers, would usually assist in the repackaging process and then\r\ntravel to New York to receive the shipment.  The conspirators later\r\nmet in a hotel in New Jersey to be paid for their labor.  This\r\nentire process was repeated several times between 1994 and 1996. \r\nThe responsible parties transported some 100-800 kilograms of\r\ncocaine from Puerto Rico to New York in this fashion.\r\nThe government advanced a theory of the case according to\r\nwhich Lozada and Carlos Rosario-Matos (\"Rosario\") jointly headed\r\nthe transportation group and, after Rosario's arrest in 1995,\r\nLozada assumed full control of the unit.  As the government's\r\nwitnesses told it, for each shipment Lozada secured the necessary\r\ncargo containers, prepared the shipping paperwork (listing \"Loza\r\nFoods\" as the putative shipping company), and purchased the\r\nlegitimate items ultimately used to fill the containers and conceal\r\nthe cocaine.  Lozada operated Las Vegas Brands, Inc., a food\r\nproducts import-export company based in Puerto Rico, whose supplies\r\nand property were used for the repackaging activities of the\r\ntransportation group.  The prosecutor tendered other circumstantial\r\nevidence of Lozada's guilt:  he made certain suspiciously large\r\ncash deposits into his business account, kept sizeable sums of cash\r\nnearby, and made seemingly extravagant expenditures for a person of\r\nrelatively modest means.\r\nThree cooperating witnesses tied Lozada to the conspiracy\r\n(a fourth stated that he saw Lozada at a meeting where the elements\r\nof the scheme were discussed).  Rosario, who originally established\r\ncontact with the Colombian suppliers on his own, testified that\r\nLozada got involved after the first shipment, and that he\r\nthereafter shared half his profits from future shipments with\r\nLozada. \r\nRodrguez, the go-between, stated that he saw Lozada, who\r\nhe knew as \"Don Millin,\" present at repackaging sessions and that\r\nLozada showed up to get paid on at least one occasion.  Abelardo\r\nTorres-Padilla (\"Torres\"), too, placed Lozada in the general\r\nvicinity of the warehouse when the cocaine was being placed in the\r\ncontainers, and claimed that he informed Lozada by telephone that\r\na July 1995 shipment had been seized by Customs agents.  Over\r\nstrong objections by the defense, Torres also testified that the\r\nnight before he was to take the stand, Lozada offered him money if\r\nhe would change his testimony (the two were housed in the same\r\ndetention facility).  \r\nThe centerpiece evidence of Lozada's involvement in the\r\nconspiracy, however, were certain incriminating statements\r\nallegedly uttered by Lozada on the day of his arrest when he\r\ninitially opted to cooperate with the authorities.  The government\r\nurged the jury to view these comments purportedly made in the\r\npresence of federal law enforcement officers, including Drug\r\nEnforcement Agency (\"DEA\") Agent Rafael E. Rodrguez (\"Agent\r\nRodrguez\"), as a \"confession.\"  Agent Rodrguez was the only\r\nwitness to testify at trial that Lozada incriminated himself.  He\r\nwas cross-examined by the defense.  Then, at a critical juncture in\r\nthe proceedings and on redirect, the prosecution offered a detailed\r\ntypewritten report ostensibly to repair Agent Rodrguez's\r\ncredibility.  This report paraphrased a series of damaging\r\nstatements allegedly made by Lozada, thereby buttressing the\r\nagent's oral testimony.  Again over defendant's objections, the\r\ncourt accepted this evidence.  \r\nTaking the stand in his own defense, Lozada testified\r\nthat he had met some of the principals in the alleged conspiracy\r\nunder completely innocent circumstances.  He also acknowledged that\r\nhe sometimes allowed Rosario, his long-time friend, to use his\r\nwarehouse for storage space, but denied actively participating in\r\na drug trafficking conspiracy.  He vehemently denied making any\r\nincriminating statements to government agents after his arrest. \r\nHis nephew took the stand and said that he had, on occasion,\r\nprepared paperwork on Rosario's behalf using the shipping name\r\n\"Loza Foods.\"  Other witnesses attested to Lozada's reputation for\r\ntruth-telling.\r\nOn September 22, 1997, after a few hours of deliberation,\r\nthe jury convicted Lozada on all counts.  The court subsequently\r\nsentenced him to 210 months of imprisonment followed by five years\r\nof supervised release, after departing downward from the applicable\r\nsentencing guideline range based on his advanced age and\r\nsignificant physical ailments.  Lozada filed a timely appeal.\r\n                              II\r\nWe lead off with the issue of whether the trial court\r\nerred by accepting the DEA report into evidence.  During the\r\ngovernment's case-in-chief, Agent Rodrguez testified that Lozada\r\nmade certain incriminating comments during a post-arrest interview\r\non May 4, 1997.  According to Agent Rodrguez, Lozada admitted his\r\nrole in the conspiracy and explained his actions in furtherance of\r\nits objectives.\r\nDuring cross-examination, defense counsel established\r\nthat the interview had not been tape-recorded or videotaped.  He\r\nthen asked Agent Rodrguez to confirm that he had once lived in\r\nLozada's neighborhood and attended school with his children, and\r\ninquired whether he had anything against Lozada or his family. \r\nAgent Rodrguez answered in the negative, and counsel pressed no\r\nfurther.\r\nOn redirect, the government sought to introduce a formal\r\nreport prepared by Agent Rodrguez in which he recounted his\r\nversion of Lozada's alleged comments during the March 4, 1997\r\ninterview, to rebut what it believed to be a charge of improper\r\nmotive made during defense counsel's examination.  The DEA report\r\ncharacterized the discussion as marked by defendant's willingness\r\nto \"talk about the events that led to his involvement in drug\r\ntrafficking activities,\" and ascribed to Lozada certain admissions\r\nrevealing his awareness of crucial details of the drug trafficking\r\nring, including the method of smuggling the cocaine and his\r\nfamiliarity with key players in the scheme.  Agent Rodrguez\r\napparently completed the report a day or two after the actual\r\ninterview based on contemporaneous notes he had taken during the\r\nconversation, which have since been destroyed.  The government\r\nexplicitly \"offered [the report] under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)\" to\r\n\"rebut the attack on his credibility.\"\r\nDefense counsel objected, saying that the contents of the\r\nreport were overly prejudicial and constituted inadmissible\r\nhearsay.  The district court overruled defendant's objections and\r\nallowed the report into evidence, ruling that it was admissible to\r\nrebut Lozada's implied charge of improper motivation because\r\ncounsel \"went into the motive by saying he [the agent] was in the\r\nsame school, that he knew the family.\"  The court instructed the\r\njury that the report had been received solely for the purpose of\r\n\"weighing the credibility of [Agent Rodrguez].\"\r\nAt a subsequent point in the trial, after Lozada himself\r\ntook the stand and denied making incriminating remarks to Agent\r\nRodrguez, the government moved the court to accept another copy of\r\nthe report into evidence (the previous one apparently had a few\r\nparts excised).  The trial court did so, calling the jury's\r\nattention to the DEA report anew.  This time, the judge instructed\r\nthe jury that the report could be used to assess \"the credibility\r\nof this witness [Lozada]\" in addition to \"the credibility of the\r\nagent testifying on that matter,\" and \"to give the weight that [the\r\njurors] think it deserves, if any, to the testimonies.\"  (Emphasis\r\nadded).  Lozada renewed his previous objections, to no avail.\r\nOn appeal, Lozada contends that the trial judge\r\nmisapplied Rule 801(d)(1)(B).  He argues that his cross-examination\r\ndid not open the door to introduction of the report.  Citing Tome\r\nv. United States, 513 U.S. 150 (1995) (prior consistent statement\r\nmay not be admitted under Rule 801(d)(1)(B) unless it antedates\r\nalleged motive), he further argues that even if his questioning\r\nopened the door, the report could not be used to refute an implied\r\ncharge that Agent Rodrguez may have disliked Lozada or his family\r\nbecause it was prepared well after the purported bias arose.  In\r\nresponse, the government maintains that the court properly received\r\nthe report for credibility purposes, not for the truth of its\r\ncontents.  Citing a long line of cases spanning several circuits,\r\nit says that the court's evidentiary ruling had firm support in the\r\ndoctrine of rehabilitation. \r\nWe scrutinize the trial court's evidentiary ruling for an\r\nabuse of discretion.  See United States v. Reeder, 170 F.3d 93, 107\r\n(1st Cir. 1999).  Our analysis is initially complicated by a\r\ncertain degree of ambiguity as to how the report was actually used\r\nat trial.  Lozada directs our attention to certain points in the\r\nrecord suggesting that the report, in fact, was considered for the\r\ntruth of the matter asserted.  Specifically, he insists that\r\ncounsel for the government improperly argued the contents of the\r\nreport to the jury in his rebuttal argument at the close of trial. \r\nWe observe, in addition, that the trial judge seemed to tell the\r\njurors on at least one occasion that they could use the substance\r\nof the report to evaluate defendant's credibility.  \r\nFor its part, the government points out that,\r\nnotwithstanding its reference to Rule 801(d)(1)(B), the trial court\r\ncharacterized its ruling as accepting the report only for\r\ncredibility; accordingly, it specifically instructed the jury\r\nrepeatedly not to consider the report for the truth of the matter. \r\nThe government leans heavily on the doctrine of rehabilitation and\r\nignores Rule 801(d)(1)(B) almost entirely.\r\nThis confusion is somewhat understandable due to the as\r\nyet unresolved legal dilemma concerning the extent to which the\r\nRule altered preexisting common law standards governing\r\nrehabilitative use of prior statements.  It is a matter of some\r\ndebate whether Rule 801(d)(1)(B) controls prior consistent\r\nstatements of all stripes or whether a more relaxed test applies\r\nwhen a prior statement is offered for a rehabilitative purpose. \r\nCompare United States v. Miller, 874 F.2d 1255, 1273 n.12 (9th Cir.\r\n1989) (\"There is . . . no class of prior consistent statements,\r\noffered for purposes of rehabilitation, that does not fall within\r\nthe literal scope of Rule 801(d)(1)(B).\") with United States v.\r\nPierre, 781 F.2d 329, 333 (2d Cir. 1986) (irrespective of Rule\r\n801(d)(1)(B), prior consistent statement offered to rehabilitate a\r\nwitness is subject only to condition that it \"has a probative force\r\nbearing on credibility beyond merely showing repetition.\"). \r\nWe need not settle on precisely how these elements (i.e.,\r\nRule 801(d)(1)(B), Tome, and the common law notion of\r\nrehabilitation) fit together.  The uncertainty does not materially\r\nalter the calculus in the case at bar because the trial judge erred\r\nin his threshold determination that defense counsel's examination\r\nof Agent Rodrguez opened the door to the report.  This\r\ndetermination is a necessary precondition for admission of a prior\r\nstatement under the Rule or based on any other rehabilitative\r\nground, and the government failed to satisfy it.\r\nFor the most part, defense counsel's cross-examination of\r\nAgent Rodrguez was a routine affair, remarkable only for its\r\nbrevity and relative restraint.  The only arguable suggestion of\r\nimproper motive on the part of Agent Rodrguez came near the end of\r\na meandering line of questioning that ultimately bore no fruit:\r\ncounsel asked a series of questions probing whether Agent Rodrguez\r\nmight bear some ill will toward Lozada's family because he had once\r\nlived in Lozada's neighborhood and attended school with his\r\nchildren.  This was a weak innuendo at best, as any interaction\r\nbetween Agent Rodrguez and Lozada's family occurred in the distant\r\npast; he knew Lozada's children in the ninth grade, and he was 37\r\nyears old when he testified.  More important, Agent Rodrguez\r\ndenied ever having a problem with Lozada or any member of his\r\nfamily, and Lozada did not test this denial with even a single\r\nconcrete example tending to show actual bias.  Discovering nothing,\r\nhe simply moved on.  \r\nWe do not see how this attenuated suggestion of improper\r\nmotive paved the way to rebuttal by way of the official report. \r\nWhile we accord deference to a trial court's finding as to whether\r\ncounsel has implied during his questioning that a witness has a\r\nmotive to fabricate, see United States v. Piva, 870 F.2d 753, 758\r\n(1st Cir. 1989), that deference is not absolute   there must be\r\nrecord support for such a finding.  Generally speaking, a charge of\r\nimproper motive or recent fabrication need not be expressly made or\r\nbuttressed by concrete evidence.  But the proponent of evidence\r\nmust point to specific questions during his adversary's examination\r\nthat suggest recent fabrication or bias.  Merely appealing to\r\ncredibility as a live issue will not do the trick.  See Thomas v.\r\nUnited States, 41 F.3d 1109, 1119 (7th Cir. 1994) (\"One may impeach\r\nfor lack of credibility without going so far as to charge recent\r\nfabrication.\").  \r\nThere are occasions when a theory of bias is so\r\nimplausible and the corresponding suggestion of contrivance so weak\r\nthat the line of questioning would not even qualify as an implicit\r\ncharge of improper motivation.  See Christmas v. Sanders, 759 F.2d\r\n1284, 1288 (7th Cir. 1985) (theory was \"too attenuated to support\r\nany inference of an implied charge of recent fabrication\"); see\r\nalso Casoni, 950 F.2d at 904 (while the bar is not high, the clear\r\nimplication must be that the witness \"consciously altered his\r\ntestimony\"); Breneman v. Kennecott Corp., 799 F.2d 470, 473 (9th\r\nCir. 1986) (\"Mere contradictory testimony cannot give rise to an\r\nimplied charge of fabrication.\").  So it is here.  Any suggestion\r\nthat prior contact with defendant's family rendered Agent Rodrguez\r\nbiased was strained at best, and certainly should not have been\r\ndispelled by admitting an official document containing highly\r\nprejudicial information. \r\nFrom our review of the record, it is also apparent that\r\nthe trial court deemed the report relevant to aid the jury's\r\nassessment of Agent Rodrguez's credibility and later broadened its\r\nuse to include evaluation of Lozada's credibility as well.  It is\r\ndifficult to escape the conclusion that the DEA report was thrown\r\ninto the mix to assess the crucial witnesses's credibility\r\ngenerally, without either explicit or meaningful limitation.  This\r\nwas improper.\r\nWe wish to stress that the report should not have been\r\nused to assess the credibility of Lozada, which the judge\r\nencouraged the jury to do upon the conclusion of the government's\r\nexamination.  We see absolutely no reason for such a use of the\r\nreport   indeed, it may have been tantamount to an invitation to\r\nuse the report as substantive evidence.  How else could the report\r\nbear on Lozada's credibility (he did not author the report) unless\r\na factfinder compared the details of the report with Lozada's in-\r\ncourt testimony in a way that accepted both for the truth? \r\nHaving concluded that the report was erroneously admitted\r\ninto evidence, we must next decide whether the mistake requires\r\nreversal of defendant's conviction.  In order to deem the defect\r\nnon-reversible, we would have to say \"with fair assurance . . .\r\nthat the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\" \r\nUnited States v. Gaines, 170 F.3d 72, 82 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting\r\nVincent v. Louis Marx &amp; Co., 874 F.2d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 1989)); see\r\nalso Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a).  \r\nThe government bears the burden of demonstrating that the\r\noutcome would likely have been the same but for the miscue.  Here,\r\nit has expressly conceded that if the district court erred by\r\nreceiving the report, the mistake was sufficiently prejudicial as\r\nto warrant a new trial.  The government did not argue in its brief\r\nthat this kind of error could have been harmless under the present\r\nfact-scenario.  When queried at oral argument, it acknowledged that\r\ndefendant would be entitled to a new trial if we concluded that the\r\nreport was erroneously received into the record.  We wholeheartedly\r\nconcur, and commend the government for its forthrightness.\r\n We add only this thought:  Although the DEA report\r\nlargely tracked Agent Rodrguez's own in-court testimony, it\r\nessentially provided the jury with an authoritative \"condensation\r\nof the government's whole case against the defendant.\"  Quinto, 582\r\nF.2d at 236.  That this official report contained damning\r\nadmissions attributed to Lozada and that it followed the jurors\r\ninto the jury room are enough to establish that defendant was\r\nadversely affected.  See, e.g., United States v. Pendas-Martnez,\r\n845 F.2d 938, 941 (11th Cir. 1988) (erroneously admitted Coast\r\nGuard report summarized essential facts of government's case);\r\nUnited States v. Brown, 451 F.2d 1231, 1234 (5th Cir. 1971)\r\n(prejudice entailed where detailed report and handwritten notes\r\nconstituted brief recap of crucial aspects of government's case and\r\n\"accompanied the jury into the jury room\"). \r\nBecause the trial court erroneously permitted the\r\ngovernment to use the DEA report in its redirect inquiry and\r\nadmitted that report into evidence, thereby allowing the jurors to\r\nevaluate the substance of the report and give it effect in\r\ndetermining the defendant's credibility, we cannot fairly\r\ncharacterize the mistake as a harmless one.  Lozada is entitled to\r\na new trial.\r\n                             III\r\nWe also hold that the district court committed reversible\r\nerror which deprived Lozada of his Sixth Amendment right to\r\ncounsel.  Over defense counsel's objections, the trial judge\r\nallowed Torres, a cooperating witness, to testify as to a jailhouse\r\nconversation he had with Lozada the night before he was scheduled\r\nto take the stand.  Among other things, Torres claimed that Lozada\r\noffered him a financial inducement to alter his testimony at\r\ntrial.  \r\nDuring a heated exchange at sidebar, defense counsel\r\npointed out that Lozada was represented by counsel at the time of\r\nthe conversation, contended that admission of his alleged jailhouse\r\ncomments would be extremely prejudicial, and claimed that he had\r\nbeen sandbagged by this new evidence.  He later renewed his\r\nobjection and asked that Torres's testimony be stricken from the\r\nrecord, arguing in greater detail that these statements had been\r\nextracted contrary to Lozada's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. \r\nAfter asking the government a single question   whether counsel was\r\naware of any \"contacts [its agents] were trying to make between\r\ndefendant and any other witness in this case\" and receiving an\r\nanswer in the negative   the court denied the motion.\r\nUnder the rule of Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201\r\n(1964), the government may not use a defendant's words against him\r\nat trial if those words \"were deliberately elicited from him after\r\nhe had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel.\"  Id. at\r\n206.  From that critical moment onward, the Sixth Amendment imposes\r\non government agents \"an affirmative obligation to respect and\r\npreserve the accused's choice to seek th[e] assistance\" of counsel. \r\nUnited States v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 171 (1985).  The\r\ncontrolling test is whether the government agent \"intentionally\r\ncreat[ed] a situation likely to induce [a defendant] to make\r\nincriminating statements without the assistance of counsel.\" \r\nUnited States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264, 274 (1980).  That the\r\ngovernment does not explicitly instruct a cooperating witness to\r\nprocure incriminating statements does not always defeat a Massiah\r\nclaim, for conduct by an individual may in certain circumstances be\r\nimputed to the government even where it has not affirmatively\r\ndirected the person to interrogate the defendant.  See id.\r\n(defendant's alleged statements wrongly admitted even though\r\ninformant was specifically instructed not to initiate conversation\r\nbut was simply told to \"be alert to any statements\" made by\r\ndefendant); Hancock v. White, 378 F.2d 479 (1st Cir. 1967) (holding\r\nthat Massiah can be violated even though statements were procured\r\nwithout any trickery or subterfuge).\r\nThere is no question that Lozada's right to counsel had\r\nattached by the time of his jailhouse conversation with Torres.  In\r\nthe typical case, the central controversy is over whether certain\r\nstatements were deliberately elicited or whether they were\r\nspontaneously volunteered, always a fact-intensive inquiry.  Where\r\nthe witness acts only as a \"passive listening post,\" permitting a\r\njury to consider the overheard statements might not trample a\r\ndefendant's right to counsel.  See Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S.\r\n436, 459 (1986) (\"[T]he Sixth Amendment is not violated whenever  \r\nby luck or happenstance   the State obtains incriminating\r\nstatements from the accused after the right to counsel has\r\nattached\") (quoting Moulton, 474 U.S. at 176); Henry, 447 U.S. at\r\n276 (\"Massiah does not prohibit the introduction of spontaneous\r\nstatements that are not elicited by governmental action\") (Powell,\r\nJ., concurring).  The underlying rationale is that in such a\r\nscenario a defendant should not be rewarded   and the government\r\npenalized   for spilling the beans.  We bypass this usual analysis\r\nhere. \r\nIn this instance, the government has expressly conceded\r\non appeal that Torres \"deliberately elicited\" the incriminating\r\njailhouse statements from Lozada and that Torres was a government\r\nagent for purposes of our Massiah analysis.  It argues only that\r\nthe error was harmless given the weight of the evidence against\r\nhim.\r\nWe strongly disagree that admission of these statements\r\nwas harmless.  Constitutional error of this nature is harmless only\r\nif it can be said \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the error\r\ncomplained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\"  Chapman\r\nv. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967); see Milton v. Wainwright,\r\n407 U.S. 371, 377-78 (1972) (applying reasonable doubt standard to\r\nassess effect of Massiah violation).  This attempt to ascertain the\r\nprobable impact of the error requires us to weigh the quantum of\r\nthe government's evidence of guilt against the inherent gravity of\r\nthe miscue.\r\nThe government tendered substantial evidence pointing\r\ntoward Lozada's guilt.  Several witnesses testified that he played\r\na prominent role in the transportation unit, and this testimony and\r\ndocumentary evidence also revealed seemingly suspicious\r\ncircumstances casting a pall on his protestations of innocence. \r\nThe prosecution's case was not, however, so one-sided that we can\r\nfairly say that the damaging testimony provided by had little or no\r\neffect on the jury's decision.  In addition, the harmless error\r\ntest is more stringent where an error of constitutional dimension\r\nhas infected the trial.  The government cannot surmount this\r\nobstacle. \r\nThe government urges us to conclude that the\r\nconstitutional error likely had a de minimis effect because Lozada\r\nsupposedly asked Torres to shade his testimony only as to one\r\nparticular transaction, the implication being that evidence that\r\ndefendant selectively tampered with a witness did not necessarily\r\ntaint the entire proceedings.  \r\nThis argument grossly underestimates the impact of the\r\njailhouse statements attributed to Lozada.  In all likelihood, the\r\nmere suggestion that Lozada asked   or even worse, that he tried\r\nto bribe   a material witness (and alleged co-conspirator) to alter\r\nhis testimony the night before he was to testify destroyed Lozada's\r\ncredibility, for a jury would reasonably presume that an innocent\r\nman would have no reason to ask a witness to shade his testimony. \r\nPut another way, this bit of evidence strongly tended to show that\r\na guilty mind was at work.  Once heard, it could well have become\r\nthe colored lens through which the jury viewed all of the other\r\nevidence. \r\nReversed and remanded for a new trial.  So ordered.\n",

Fischer, Attorney, United States Department of\r\nJustice, with whom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, was on\r\nbrief for appellee.\r\n\nMay 27, 1994\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  Defendant-appellant Jos\r\nLuis Lozada-Rivera (\"Lozada\") challenges his criminal conviction\r\nfor conspiracy to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine with\r\nintent to distribute.  He raises several issues on appeal,\r\nincluding asserted defects in the trial court's evidentiary rulings\r\nand its instructions to the jury.  We address only two of his\r\nweightiest claims:  that the trial judge erred in admitting into\r\nevidence a federal agent's report containing his version of\r\napparently incriminating statements made by defendant during a\r\npost-arrest interview; and that the court improperly permitted a\r\ngovernment witness to testify that Lozada had recently asked him to\r\nalter his testimony.  We reverse and remand for a new trial on both\r\nscores.  \r\nThe court should not have allowed the jury to consider\r\nthe contents of the report, either for the truth of the matter\r\nasserted therein or for a more limited rehabilitative purpose. \r\nAnd, as the government now concedes, the court should not have\r\npermitted testimony about Lozada's jailhouse remarks elicited in\r\nviolation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  We conclude\r\nthat neither of these errors was harmless.\r\n                              I\r\nOn February 19, 1997, a federal grand jury indicted\r\nLozada and three others on one count of conspiracy to traffic\r\ncocaine, 21 U.S.C.  846, and four counts of possession with intent\r\nto distribute,  21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1).  His fellow co-defendants\r\npled out before trial; Lozada opted to take his chances with a jury\r\nof his peers.\r\nDuring the course of his nine-day trial in September\r\n1997, the government introduced substantial evidence of a scheme to\r\ntransport several hundred kilograms of cocaine from Puerto Rico to\r\nthe New York metropolitan area.  The evidence established that the\r\ndrug trafficking operation, with a few minor variations, worked in\r\nthe following manner:  Members of a transportation group received\r\nthe cocaine from Colombian suppliers in Puerto Rico and delivered\r\nit to a warehouse owned by Lozada.  Once at the warehouse, they\r\nwould elaborately repackage the cocaine by concealing it in cargo\r\ncontainers containing corn oil, coconuts, syrup, and other food\r\nstuff.  The narcotics were then smuggled to New York masked as\r\nlegitimate products. \r\nJairo Rodrguez-Zuluaga (\"Rodrguez\"), who served as the\r\nliaison between the transportation group and the Colombian\r\nsuppliers, would usually assist in the repackaging process and then\r\ntravel to New York to receive the shipment.  The conspirators later\r\nmet in a hotel in New Jersey to be paid for their labor.  This\r\nentire process was repeated several times between 1994 and 1996. \r\nThe responsible parties transported some 100-800 kilograms of\r\ncocaine from Puerto Rico to New York in this fashion.\r\nThe government advanced a theory of the case according to\r\nwhich Lozada and Carlos Rosario-Matos (\"Rosario\") jointly headed\r\nthe transportation group and, after Rosario's arrest in 1995,\r\nLozada assumed full control of the unit.  As the government's\r\nwitnesses told it, for each shipment Lozada secured the necessary\r\ncargo containers, prepared the shipping paperwork (listing \"Loza\r\nFoods\" as the putative shipping company), and purchased the\r\nlegitimate items ultimately used to fill the containers and conceal\r\nthe cocaine.  Lozada operated Las Vegas Brands, Inc., a food\r\nproducts import-export company based in Puerto Rico, whose supplies\r\nand property were used for the repackaging activities of the\r\ntransportation group.  The prosecutor tendered other circumstantial\r\nevidence of Lozada's guilt:  he made certain suspiciously large\r\ncash deposits into his business account, kept sizeable sums of cash\r\nnearby, and made seemingly extravagant expenditures for a person of\r\nrelatively modest means.\r\nThree cooperating witnesses tied Lozada to the conspiracy\r\n(a fourth stated that he saw Lozada at a meeting where the elements\r\nof the scheme were discussed).  Rosario, who originally established\r\ncontact with the Colombian suppliers on his own, testified that\r\nLozada got involved after the first shipment, and that he\r\nthereafter shared half his profits from future shipments with\r\nLozada. \r\nRodrguez, the go-between, stated that he saw Lozada, who\r\nhe knew as \"Don Millin,\" present at repackaging sessions and that\r\nLozada showed up to get paid on at least one occasion.  Abelardo\r\nTorres-Padilla (\"Torres\"), too, placed Lozada in the general\r\nvicinity of the warehouse when the cocaine was being placed in the\r\ncontainers, and claimed that he informed Lozada by telephone that\r\na July 1995 shipment had been seized by Customs agents.  Over\r\nstrong objections by the defense, Torres also testified that the\r\nnight before he was to take the stand, Lozada offered him money if\r\nhe would change his testimony (the two were housed in the same\r\ndetention facility).  \r\nThe centerpiece evidence of Lozada's involvement in the\r\nconspiracy, however, were certain incriminating statements\r\nallegedly uttered by Lozada on the day of his arrest when he\r\ninitially opted to cooperate with the authorities.  The government\r\nurged the jury to view these comments purportedly made in the\r\npresence of federal law enforcement officers, including Drug\r\nEnforcement Agency (\"DEA\") Agent Rafael E. Rodrguez (\"Agent\r\nRodrguez\"), as a \"confession.\"  Agent Rodrguez was the only\r\nwitness to testify at trial that Lozada incriminated himself.  He\r\nwas cross-examined by the defense.  Then, at a critical juncture in\r\nthe proceedings and on redirect, the prosecution offered a detailed\r\ntypewritten report ostensibly to repair Agent Rodrguez's\r\ncredibility.  This report paraphrased a series of damaging\r\nstatements allegedly made by Lozada, thereby buttressing the\r\nagent's oral testimony.  Again over defendant's objections, the\r\ncourt accepted this evidence.  \r\nTaking the stand in his own defense, Lozada testified\r\nthat he had met some of the principals in the alleged conspiracy\r\nunder completely innocent circumstances.  He also acknowledged that\r\nhe sometimes allowed Rosario, his long-time friend, to use his\r\nwarehouse for storage space, but denied actively participating in\r\na drug trafficking conspiracy.  He vehemently denied making any\r\nincriminating statements to government agents after his arrest. \r\nHis nephew took the stand and said that he had, on occasion,\r\nprepared paperwork on Rosario's behalf using the shipping name\r\n\"Loza Foods.\"  Other witnesses attested to Lozada's reputation for\r\ntruth-telling.\r\nOn September 22, 1997, after a few hours of deliberation,\r\nthe jury convicted Lozada on all counts.  The court subsequently\r\nsentenced him to 210 months of imprisonment followed by five years\r\nof supervised release, after departing downward from the applicable\r\nsentencing guideline range based on his advanced age and\r\nsignificant physical ailments.  Lozada filed a timely appeal.\r\n                              II\r\nWe lead off with the issue of whether the trial court\r\nerred by accepting the DEA report into evidence.  During the\r\ngovernment's case-in-chief, Agent Rodrguez testified that Lozada\r\nmade certain incriminating comments during a post-arrest interview\r\non May 4, 1997.  According to Agent Rodrguez, Lozada admitted his\r\nrole in the conspiracy and explained his actions in furtherance of\r\nits objectives.\r\nDuring cross-examination, defense counsel established\r\nthat the interview had not been tape-recorded or videotaped.  He\r\nthen asked Agent Rodrguez to confirm that he had once lived in\r\nLozada's neighborhood and attended school with his children, and\r\ninquired whether he had anything against Lozada or his family. \r\nAgent Rodrguez answered in the negative, and counsel pressed no\r\nfurther.\r\nOn redirect, the government sought to introduce a formal\r\nreport prepared by Agent Rodrguez in which he recounted his\r\nversion of Lozada's alleged comments during the March 4, 1997\r\ninterview, to rebut what it believed to be a charge of improper\r\nmotive made during defense counsel's examination.  The DEA report\r\ncharacterized the discussion as marked by defendant's willingness\r\nto \"talk about the events that led to his involvement in drug\r\ntrafficking activities,\" and ascribed to Lozada certain admissions\r\nrevealing his awareness of crucial details of the drug trafficking\r\nring, including the method of smuggling the cocaine and his\r\nfamiliarity with key players in the scheme.  Agent Rodrguez\r\napparently completed the report a day or two after the actual\r\ninterview based on contemporaneous notes he had taken during the\r\nconversation, which have since been destroyed.  The government\r\nexplicitly \"offered [the report] under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)\" to\r\n\"rebut the attack on his credibility.\"\r\nDefense counsel objected, saying that the contents of the\r\nreport were overly prejudicial and constituted inadmissible\r\nhearsay.  The district court overruled defendant's objections and\r\nallowed the report into evidence, ruling that it was admissible to\r\nrebut Lozada's implied charge of improper motivation because\r\ncounsel \"went into the motive by saying he [the agent] was in the\r\nsame school, that he knew the family.\"  The court instructed the\r\njury that the report had been received solely for the purpose of\r\n\"weighing the credibility of [Agent Rodrguez].\"\r\nAt a subsequent point in the trial, after Lozada himself\r\ntook the stand and denied making incriminating remarks to Agent\r\nRodrguez, the government moved the court to accept another copy of\r\nthe report into evidence (the previous one apparently had a few\r\nparts excised).  The trial court did so, calling the jury's\r\nattention to the DEA report anew.  This time, the judge instructed\r\nthe jury that the report could be used to assess \"the credibility\r\nof this witness [Lozada]\" in addition to \"the credibility of the\r\nagent testifying on that matter,\" and \"to give the weight that [the\r\njurors] think it deserves, if any, to the testimonies.\"  (Emphasis\r\nadded).  Lozada renewed his previous objections, to no avail.\r\nOn appeal, Lozada contends that the trial judge\r\nmisapplied Rule 801(d)(1)(B).  He argues that his cross-examination\r\ndid not open the door to introduction of the report.  Citing Tome\r\nv. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117887\"><a href=\"/opinion/117887/tome-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995) (prior consistent statement\r\nmay not be admitted under Rule 801(d)(1)(B) unless it antedates\r\nalleged motive), he further argues that even if his questioning\r\nopened the door, the report could not be used to refute an implied\r\ncharge that Agent Rodrguez may have disliked Lozada or his family\r\nbecause it was prepared well after the purported bias arose.  In\r\nresponse, the government maintains that the court properly received\r\nthe report for credibility purposes, not for the truth of its\r\ncontents.  Citing a long line of cases spanning several circuits,\r\nit says that the court's evidentiary ruling had firm support in the\r\ndoctrine of rehabilitation. \r\nWe scrutinize the trial court's evidentiary ruling for an\r\nabuse of discretion.  See United States v. Reeder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762263\"><a href=\"/opinion/762263/united-states-v-george-wayneti-reeder-aka-wayne-reeder/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 107\r\n(1st Cir. 1999).  Our analysis is initially complicated by a\r\ncertain degree of ambiguity as to how the report was actually used\r\nat trial.  Lozada directs our attention to certain points in the\r\nrecord suggesting that the report, in fact, was considered for the\r\ntruth of the matter asserted.  Specifically, he insists that\r\ncounsel for the government improperly argued the contents of the\r\nreport to the jury in his rebuttal argument at the close of trial. \r\nWe observe, in addition, that the trial judge seemed to tell the\r\njurors on at least one occasion that they could use the substance\r\nof the report to evaluate defendant's credibility.  \r\nFor its part, the government points out that,\r\nnotwithstanding its reference to Rule 801(d)(1)(B), the trial court\r\ncharacterized its ruling as accepting the report only for\r\ncredibility; accordingly, it specifically instructed the jury\r\nrepeatedly not to consider the report for the truth of the matter. \r\nThe government leans heavily on the doctrine of rehabilitation and\r\nignores Rule 801(d)(1)(B) almost entirely.\r\nThis confusion is somewhat understandable due to the as\r\nyet unresolved legal dilemma concerning the extent to which the\r\nRule altered preexisting common law standards governing\r\nrehabilitative use of prior statements.  It is a matter of some\r\ndebate whether Rule 801(d)(1)(B) controls prior consistent\r\nstatements of all stripes or whether a more relaxed test applies\r\nwhen a prior statement is offered for a rehabilitative purpose. \r\nCompare United States v. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"523192\"><a href=\"/opinion/523192/united-states-v-richard-w-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1273 n.12 (9th Cir.\r\n1989) (\"There is . . . no class of prior consistent statements,\r\noffered for purposes of rehabilitation, that does not fall within\r\nthe literal scope of Rule 801(d)(1)(B).\") with United States v.\r\nPierre, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463300\"><a href=\"/opinion/463300/united-states-v-michel-pierre/\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (2d Cir. 1986) (irrespective of Rule\r\n801(d)(1)(B), prior consistent statement offered to rehabilitate a\r\nwitness is subject only to condition that it \"has a probative force\r\nbearing on credibility beyond merely showing repetition.\"). \r\nWe need not settle on precisely how these elements (i.e.,\r\nRule 801(d)(1)(B), Tome, and the common law notion of\r\nrehabilitation) fit together.  The uncertainty does not materially\r\nalter the calculus in the case at bar because the trial judge erred\r\nin his threshold determination that defense counsel's examination\r\nof Agent Rodrguez opened the door to the report.  This\r\ndetermination is a necessary precondition for admission of a prior\r\nstatement under the Rule or based on any other rehabilitative\r\nground, and the government failed to satisfy it.\r\nFor the most part, defense counsel's cross-examination of\r\nAgent Rodrguez was a routine affair, remarkable only for its\r\nbrevity and relative restraint.  The only arguable suggestion of\r\nimproper motive on the part of Agent Rodrguez came near the end of\r\na meandering line of questioning that ultimately bore no fruit:\r\ncounsel asked a series of questions probing whether Agent Rodrguez\r\nmight bear some ill will toward Lozada's family because he had once\r\nlived in Lozada's neighborhood and attended school with his\r\nchildren.  This was a weak innuendo at best, as any interaction\r\nbetween Agent Rodrguez and Lozada's family occurred in the distant\r\npast; he knew Lozada's children in the ninth grade, and he was 37\r\nyears old when he testified.  More important, Agent Rodrguez\r\ndenied ever having a problem with Lozada or any member of his\r\nfamily, and Lozada did not test this denial with even a single\r\nconcrete example tending to show actual bias.  Discovering nothing,\r\nhe simply moved on.  \r\nWe do not see how this attenuated suggestion of improper\r\nmotive paved the way to rebuttal by way of the official report. \r\nWhile we accord deference to a trial court's finding as to whether\r\ncounsel has implied during his questioning that a witness has a\r\nmotive to fabricate, see United States v. Piva, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520291\"><a href=\"/opinion/520291/united-states-v-joseph-piva/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 758\r\n(1st Cir. 1989), that deference is not absolute   there must be\r\nrecord support for such a finding.  Generally speaking, a charge of\r\nimproper motive or recent fabrication need not be expressly made or\r\nbuttressed by concrete evidence.  But the proponent of evidence\r\nmust point to specific questions during his adversary's examination\r\nthat suggest recent fabrication or bias.  Merely appealing to\r\ncredibility as a live issue will not do the trick.  See Thomas v.\r\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683548\"><a href=\"/opinion/683548/lacy-thomas-plaintiff-counterclaim-and-colette-thomas-and-percy-giles/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1119 (7th Cir. 1994) (\"One may impeach\r\nfor lack of credibility without going so far as to charge recent\r\nfabrication.\").  \r\nThere are occasions when a theory of bias is so\r\nimplausible and the corresponding suggestion of contrivance so weak\r\nthat the line of questioning would not even qualify as an implicit\r\ncharge of improper motivation.  See Christmas v. Sanders, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450758\"><a href=\"/opinion/450758/stanley-christmas-v-lolita-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1288 (7th Cir. 1985) (theory was \"too attenuated to support\r\nany inference of an implied charge of recent fabrication\"); see\r\nalso Casoni, 950 F.2d at 904 (while the bar is not high, the clear\r\nimplication must be that the witness \"consciously altered his\r\ntestimony\"); Breneman v. Kennecott Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"475309\"><a href=\"/opinion/475309/41-fair-emplpraccas-1157-41-empl-prac-dec-p-36560-21-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 473 (9th\r\nCir. 1986) (\"Mere contradictory testimony cannot give rise to an\r\nimplied charge of fabrication.\").  So it is here.  Any suggestion\r\nthat prior contact with defendant's family rendered Agent Rodrguez\r\nbiased was strained at best, and certainly should not have been\r\ndispelled by admitting an official document containing highly\r\nprejudicial information. \r\nFrom our review of the record, it is also apparent that\r\nthe trial court deemed the report relevant to aid the jury's\r\nassessment of Agent Rodrguez's credibility and later broadened its\r\nuse to include evaluation of Lozada's credibility as well.  It is\r\ndifficult to escape the conclusion that the DEA report was thrown\r\ninto the mix to assess the crucial witnesses's credibility\r\ngenerally, without either explicit or meaningful limitation.  This\r\nwas improper.\r\nWe wish to stress that the report should not have been\r\nused to assess the credibility of Lozada, which the judge\r\nencouraged the jury to do upon the conclusion of the government's\r\nexamination.  We see absolutely no reason for such a use of the\r\nreport   indeed, it may have been tantamount to an invitation to\r\nuse the report as substantive evidence.  How else could the report\r\nbear on Lozada's credibility (he did not author the report) unless\r\na factfinder compared the details of the report with Lozada's in-\r\ncourt testimony in a way that accepted both for the truth? \r\nHaving concluded that the report was erroneously admitted\r\ninto evidence, we must next decide whether the mistake requires\r\nreversal of defendant's conviction.  In order to deem the defect\r\nnon-reversible, we would have to say \"with fair assurance . . .\r\nthat the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\" \r\nUnited States v. Gaines, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198451\"><a href=\"/opinion/198451/united-states-v-gaines/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 82 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting\r\nVincent v.

R. Crim. P. 52(a).  \r\nThe government bears the burden of demonstrating that the\r\noutcome would likely have been the same but for the miscue.  Here,\r\nit has expressly conceded that if the district court erred by\r\nreceiving the report, the mistake was sufficiently prejudicial as\r\nto warrant a new trial.  The government did not argue in its brief\r\nthat this kind of error could have been harmless under the present\r\nfact-scenario.  When queried at oral argument, it acknowledged that\r\ndefendant would be entitled to a new trial if we concluded that the\r\nreport was erroneously received into the record.  We wholeheartedly\r\nconcur, and commend the government for its forthrightness.\r\n We add only this thought:  Although the DEA report\r\nlargely tracked Agent Rodrguez's own in-court testimony, it\r\nessentially provided the jury with an authoritative \"condensation\r\nof the government's whole case against the defendant.\"  Quinto, 582\r\nF.2d at 236.  That this official report contained damning\r\nadmissions attributed to Lozada and that it followed the jurors\r\ninto the jury room are enough to establish that defendant was\r\nadversely affected.  See, e.g., United States v. Pendas-Martnez,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504956\"><a href=\"/opinion/504956/united-states-v-angel-pendas-martinez-and-andres-morrero-laso/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 941 (11th Cir. 1988) (erroneously admitted Coast\r\nGuard report summarized essential facts of government's case);\r\nUnited States v.

Lozada is entitled to\r\na new trial.\r\n                             III\r\nWe also hold that the district court committed reversible\r\nerror which deprived Lozada of his Sixth Amendment right to\r\ncounsel.  Over defense counsel's objections, the trial judge\r\nallowed Torres, a cooperating witness, to testify as to a jailhouse\r\nconversation he had with Lozada the night before he was scheduled\r\nto take the stand.  Among other things, Torres claimed that Lozada\r\noffered him a financial inducement to alter his testimony at\r\ntrial.  \r\nDuring a heated exchange at sidebar, defense counsel\r\npointed out that Lozada was represented by counsel at the time of\r\nthe conversation, contended that admission of his alleged jailhouse\r\ncomments would be extremely prejudicial, and claimed that he had\r\nbeen sandbagged by this new evidence.  He later renewed his\r\nobjection and asked that Torres's testimony be stricken from the\r\nrecord, arguing in greater detail that these statements had been\r\nextracted contrary to Lozada's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. \r\nAfter asking the government a single question   whether counsel was\r\naware of any \"contacts [its agents] were trying to make between\r\ndefendant and any other witness in this case\" and receiving an\r\nanswer in the negative   the court denied the motion.\r\nUnder the rule of Massiah v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106822\"><a href=\"/opinion/106822/massiah-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(1964), the government may not use a defendant's words against him\r\nat trial if those words \"were deliberately elicited from him after\r\nhe had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel.\"  Id. at\r\n206.  From that critical moment onward, the Sixth Amendment imposes\r\non government agents \"an affirmative obligation to respect and\r\npreserve the accused's choice to seek th[e] assistance\" of counsel. \r\nUnited States v. Moulton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111546\"><a href=\"/opinion/111546/maine-v-moulton/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171 (1985).  The\r\ncontrolling test is whether the government agent \"intentionally\r\ncreat[ed] a situation likely to induce [a defendant] to make\r\nincriminating statements without the assistance of counsel.\" \r\nUnited States v. Henry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110300\"><a href=\"/opinion/110300/united-states-v-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 274 (1980).  That the\r\ngovernment does not explicitly instruct a cooperating witness to\r\nprocure incriminating statements does not always defeat a Massiah\r\nclaim, for conduct by an individual may in certain circumstances be\r\nimputed to the government even where it has not affirmatively\r\ndirected the person to interrogate the defendant.  See id.\r\n(defendant's alleged statements wrongly admitted even though\r\ninformant was specifically instructed not to initiate conversation\r\nbut was simply told to \"be alert to any statements\" made by\r\ndefendant); Hancock v. White, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"276175\"><a href=\"/opinion/276175/parker-l-hancock-warden-new-hampshire-state-prison-v-charles-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1967) (holding\r\nthat Massiah can be violated even though statements were procured\r\nwithout any trickery or subterfuge).\r\nThere is no question that Lozada's right to counsel had\r\nattached by the time of his jailhouse conversation with Torres.  In\r\nthe typical case, the central controversy is over whether certain\r\nstatements were deliberately elicited or whether they were\r\nspontaneously volunteered, always a fact-intensive inquiry.  Where\r\nthe witness acts only as a \"passive listening post,\" permitting a\r\njury to consider the overheard statements might not trample a\r\ndefendant's right to counsel.  See Kuhlmann v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111726\"><a href=\"/opinion/111726/kuhlmann-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 459 (1986) (\"[T]he Sixth Amendment is not violated whenever  \r\nby luck or happenstance   the State obtains incriminating\r\nstatements from the accused after the right to counsel has\r\nattached\") (quoting Moulton, 474 U.S. at 176); Henry, 447 U.S. at\r\n276 (\"Massiah does not prohibit the introduction of spontaneous\r\nstatements that are not elicited by governmental action\") (Powell,\r\nJ., concurring).  The underlying rationale is that in such a\r\nscenario a defendant should not be rewarded   and the government\r\npenalized   for spilling the beans.  We bypass this usual analysis\r\nhere. \r\nIn this instance, the government has expressly conceded\r\non appeal that Torres \"deliberately elicited\" the incriminating\r\njailhouse statements from Lozada and that Torres was a government\r\nagent for purposes of our Massiah analysis.  It argues only that\r\nthe error was harmless given the weight of the evidence against\r\nhim.\r\nWe strongly disagree that admission of these statements\r\nwas harmless.  Constitutional error of this nature is harmless only\r\nif it can be said \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the error\r\ncomplained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\"  Chapman\r\nv. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (1967); see Milton v. Wainwright,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108585\"><a href=\"/opinion/108585/milton-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377-78 (1972) (applying reasonable doubt standard to\r\nassess effect of Massiah violation).  This attempt to ascertain the\r\nprobable impact of the error requires us to weigh the quantum of\r\nthe government's evidence of guilt against the inherent gravity of\r\nthe miscue.\r\nThe government tendered substantial evidence pointing\r\ntoward Lozada's guilt.  Several witnesses testified that he played\r\na prominent role in the transportation unit, and this testimony and\r\ndocumentary evidence also revealed seemingly suspicious\r\ncircumstances casting a pall on his protestations of innocence. \r\nThe prosecution's case was not, however, so one-sided that we can\r\nfairly say that the damaging testimony provided by had little or no\r\neffect on the jury's decision.  In addition, the harmless error\r\ntest is more stringent where an error of constitutional dimension\r\nhas infected the trial.  The government cannot surmount this\r\nobstacle. \r\nThe government urges us to conclude that the\r\nconstitutional error likely had a de minimis effect because Lozada\r\nsupposedly asked Torres to shade his testimony only as to one\r\nparticular transaction, the implication being that evidence that\r\ndefendant selectively tampered with a witness did not necessarily\r\ntaint the entire proceedings.  \r\nThis argument grossly underestimates the impact of the\r\njailhouse statements attributed to Lozada.  In all likelihood, the\r\nmere suggestion that Lozada asked   or even worse, that he tried\r\nto bribe   a material witness (and alleged co-conspirator) to alter\r\nhis testimony the night before he was to testify destroyed Lozada's\r\ncredibility, for a jury would reasonably presume that an innocent\r\nman would have no reason to ask a witness to shade his testimony. \r\nPut another way, this bit of evidence strongly tended to show that\r\na guilty mind was at work.  Once heard, it could well have become\r\nthe colored lens through which the jury viewed all of the other\r\nevidence. \r\nReversed and remanded for a new trial.  So ordered.\n</pre>",
