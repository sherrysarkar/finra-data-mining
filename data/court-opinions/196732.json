This litigation has already used up an\r                      Per Curiam.\r                                \r\n\nenormous amount  of legal talent and  judicial resources over\r\n\nits  seven-year life.  The ultimate issue is simply the value\r\n\nof  a   minority  shareholder's  stake  in   a  closely  held\r\n\ncorporation.   Yet, the dispute  has resulted so  far in more\r\n\nthan 250  entries  on  the  district court  docket  and  four\r\n\ndistrict court  orders published  in the  Federal Supplement.\r\n\nThis is the third occasion on which the numerous protagonists\r\n\nof this legal war have brought appeals before us; none of the\r\n\nappeals concern the principal issue in  the litigation.  From\r\n\nall we can tell, the end is not yet in sight.\r\n\n          Now  two district  court judges  have  entered what\r\n\nappear to  be conflicting  orders affecting  interim payments\r\n\ndue to  the appellee.  Orders by a third district judge and a\r\n\nmagistrate judge also implicate those payments, and a bevy of\r\n\nlawyers, for themselves and  for their clients, have asserted\r\n\nclaims  and  liens  against  the  same  funds.    The  issues\r\n\npresented in this appeal could have been resolved without our\r\n\nintervention  if the  parties  were disposed  to manage  this\r\n\nlitigation  with a  view toward  resolving issues  instead of\r\n\nproliferating them.\r\n\n          In  any case,  there are before  us for  review two\r\n\ndifferent  orders  of  the  district  court  entered  on  two\r\n\ndifferent  dates.   The  first is  the  July 26,  1995, order\r\n\ndenying a motion by Woloohijian Realty Corporation (\"WRC\") to\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nmodify the July 13, 1990, order directing WRC to make monthly\r\n\npayments  to Bogosian.   The  second is  the August  8, 1995,\r\n\norder  releasing funds to Bogosian  that had been  held in an\r\n\nescrow  account  pursuant to  a June  8,  1993, order  of the\r\n\nmagistrate judge.   We  treat the  two orders  separately for\r\n\nreasons that will become apparent.\r\n\n          1.   There is no apparent  jurisdictional basis for\r\n\nimmediate  appeal of the August 8 order.   This order, so far\r\n\nas  it is  contested on  appeal, merely released  to Bogosian\r\n\nfunds held under  an escrow established  at the direction  of\r\n\nthe  magistrate  judge and  held  explicitly  subject to  the\r\n\ncontrol of the court.  The district court ruled  (1) that the\r\n\nmagistrate judge lacked authority to order these funds placed\r\n\nin escrow and (2)  even if that course had  been permissible,\r\n\nthe funds should now be disbursed from escrow to Bogosian.\r\n\n          Contrary to appellants'  assumption, this order  is\r\n\nnot  in form  an injunction  immediately appealable  under 28\r\n\nU.S.C.    1292(a)(1).    Sometimes orders  not designated  as\r\n\ninjunctions  are  so  treated  where  irreparable  injury  is\r\n\nthreatened,  Carson  v.  American  Brands, 450  U.S.  79,  84\r                                                     \r\n\n(1981),  but here  there is  also no  showing of  irreparable\r\n\ninjury.   The court's  disposition  of funds  within its  own\r\n\ncontrol does  not create any  danger that appellants  will be\r\n\nheld  in contempt by another  judge; nor is  it apparent that\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nthis  single  transfer  of  funds to  Bogosian  will  subject\r\n\nappellants to the potential for excessive liability.\r\n\n          2.    The July  26  order  refusing to  modify  the\r\n\nearlier injunction stands on a different footing.  Appellants\r\n\nhad  urged its  modification,  arguing  that  the  injunction\r\n\n(directing them to make payments monthly to Bogosian) clashed\r\n\nwith a later  directive of  another judge of  the same  court\r\n\ndirecting appellants to  withhold the  monthly payments  from\r\n\nBogosian pursuant  to an attachment  order in favor  of other\r\n\ncreditors.1   The  refusal   to   modify  an   injunction  is\r\n\nordinarily appealable at once.  Section 1292(a)(1).\r\n\n          The  district court  based its  July 26  refusal to\r\n\nmodify on the  ground that  appellants would not  be held  in\r\n\ncontempt  for distributing  funds in  the court's  \"custody.\"\r\n\nRhode Island  law is  unsettled  as to  the scope  of the  in\r                                                                         \r\n\ncustodia legis doctrine.   While we agree that this reasoning\r                          \r\n\nwould  likely  apply to  the escrowed  funds,  it is  at best\r\n\ndebatable  whether in  the present  circumstances unearmarked\r\n\nfunds  held by  appellants would  meet this  description; and\r\n\nassuming that appellants are under a conflicting order not to\r\n\npay  those funds  to  Bogosian, we  think  that the  district\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  We  have assumed  this  conflict arguendo  because it  is\r                                                         \r\nasserted  by  appellants and  not  directly  disputed by  the\r\ndistrict court,  the appellee or the  record materials before\r\nus.   But we note that  the record before us  is not complete\r\nand are not ourselves ruling that the conflict exists.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ncourt's reasoning  does not explain away  the apparent threat\r\n\nto appellants.\r\n\n          3.   In  remanding  for further  consideration,  we\r\n\nthink  it  important  to  emphasize that  there  are  serious\r\n\nproblems  of both  appearance  and fairness  when a  litigant\r\n\nseems to be subject to conflicting directives from two judges\r\n\nof  the  same court.    However  tangled  and  vexatious  the\r\n\nlitigation  may  be,  this  apparent  conflict  needs  to  be\r\n\nresolved, either by establishing  that the judicial orders do\r\n\nnot conflict,  or by harmonizing  the appellants' obligations\r\n\nto the several claimants to the funds.\r\n\n          One solution might be for the court to act promptly\r\n\non the  long-pending interpleader action by  which appellants\r\n\nhave    sought   to    reconcile   the    alleged   conflict.\r\n\nAlternatively,  it  might be  possible  to  consolidate these\r\n\nactions before  a single judge so  that he or she  can make a\r\n\nbinding  determination as  to  the scope  of the  appellants'\r\n\ninterim  obligations.   Whatever  course  the district  court\r\n\nadopts,  we think this aspect of the matter does need careful\r\n\nbut prompt attention.\r\n\n          The appeal  from the August  4, 1995, order  of the\r\n\ndistrict court is dismissed.  The July 26, 1995, order of the\r                                       \r\n\ndistrict court  is vacated, and  that matter is  remanded for\r                                                                     \r\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this order.\r\n\n          It is so ordered.\r                      It is so ordered\r                                      \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n",

We  have assumed  this  conflict arguendo  because it  is\r                                                         \r\nasserted  by  appellants and  not  directly  disputed by  the\r\ndistrict court,  the appellee or the  record materials before\r\nus.   But we note that  the record before us  is not complete\r\nand are not ourselves ruling that the conflict exists.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ncourt's reasoning  does not explain away  the apparent threat\r\n\nto appellants.\r\n\n          3.   In  remanding  for further  consideration,  we\r\n\nthink  it  important  to  emphasize that  there  are  serious\r\n\nproblems  of both  appearance  and fairness  when a  litigant\r\n\nseems to be subject to conflicting directives from two judges\r\n\nof  the  same court.    However  tangled  and  vexatious  the\r\n\nlitigation  may  be,  this  apparent  conflict  needs  to  be\r\n\nresolved, either by establishing  that the judicial orders do\r\n\nnot conflict,  or by harmonizing  the appellants' obligations\r\n\nto the several claimants to the funds.\r\n\n          One solution might be for the court to act promptly\r\n\non the  long-pending interpleader action by  which appellants\r\n\nhave    sought   to    reconcile   the    alleged   conflict.\r\n\nAlternatively,  it  might be  possible  to  consolidate these\r\n\nactions before  a single judge so  that he or she  can make a\r\n\nbinding  determination as  to  the scope  of the  appellants'\r\n\ninterim  obligations.   Whatever  course  the district  court\r\n\nadopts,  we think this aspect of the matter does need careful\r\n\nbut prompt attention.\r\n\n          The appeal  from the August  4, 1995, order  of the\r\n\ndistrict court is dismissed.  The July 26, 1995, order of the\r                                       \r\n\ndistrict court  is vacated, and  that matter is  remanded for\r                                                                     \r\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this order.\r\n\n          It is so ordered.\r                      It is so ordered\r                                      \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n</pre>",
