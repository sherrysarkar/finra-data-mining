While  incarcerated  at  MCI-Norfolk  in\r\n\nMassachusetts,  plaintiff  Walter  Johnson  suffered   severe\r\n\ninjuries upon being stabbed by a fellow inmate.  He filed the\r\n\ninstant  S 1983  action  against  various  prison  officials,\r\n\nalleging,  inter alia,  that  they had  exhibited  deliberate\r\n\nindifference to  his safety and  health in  violation of  the\r\n\nEighth Amendment.  The district court, after first dismissing\r\n\nthe \r               action \r                      for \r                         want \r                              of \r                                 prosecution, then declined to vacate the\r\n\norder \r                 of \r                    dismissal \r                             on \r                                the independent ground that plaintiff had\r\n\nfailed  to state  a claim.   See  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  12(b)(6).\r\n\nPlaintiff has appealed from both of these rulings.  We affirm\r\n\non the latter ground alone.\r\n\n     We acknowledge  the seriousness of  the assault and  the\r\n\nseverity of plaintiff's  injuries; we find no cause here,  on\r\n\nlegal grounds, for extended discussion.

Farmer, 511 U.S.  at 828.   And\r\n\ndeliberate indifference  requires  a showing  of  \"subjective\r\n\nrecklessness,\" id. at 839--i.e., a showing that \"the official\r\n\nknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or\r\n\nsafety,\" id. at 837.  \r\n\n     Nothing in plaintiff's amended complaint, even with  all\r\n\nreasonable inferences drawn in his favor, would permit such a\r\n\nfinding.  With respect to the stabbing incident, his  factual\r\n\nallegations \r                       provide \r                              no \r                                 basis for concluding that the attack was\r\n\nin  any  way  foreseeable   or  that  the  named   defendants\r\n\n(supervisory \r                        officials all) had any inkling that such an event\r\n\nmight occur.  Nor, assuming arguendo that the Farmer  inquiry\r\n\ndoes not  foreclose the matter,  has plaintiff proffered  any\r\n\ngrounds for imposing supervisory liability on defendants  for\r\n\nthe \r               behavior \r                        of a subordinate.  See, e.g., Seekamp v. Michaud,\r\n\n109 \r               F.3d \r                    802, 808 (1st Cir. 1997).  Similarly, with respect to\r\n\nhis   medical  treatment,   plaintiff  has   pointed  to   no\r\n\ncircumstances  that would  permit  a  finding  of  deliberate\r\n\nindifference on the part of defendants.  \r\n\n     For these  reasons, it  \"appears beyond  doubt that  the\r\n\nplaintiff can prove no set  of facts in support of his  claim\r\n\nwhich \r                 would \r                       entitle \r                              him \r                                  to relief.\"  Conley v.
