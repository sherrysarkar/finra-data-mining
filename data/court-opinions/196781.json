Parks  appeal from  the  judgment against  them in\r\n\nfavor of George LaBarre  and Cherline LaBarre.  A  jury found\r\n\nthat   Shepard  and   Parks:  (1)  improperly   and  unfairly\r\n\nforeclosed the mortgage they held on the LaBarres' residence;\r\n\n(2) breached an agreement to avert the foreclosure; committed\r\n\n(3) misrepresentation and  (4) fraud; and  (5) engaged in  an\r\n\nunfair  trade  practice  in  violation   of  New  Hampshire's\r\n\nConsumer Protection  Act.  On appeal, Shepard and Parks raise\r\n\ntwo narrow issues:  first, that admission  of evidence of  an\r\n\nalleged oral agreement, whereby  the LaBarres would deliver a\r\n\ndeed in lieu of foreclosure,  violated the Statute of Frauds;\r\n\nand,  second,  that  the   damages  awarded  were  improperly\r\n\nduplicative.     Disagreeing   with  the   appellants'  first\r\n\ncontention, but agreeing as to the second, we affirm in part,\r\n\nreverse in  part, and  remand for  correction of the  damages\r\n\naward.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          On October 20, 1989, the LaBarres purchased a newly\r\n\nerected house  and surrounding land in  Weare, New Hampshire,\r\n\nfrom Shepard and  Parks, the builders.1   The purchase  price\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  This is a  unusual case.  The record reveals  a number of\r\nanomalies in  the  underlying real  estate  transaction,  the\r\nforeclosure  process, and  the  litigation in  the state  and\r\nfederal trial  courts.  Because none  of these irregularities\r\nis material to the  narrow issues on appeal, we  merely point\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nwas $229,000; the LaBarres paid $11,450 cash and gave Shepard\r\n\nand  Parks  a promissory  note  in  the  amount of  $217,550,\r\n\nsecured by a first mortgage on  the premises.  No payments of\r\n\nprincipal or interest were  due on the note until  either the\r\n\nLaBarres sold certain other real estate or the passage of two\r\n\nyears from the date of the note's execution.2\r\n\n          In  October 1990,  the  LaBarres  sued Shepard  and\r\n\nParks   in   New   Hampshire   state  court   for   defective\r\n\nconstruction,  seeking recision and  money damages.   Shepard\r\n\nand Parks counterclaimed for principal and interest allegedly\r\n\ndue on  the mortgage note.   After  a bench trial,  the court\r\n\ndenied recision,  but found defective construction that would\r\n\ncost  $38,000 to repair.   Accordingly, on June  7, 1993, the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nthem out in footnotes  to help the reader understand  the odd\r\nposture of this case.\r\n\n2.  The promissory  note, while  providing for a  deferral of\r\npayments  for  up  to two  years,  did  not  provide for  any\r\ninstallment payments  thereafter nor  for a  balloon payment.\r\nThe  parties, however, do not raise any issues concerning the\r\nnote and agree on the amount due thereunder.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\ncourt entered  judgment,3 deducting the cost  of repairs from\r\n\nthe mortgage balance.4\r\n\n          In the summer of  1993, Shepard and Parks initiated\r\n\nforeclosure  proceedings against the LaBarres for the balance\r\n\nthen  due  on the  mortgage note.5    A foreclosure  sale was\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  This judgment is impossible to decipher.  The state trial\r\njudge  found that the LaBarres had \"sustained their burden of\r\nproof on their claim of damages\" and \"assessed\" those damages\r\nat  $38,000.    The  judge then  stated  that  \"[d]efendants'\r\ncounterclaim is DENIED without prejudice to assert a separate\r\naction, if necessary.\"  In spite of denying the  counterclaim\r\nfor the mortgage balance due, the judge did not make an award\r\nof  money damages,  but  rather deducted  the $38,000  damage\r\naward from the balance due on the note.  The judge went on to\r\npresent  \"the correct  methodology  for recalculation  of the\r\npromissory note,\" arriving  at a \"[t]otal due under  terms of\r\npromissory  note\" of $239,729.   The decree ended:  \"Judgment\r\nentered in accordance with the foregoing.\"\r\n          Inexplicably, both parties and the magistrate judge\r\nconsider  this to  be a  judgment for  Shepard and  Parks for\r\n$239,729, when  the state court judge  expressly denied their\r                                                                   \r\ncounterclaim.   We ignore  this problem, though,  because the\r\nmagistrate judge  ultimately used the state  court \"judgment\"\r\nto  measure  the  proper  award on  the  mortgage  deficiency\r\ncounterclaim brought  by Shepard and Parks;  hence, there was\r\nno  award on the state judgment itself.  Neither party raises\r\nany question about the state court judgment on appeal.  Given\r\nthis  posture, we too shall refer to the state court mortgage\r\nbalance calculation as a \"judgment,\" though it seems at  best\r\nto be a finding of fact.\r\n\n4.  The balance was recalculated as follows:\r\n\nOriginal Principal balance on mortgage note      $217,500\r\nless: Cost to repair defects                       38,000\r                                                                     \r\nNet principal due on mortgage note               $179,500\r\nplus: Interest due on net principal as of 5/20/93  59,609\r                                                                     \r\nTOTAL DUE AS OF 5/20/93                          $239,109\r\nInterest Per Diem:  $34.32\r\nTOTAL DUE AS OF JUDGMENT DATE 6/7/93             $239,729\r\n\n5.  The  record does  not  reveal whether  Shepard and  Parks\r\ninitiated  the foreclosure  proceedings  before or  after the\r\nentry of the state  court judgment recalculating the mortgage\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nscheduled for September 22, 1993.  At some point prior to the\r\n\nforeclosure sale,  Shepard  and Parks  obtained a  \"drive-by\"\r\n\nappraisal that indicated a fair market value of $150,000, and\r\n\nthe LaBarres were informed of that appraisal.\r\n\n          According  to  the  LaBarres,  their  lawyer orally\r\n\nagreed  with  the  lawyer  for  Shepard  and  Parks that  the\r\n\nLaBarres  would deliver a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and in\r\n\nreturn,  Shepard and  Parks  would credit  the full  $150,000\r\n\nappraised value of the property in determining the deficiency\r\n\nowed under the  state court judgment.   In consideration  for\r\n\nthe agreement,  the LaBarres  allegedly  offered Shepard  and\r\n\nParks access  to their  home for  a more  thorough appraisal.\r\n\nShepard  and Parks  assert that no  such agreement  was made.\r\n\nThere is no written agreement, nor any other writing or notes\r\n\nconcerning the alleged oral agreement between the lawyers.  \r\n\n          The  LaBarres claim to  have been seeking financing\r\n\nto  facilitate a bid on the property at the foreclosure sale,\r\n\nbut say  that they abandoned those efforts when the agreement\r\n\nto deliver the deed  in lieu of foreclosure was reached.  One\r\n\nday  before  the  scheduled foreclosure  sale,  however,  the\r\n\nLaBarres received  a faxed  appraisal from Shepard  and Parks\r\n\nindicating  that the  property was  worth only  $125,000, and\r\n\nthat  they would  give the  LaBarres credit  for 70%  of that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nbalance.   Thus, it is unclear whether the foreclosure was an\r\nattempt to collect on the judgment or the note; we will treat\r\nit as a mortgage foreclosure on the note.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\namount, i.e., $87,500 against the amount  due.6  The LaBarres\r\n\napparently rejected that offer, and the foreclosure sale went\r\n\nahead as scheduled.  The only bidders were Shepard and Parks,\r\n\nwho,  upon  the  advice  of counsel,  jointly  purchased  the\r\n\nproperty for $87,500.\r\n\n          Sometime later, the LaBarres paid Shepard and Parks\r\n\n$17,500  to  obtain the  release  of  an  attachment  on  the\r\n\nLabarres'  property  in  Massachusetts;  this  was  the  only\r\n\npayment made  by the LaBarres  other than their  initial down\r\n\npayment.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                      Proceedings Below\r                                  Proceedings Below\r                                                   \r\n\n          The  LaBarres  brought  this  diversity  action  in\r\n\nfederal district court in  Massachusetts, seeking redress for\r\n\nthe  refusal of Shepard and  Parks to honor  their promise to\r\n\naccept, on terms acceptable  to the LaBarres, a deed  in lieu\r\n\nof  foreclosure.    The LaBarres' complaint,  as amended, was\r\n\nframed in  five counts: (I) unfair  and improper foreclosure,\r\n\n(II) breach of contract, (III) intentional misrepresentation,\r\n\n(IV) fraud, and (V) unfair and deceptive trade practice under\r\n\nNew Hampshire's Consumer Protection Act, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  It is  unclear from  the  record, and  neither party  has\r\nexplained,  whether  the  credit was  to  be  applied  to the\r\noutstanding  balance on  the mortgage  note or  to the  state\r\ncourt judgment.  Given  the cryptic nature of  that judgment,\r\nsee supra note 3,  this lack of precision is  not surprising.\r                     \r\nFor simplicity, we will  speak in terms of credit  toward the\r\nbalance on the mortgage note.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nch.  358-A   (\"RSA  358-A\").    Shepard   and  Parks  brought\r\n\ncounterclaims  for  (I)  the  deficiency  on  the  foreclosed\r\n\nmortgage  and  (II) the  judgment  debt  on the  earlier  New\r\n\nHampshire state court judgment.  \r\n\n          The  parties consented  to  a jury  trial with  the\r\n\nmagistrate judge presiding.   The magistrate judge determined\r\n\nthat the case was  governed by New  Hampshire law.  Prior  to\r\n\ntrial, Shepard  and  Parks moved  in  limine to  exclude  all\r                                                        \r\n\nevidence of  the alleged  oral agreement, which  they claimed\r\n\nwas barred by  New Hampshire's Statute  of Frauds, N.H.  Rev.\r\n\nStat.  Ann.    506:1  (\"RSA  506:1\")  (precluding actions  to\r\n\nenforce  oral contracts  for the  conveyance of  land).   The\r\n\nmagistrate  judge  ruled that  the  statute did  not  bar the\r\n\nLaBarres' breach  of contract  claim.   After the  trial, the\r\n\nmagistrate judge explained that, under New Hampshire law, the\r\n\nStatute of Frauds did not bar a cause of action for breach of\r\n\nan oral settlement agreement between attorneys.\r\n\n          After a  three-day trial in March of 1995, the jury\r\n\nfound for the LaBarres  on all five counts.   Through special\r\n\ninterrogatories, the  jury specifically  found that  the fair\r\n\nmarket value of the  property at the time of  foreclosure was\r\n\n$170,000, and that Shepard and Parks breached an agreement to\r\n\naccept a deed  in return  for credit of  $150,000 toward  the\r\n\nLaBarre's  mortgage obligation.    The jury  also found  that\r\n\nShepard  and  Parks committed  an  unfair  trade practice  in\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nviolation of the Consumer Protection Act, RSA 358-A, and that\r\n\nthe  LaBarres suffered actual damages of $82,500 as a result.\r\n\nAlthough the jury was not asked how it arrived at that actual\r\n\ndamages   figure,  $82,500  is  the  difference  between  the\r\n\nproperty's fair market value of $170,000 and the $87,500 that\r\n\nShepard and Parks bid at the foreclosure sale.  The jury also\r\n\nanswered that  the Consumer Protection Act  damages should be\r\n\ntrebled.7\r\n\n          The magistrate judge directed a verdict for Shepard\r\n\nand Parks on their counterclaims, and then ruled, in essence,\r\n\nthat the  mortgage balance  due, as calculated  in the  state\r\n\ncourt judgment,  was the  proper measure  for a  single, non-\r\n\nduplicative recovery, satisfying both counterclaims.8\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  In his memorandum of decision dated September 5, 1995,\r\nthe magistrate judge explained that, although he should have\r\ndecided whether to double or treble the Consumer Protection\r\nAct damages rather than the jury, Shepard and Parks had\r\nwaived the issue.  Shepard and Parks raised no objection at\r\ntrial, and they now concede that the error has not been\r\npreserved for appeal.  We express no opinion whether the\r\nmultiplication of damages under New Hampshire's Consumer\r\nProtection Act is for the jury or the judge.\r\n\n8.  The special interrogatory form indicated that Shepard and\r\nParks  were entitled to recover on  the state court judgment,\r\nspecifying that amount as $239,109; the actual calculation in\r\nthat  judgment  was  $239,729.    See  supra  note  4.    The\r                                                        \r\ndifference between  the two  figures is the  interest applied\r\nfor the period from  May 20, 1993  (apparently the date of  a\r\nstipulated  interest calculation)  through June 7,  1993 (the\r\ndate of the state  court judgment).  Neither figure  includes\r\ninterest  from mid-1993  through the  March 1995  judgment in\r\nthis case.\r\n          The parties,  however, do  not assert any  error in\r\nthe calculation  of the counterclaim recovery  by Shepard and\r\nParks.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Recognizing that the claims for breach of contract,\r\n\nmisrepresentation,  and fraud  were, in  essence, alternative\r\n\ntheories  of  improper   foreclosure,  the  magistrate  judge\r\n\ntreated   Counts II, III, and IV  as subsumed in Count I, the\r\n\nimproper  foreclosure count.   Rather  than  awarding damages\r\n\noutright  on Count  I, the  magistrate judge  implemented the\r\n\njury's  findings  on Counts  I  through IV  by  crediting the\r\n\nLaBarres  with the full  fair market  value of  the property,\r\n\n$170,000, in  calculating the amount due to Shepard and Parks\r\n\non their counterclaims.\r\n\n          The magistrate judge then awarded treble damages of\r\n\n$247,500 to the LaBarres on  Count V, the Consumer Protection\r\n\nAct   count,   in   accordance  with   the   jury's   special\r\n\ninterrogatory answers.  The judge ruled that although Count V\r\n\nwas \"based on the same factual allegations as were alleged in\r\n\neach of  the other  four counts  of the LaBarres'  Complaint,\r\n\nthey  are entitled to  an independent recovery  under Count V\r\n\nfor  violation  of  the  New  Hampshire  Consumer  Protection\r\n\nstatute.\"    The  magistrate  judge also  awarded  costs  and\r\n\nreasonable  attorney fees to the LaBarres, as provided in the\r\n\nConsumer Protection Act.\r\n\n          Shepard  and  Parks moved  for  a  new trial  under\r\n\nFederal  Rule  of Civil  Procedure 59(a),  to  no avail.   On\r\n\nappeal, Shepard  and  Parks  raise  two of  the  issues  they\r\n\nasserted  in their Rule 59(a) motion.  First, they argue that\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nevidence  of  the alleged  oral  agreement  should have  been\r\n\nexcluded from  trial under  the Statute of  Frauds.   Second,\r\n\nthey maintain  that the award  of damages under  the Consumer\r\n\nProtection  Act must be reduced by $82,500.  They assert that\r\n\nthe award  of full  market value  credit against  the balance\r\n\nowed on  the mortgage note,  in addition to  trebled Consumer\r\n\nProtection Act damages, constituted an improperly duplicative\r\n\nrecovery  because  all  the  counts were  based  on  the same\r\n\nfactual allegations.  In effect, they point out, the LaBarres\r\n\nreceived a quadruple recovery, but were  entitled only to the\r\n\ndamages  under the  largest single  count, i.e.,  the trebled\r\n\nConsumer Protection Act damages.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n1.  The Statute of Frauds\r                                     \r\n\n          The  same factual  allegation  underlies  all  five\r\n\ncounts: Shepard and Parks orally promised to accept a deed in\r\n\nlieu of  foreclosure on terms acceptable to the LaBarres, but\r\n\nthen reneged on that agreement the day before the foreclosure\r\n\nsale.   Shepard and Parks assert that New Hampshire's Statute\r\n\nof Frauds  barred all testimony  and evidence of  the alleged\r\n\noral  agreement.   The  statute,  RSA 506:1,  provides:   \"No\r\n\naction  shall be maintained upon  a contract for  the sale of\r\n\nland unless the agreement  upon which it is brought,  or some\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nmemorandum  thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to\r\n\nbe charged, or by some person authorized by him in writing.\"\r\n\n          Because the  magistrate judge awarded  damages only\r\n\non  Count  I (improper  foreclosure)  and  Count V  (Consumer\r\n\nProtection  Act),   Shepard  and  Parks  recognize  that  the\r\n\njudgment  was not based on enforcement of the contract.  They\r\n\nargue, rather, that the \"entire trial proceeding was tainted\"\r\n\nby  the  introduction  of  evidence of  the  oral  agreement,\r\n\nrequiring reversal.\r\n\n          The  parties agree  that the  Statute of  Frauds is\r\n\napplicable  on its  face to  the  oral agreement  in question\r\n\nhere.   They expend  much energy, however,  disagreeing about\r\n\nwhether  one or more exceptions to the statute apply in these\r\n\nfactual circumstances.   In  doing so,  the parties  miss the\r\n\nreal issue and misunderstand the operation of the Statutes of\r\n\nFrauds.  \r\n\n          There  is no  need  here to  decide the  existence,\r\n\nscope, or applicability of the asserted common-law exceptions\r\n\nto  the Statute  of  Frauds (the  so-called \"oral  settlement\r\n\nagreement   between  attorneys\"   exception  and   the  part-\r\n\nperformance  exception).   We  hold instead  that, under  New\r\n\nHampshire law,  the Statute of  Frauds is  only a bar  to the\r\n\nenforcement  of certain oral contracts;  it is not  a rule of\r\n\nevidence.   Evidence of the  oral agreement in  this case was\r\n\nrelevant  to  the   counts  alleging  improper   foreclosure,\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nmisrepresentation,   fraud,  and  unfair  trade  practice  in\r\n\nviolation  of the Consumer Protection Act.  Shepard and Parks\r\n\nraise  no claim that the Federal Rules of Evidence barred its\r\n\nadmission.  Thus, we find no reversible error.\r\n\n          We find  clear guidance  in New Hampshire  caselaw.\r\n\nThe  New Hampshire Supreme Court held  in Munson v. Raudonis,\r                                                                        \r\n\n387  A.2d 1174, 1176 (N.H. 1978), that the Statute of Frauds,\r\n\nRSA  506:1, did not bar an action  for deceit even though the\r\n\noral promise  that was breached could not be enforced because\r\n\nof  the lack  of a  writing.  In  reaching that  holding, the\r\n\nMunson court expressly rejected  the argument pressed here by\r                  \r\n\nShepard and Parks, i.e., that  evidence of the oral agreement\r\n\nshould  have  been  excluded because  the  four  non-contract\r\n\ncounts  were merely  a  back-door attempt  to circumvent  the\r\n\nStatute  of Frauds.  The court in Munson reasoned as follows:\r                                                    \r\n\n\"Barring an  action  in  deceit because  of  the  Statute  of\r\n\nFrauds, however, would not further the policy of the statute.\r\n\nQuite the contrary,  it would foster an injustice.\"   Id.  In\r                                                                     \r\n\nour view, Munson embodies New Hampshire  law on the question,\r                            \r\n\nand the argument raised by Shepard and Parks  must fail.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso  Morgan v.

Duplicative Damages\r                                  \r\n\n          The jury  found that the  fair market value  of the\r\n\nLaBarres' property  was $170,000 at the  time of foreclosure.\r\n\nAs damages for Counts I through IV, the magistrate judge gave\r\n\nthe LaBarres  credit  for  the  full $170,000  as  an  offset\r\n\nagainst the judgment  for Shepard and  Parks on the  mortgage\r\n\nbalance.  This placed the LaBarres in an even better position\r\n\nthan if they had delivered a deed in lieu of foreclosure  for\r\n\n$150,000  credit,   as  the  parties  had  allegedly  agreed.\r\n\nShepard and Parks have not appealed the award of the $170,000\r\n\ncredit for Counts I through IV.  \r\n\n          Because Shepard  and Parks had bid  only $87,500 at\r\n\nthe foreclosure  sale, the $170,000 credit  is the equivalent\r\n\nof  a damages award of  $82,500, placing the  LaBarres in the\r\n\nposition they would have been in if Shepard and Parks had bid\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nfair market value at the foreclosure.  There is no doubt that\r\n\nthis  award  made the  LaBarres  whole,  or  better, for  the\r\n\nimproper foreclosure.\r\n\n          The  jury  also found  that  the  violation of  the\r\n\nConsumer  Protection  Act by  Shepard  and  Parks caused  the\r\n\nLaBarres actual  damages of  $82,500, which the  jury trebled\r\n\nfor an award of $247,500.  See RSA 358-A:10.  Because the net\r                                          \r\n\neffect of the credit toward the mortgage was to award $82,500\r\n\nabove  the amount bid by  Shepard and Parks,  and because the\r\n\nConsumer Protection  Act award  was for three  times $82,500,\r\n\nthe LaBarres  effectively enjoyed a quadruple  recovery.  The\r\n\nmagistrate  judge  opined  that the  Consumer  Protection Act\r\n\nprovided  an  independent recovery,  and  thus  there was  no\r\n\nimproper duplication.  Shepard and Parks assert that this was\r\n\nerror,  and that the Consumer Protection  Act award should be\r\n\nreduced  by $82,500 to limit the net award to treble damages.\r\n\nWe agree.\r\n\n          It  is evident  from the  record, and  the LaBarres\r\n\nappear to concede, that  the damages under Count  I (improper\r\n\nforeclosure) are based on the same factual allegations as the\r\n\ndamages under Count  V (Consumer Protection Act).   The award\r\n\non  Count I  (in which  all the  four common-law  counts were\r\n\nsubsumed)  was based  on the  $82,500 difference  between the\r\n\nfair  value and  the  bid price;  the  same amount,  $82,500,\r\n\nobviously reflecting  the same  difference  between the  fair\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nvalue  and  the bid,  was awarded  and trebled  (to $247,500)\r\n\nunder the RSA  358-A count.  Nonetheless, the  LaBarres argue\r\n\nthat  this  quadruple award  was  proper  because   they  are\r\n\nentitled to an  \"independent recovery\" under  New Hampshire's\r\n\nConsumer Protection Act.\r\n\n          The  LaBarres, however,  point  to  nothing in  the\r\n\nstatute  or in  any New  Hampshire case  that  supports their\r\n\ncontention  that  the  Consumer  Protection Act  provides  an\r\n\n\"independent  recovery.\"   We  have  found  no New  Hampshire\r\n\nauthority directly on  point, but we  are confident that  New\r\n\nHampshire's Supreme  Court  would  follow  its  general  rule\r\n\nagainst duplicative  recoveries and  would find the  award in\r\n\nthis case erroneous.

Verax Corp.,  637 A.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n906, 912  (N.H. 1994)  (\"[T]he plaintiff  is not  entitled to\r\n\nmultiple  recoveries  for the  same  loss  merely because  he\r\n\nalleged alternative theories of recovery.\"); Clancy v.

Shepard and Thomas M. Parks appeal from the judgment against them in favor of George LaBarre and Cherline LaBarre.   A jury found that Shepard and Parks:  (1) improperly and unfairly foreclosed the mortgage they held on the LaBarres' residence;  (2) breached an agreement to avert the foreclosure;  committed (3) misrepresentation and (4) fraud;  and (5) engaged in an unfair trade practice in violation of New Hampshire's Consumer Protection Act.   On appeal, Shepard and Parks raise two narrow issues:  first, that admission of evidence of an alleged oral agreement, whereby the LaBarres would deliver a deed in lieu of foreclosure, violated the Statute of Frauds;  and, second, that the damages awarded were improperly duplicative.   Disagreeing with the appellants' first contention, but agreeing as to the second, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for correction of the damages award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20, 1989, the LaBarres purchased a newly erected house and surrounding land in Weare, New Hampshire, from Shepard and Parks, the builders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The purchase price was $229,000;  the LaBarres paid $11,450 cash and gave Shepard and Parks a promissory note in the amount of $217,550, secured by a first mortgage on the premises.   No payments of principal or interest were due on the note until either the LaBarres sold certain other real estate or the passage of two years from the date of the note's execution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1990, the LaBarres sued Shepard and Parks in New Hampshire state court for defective construction, seeking recision and money damages.   Shepard and Parks counterclaimed for principal and interest allegedly due on the mortgage note.   After a bench trial, the court denied recision, but found defective construction that would cost $38,000 to repair.   Accordingly, on June 7, 1993, the court entered judgment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> deducting the cost of repairs from the mortgage balance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1993, Shepard and Parks initiated foreclosure proceedings against the LaBarres for the balance then due on the mortgage note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  A foreclosure sale was scheduled for September 22, 1993.   At some point prior to the foreclosure sale, Shepard and Parks obtained a \"drive-by\" appraisal that indicated a fair market value of $150,000, and the LaBarres were informed of that appraisal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the LaBarres, their lawyer orally agreed with the lawyer for Shepard and Parks that the LaBarres would deliver a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and in return, Shepard and Parks would credit the full $150,000 appraised value of the property in determining the deficiency owed under the state court judgment.   In consideration for the agreement, the LaBarres allegedly offered Shepard and Parks access to their home for a more thorough appraisal.   Shepard and Parks assert that no such agreement was made.   There is no written agreement, nor any other writing or notes concerning the alleged oral agreement between the lawyers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LaBarres claim to have been seeking financing to facilitate a bid on the property at the foreclosure sale, but say that they abandoned those efforts when the agreement to deliver the deed in lieu of foreclosure was reached.   One day before the scheduled foreclosure sale, however, the LaBarres received a faxed appraisal from Shepard and Parks indicating that the property was worth only $125,000, and that they would give the LaBarres credit for 70% of that amount, i.e., $87,500 against the amount due.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The LaBarres apparently rejected that offer, and the foreclosure sale went ahead as scheduled.   The only bidders were Shepard and Parks, who, upon the advice of counsel, jointly purchased the property for $87,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime later, the LaBarres paid Shepard and Parks $17,500 to obtain the release of an attachment on the LaBarres' property in Massachusetts;  this was the only payment made by the LaBarres other than their initial down payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LaBarres brought this diversity action in federal district court in Massachusetts, seeking redress for the refusal of Shepard and Parks to honor their promise to accept, on terms acceptable to the LaBarres, a deed in lieu of foreclosure.   The LaBarres' complaint, as amended, was framed in five counts:  (I) unfair and improper foreclosure, (II) breach of contract, (III) intentional misrepresentation, (IV) fraud, and (V) unfair and deceptive trade practice under New Hampshire's Consumer Protection Act, N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. ch.   358-A (\"RSA 358-A\").   Shepard and Parks brought counterclaims for (I) the deficiency on the foreclosed mortgage and (II) the judgment debt on the earlier New Hampshire state court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties consented to a jury trial with the magistrate judge presiding.   The magistrate judge determined that the case was governed by New Hampshire law.   Prior to trial, Shepard and Parks moved in limine to exclude all evidence of the alleged oral agreement, which they claimed was barred by New Hampshire's Statute of Frauds, N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 506:1 (\"RSA 506:1\") (precluding actions to enforce oral contracts for the conveyance of land).   The magistrate judge ruled that the statute did not bar the LaBarres' breach of contract claim.   After the trial, the magistrate judge explained that, under New Hampshire law, the Statute of Frauds did not bar a cause of action for breach of an oral settlement agreement between attorneys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a three-day trial in March of 1995, the jury found for the LaBarres on all five counts.   Through special interrogatories, the jury specifically found that the fair market value of the property at the time of foreclosure was $170,000, and that Shepard and Parks breached an agreement to accept a deed in return for credit of $150,000 toward the LaBarre's mortgage obligation.   The jury also found that Shepard and Parks committed an unfair trade practice in violation of the Consumer Protection Act, RSA 358-A, and that the LaBarres suffered actual damages of $82,500 as a result.   Although the jury was not asked how it arrived at that actual damages figure, $82,500 is the difference between the property's fair market value of $170,000 and the $87,500 that Shepard and Parks bid at the foreclosure sale.   The jury also answered that the Consumer Protection Act damages should be trebled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge directed a verdict for Shepard and Parks on their counterclaims, and then ruled, in essence, that the mortgage balance due, as calculated in the state court judgment, was the proper measure for a single, non-duplicative recovery, satisfying both counterclaims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that the claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation, and fraud were, in essence, alternative theories of improper foreclosure, the magistrate judge treated Counts II, III, and IV as subsumed in Count I, the improper foreclosure count.   Rather than awarding damages outright on Count I, the magistrate judge implemented the jury's findings on Counts I through IV by crediting the LaBarres with the full fair market value of the property, $170,000, in calculating the amount due to Shepard and Parks on their counterclaims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge then awarded treble damages of $247,500 to the LaBarres on Count V, the Consumer Protection Act count, in accordance with the jury's special interrogatory answers.   The judge ruled that although Count V was \"based on the same factual allegations as were alleged in each of the other four counts of the LaBarres' Complaint, they are entitled to an independent recovery under Count V for violation of the New Hampshire Consumer Protection statute.\"   The magistrate judge also awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees to the LaBarres, as provided in the Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shepard and Parks moved for a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a), to no avail.   On appeal, Shepard and Parks raise two of the issues they asserted in their Rule 59(a) motion.   First, they argue that evidence of the alleged oral agreement should have been excluded from trial under the Statute of Frauds.   Second, they maintain that the award of damages under the Consumer Protection Act must be reduced by $82,500.   They assert that the award of full market value credit against the balance owed on the mortgage note, in addition to trebled Consumer Protection Act damages, constituted an improperly duplicative recovery because all the counts were based on the same factual allegations.   In effect, they point out, the LaBarres received a quadruple recovery, but were entitled only to the damages under the largest single count, i.e., the trebled Consumer Protection Act damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p>1. The Statute of Frauds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same factual allegation underlies all five counts:  Shepard and Parks orally promised to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure on terms acceptable to the LaBarres, but then reneged on that agreement the day before the foreclosure sale.   Shepard and Parks assert that New Hampshire's Statute of Frauds barred all testimony and evidence of the alleged oral agreement.   The statute, RSA 506:1, provides:  \"No action shall be maintained upon a contract for the sale of land unless the agreement upon which it is brought, or some memorandum thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be charged, or by some person authorized by him in writing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the magistrate judge awarded damages only on Count I (improper foreclosure) and Count V (Consumer Protection Act), Shepard and Parks recognize that the judgment was not based on enforcement of the contract.   They argue, rather, that the \"entire trial proceeding was tainted\" by the introduction of evidence of the oral agreement, requiring reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that the Statute of Frauds is applicable on its face to the oral agreement in question here.   They expend much energy, however, disagreeing about whether one or more exceptions to the statute apply in these factual circumstances.   In doing so, the parties miss the real issue and misunderstand the operation of the Statutes of Frauds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no need here to decide the existence, scope, or applicability of the asserted common-law exceptions to the Statute of Frauds (the so-called \"oral settlement agreement between attorneys\" exception and the part-performance exception).   We hold instead that, under New Hampshire law, the Statute of Frauds is only a bar to the enforcement of certain oral contracts;  it is not a rule of evidence.   Evidence of the oral agreement in this case was relevant to the counts alleging improper foreclosure, misrepresentation, fraud, and unfair trade practice in violation of the Consumer Protection Act.   Shepard and Parks raise no claim that the Federal Rules of Evidence barred its admission.   Thus, we find no reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find clear guidance in New Hampshire caselaw.   The New Hampshire Supreme Court held in Munson v. Raudonis, 118 N.H. 474, 387 A.2d 1174, 1176 (1978), that the Statute of Frauds, RSA 506:1, did not bar an action for deceit even though the oral promise that was breached could not be enforced because of the lack of a writing.   In reaching that holding, the Munson court expressly rejected the argument pressed here by Shepard and Parks, i.e., that evidence of the oral agreement should have been excluded because the four non-contract counts were merely a back-door attempt to circumvent the Statute of Frauds.   The court in Munson reasoned as follows:  \"Barring an action in deceit because of the Statute of Frauds, however, would not further the policy of the statute.   Quite the contrary, it would foster an injustice.\"  Id.  In our view, Munson embodies New Hampshire law on the question, and the argument raised by Shepard and Parks must fail.   See also Morgan v. Morgan, 94 N.H. 116, 47 A.2d 569, 571 (1946) (Statute of Frauds did not bar action for misrepresentation even if agreement was unenforceable as a contract).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Restatement (Second) of Contracts, a source often relied upon by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, provides additional support for this result.   See, e.g., Tsiatsios v. Tsiatsios, 140 N.H. 173, 663 A.2d 1335, 1339 (1995) (following the Restatement);  Patch v. Arsenault, 139 N.H. 313, 653 A.2d 1079, 1082 (1995) (same);  Simpson v. Calivas, 139 N.H. 1, 650 A.2d 318, 327 (1994) (same).   Section 143 of the Restatement provides that \"[t]he Statute of Frauds does not make an unenforceable contract inadmissible in evidence for any purpose other than its enforcement in violation of the statute.\"   Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 143 (1981).   The Comment to Section 143 explains that \"the Statute, despite occasional statements to the contrary, does not lay down a rule of evidence, and an unenforceable contract may be proved for any legitimate purpose.\"  Id. &#167; 143 cmt. a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It does not matter that the magistrate judge's reason for admitting evidence of the alleged oral agreement was his conclusion that a purported \"lawyer's settlement agreement\" exception (or alternatively, the part-performance exception) put the agreement outside the Statute of Frauds.   While we are skeptical whether that conclusion was correct, we can affirm the admission of evidence on any proper basis, even if the trial judge relied on a different ground.   See United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1127 (1st Cir.1989) (no reversal where trial court admits evidence on an incorrect basis, if properly admissible for same purpose under different rule of evidence), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1005, 110 S.Ct. 1300, 108 L.Ed.2d 477 (1990);  cf. Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201, 204 (1st Cir.1994) (appellate court free to affirm the district court's judgment on any independently sufficient ground manifest in the record).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the evidence of the alleged oral agreement was admissible for purposes other than enforcing that agreement, i.e., to prove the four non-contract counts, and because the breach of contract count did not affect the judgment, there is no reversible error in the magistrate judge's ruling on the applicability of the Statute of Frauds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Duplicative Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found that the fair market value of the LaBarres' property was $170,000 at the time of foreclosure.   As damages for Counts I through IV, the magistrate judge gave the LaBarres credit for the full $170,000 as an offset against the judgment for Shepard and Parks on the mortgage balance.   This placed the LaBarres in an even better position than if they had delivered a deed in lieu of foreclosure for $150,000 credit, as the parties had allegedly agreed.   Shepard and Parks have not appealed the award of the $170,000 credit for Counts I through IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Shepard and Parks had bid only $87,500 at the foreclosure sale, the $170,000 credit is the equivalent of a damages award of $82,500, placing the LaBarres in the position they would have been in if Shepard and Parks had bid fair market value at the foreclosure.   There is no doubt that this award made the LaBarres whole, or better, for the improper foreclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also found that the violation of the Consumer Protection Act by Shepard and Parks caused the LaBarres actual damages of $82,500, which the jury trebled for an award of $247,500.   See RSA 358-A:10.   Because the net effect of the credit toward the mortgage was to award $82,500 above the amount bid by Shepard and Parks, and because the Consumer Protection Act award was for three times $82,500, the LaBarres effectively enjoyed a quadruple recovery.   The magistrate judge opined that the Consumer Protection Act provided an independent recovery, and thus there was no improper duplication.   Shepard and Parks assert that this was error, and that the Consumer Protection Act award should be reduced by $82,500 to limit the net award to treble damages.   We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is evident from the record, and the LaBarres appear to concede, that the damages under Count I (improper foreclosure) are based on the same factual allegations as the damages under Count V (Consumer Protection Act).   The award on Count I (in which all the four common-law counts were subsumed) was based on the $82,500 difference between the fair value and the bid price;  the same amount, $82,500, obviously reflecting the same difference between the fair value and the bid, was awarded and trebled (to $247,500) under the RSA 358-A count.   Nonetheless, the LaBarres argue that this quadruple award was proper because they are entitled to an \"independent recovery\" under New Hampshire's Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LaBarres, however, point to nothing in the statute or in any New Hampshire case that supports their contention that the Consumer Protection Act provides an \"independent recovery.\"   We have found no New Hampshire authority directly on point, but we are confident that New Hampshire's Supreme Court would follow its general rule against duplicative recoveries and would find the award in this case erroneous.   See Phillips v. Verax Corp., 138 N.H. 240, 637 A.2d 906, 912 (1994) (\"[T]he plaintiff is not entitled to multiple recoveries for the same loss merely because he alleged alternative theories of recovery.\");  Clancy v. State, 104 N.H. 314, 185 A.2d 261, 263 (1962) (\"Duplication of damages should be avoided.\");  Burke v. Burnham, 97 N.H. 203, 84 A.2d 918, 922 (1951) (recovery of same damages under two causes of action impermissible).   We hold that the award in this case was duplicative, and that the LaBarres' recovery may not exceed the treble damages allowable under the Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LaBarres argue that a Massachusetts decision affirming a damage award under the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, supports by analogy the magistrate judge's award in this case.   The cited case, Multi Technology, Inc. v. Mitchell Management Sys., Inc., 25 Mass.App.Ct. 333, 518 N.E.2d 854, 857, review denied, 402 Mass. 1101, 521 N.E.2d 398 (1988), does not, however, provide any support.   The plaintiffs in Multi Technology received Consumer Protection Act damages in addition to contract damages because the separate counts entailed factually separate items of damage.  Id.  The plaintiff had agreed to a reduced fee based on the defendant's misrepresentations.   Accordingly, the court awarded the agreed amount as contract damages, and also awarded the difference between the plaintiff's standard fee and the agreed-upon reduced fee as Consumer Protection Act damages.  Id.  Here, there are no factually separate items of damage, and the holding in Multi Technology is inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the LaBarres' assertions and their misleading citation of Multi Technology, the quadruple recovery in this case is clearly improper under Massachusetts law, as well as New Hampshire law.   In Calimlim v. Foreign Car Ctr., Inc., 392 Mass. 228, 467 N.E.2d 443, 448 (1984), the Supreme Judicial Court held that \"[w]here injury is incurred because of conduct which comprises the elements of any common law, statutory, or regulatory cause of action, and which is also a violation of the Consumer Protection Act, recovery of cumulative damages under multiple counts may not be allowed.\"   The reasoning and holding in Calimlim would unquestionably bar the cumulative recovery in this case, where the factual allegations and the items of actual damages are identical under the common law and Consumer Protection Act counts.  Id.;  see also Lexton-Ancira Real Estate Fund, 1972 v. Heller, 826 P.2d 819, 822-24 (Colo.1992) (en banc) (no double recovery for violation of Colorado Consumer Protection Act and common law misappropriation arising out of same set of facts, and collecting cases with similar holdings in other states).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we hold that the LaBarres were improperly awarded quadruple damages, when they were entitled to no more than treble damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed in part, and reversed in part.   The damages awarded to the LaBarres shall be reduced by $82,500, and any interest awarded on the judgment shall be adjusted accordingly.   The case is remanded to the magistrate judge for entry of a corrected damages award consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This is a unusual case.   The record reveals a number of anomalies in the underlying real estate transaction, the foreclosure process, and the litigation in the state and federal trial courts.   Because none of these irregularities is material to the narrow issues on appeal, we merely point them out in footnotes to help the reader understand the odd posture of this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The promissory note, while providing for a deferral of payments for up to two years, did not provide for any installment payments thereafter nor for a balloon payment.

The state trial judge found that the LaBarres had \"sustained their burden of proof on their claim of damages\" and \"assessed\" those damages at $38,000.   The judge then stated that \"[d]efendants' counterclaim is DENIED without prejudice to assert a separate action, if necessary.\"   In spite of denying the counterclaim for the mortgage balance due, the judge did not make an award of money damages, but rather deducted the $38,000 damage award from the balance due on the note.   The judge went on to present \"the correct methodology for recalculation of the promissory note,\" arriving at a \"[t]otal due under terms of promissory note\" of $239,729.   The decree ended:  \"Judgment entered in accordance with the foregoing.\"</p>\n        <p>Inexplicably, both parties and the magistrate judge consider this to be a judgment for Shepard and Parks for $239,729, when the state court judge expressly denied their counterclaim.   We ignore this problem, though, because the magistrate judge ultimately used the state court \"judgment\" to measure the proper award on the mortgage deficiency counterclaim brought by Shepard and Parks;  hence, there was no award on the state judgment itself.   Neither party raises any question about the state court judgment on appeal.   Given this posture, we too shall refer to the state court mortgage balance calculation as a \"judgment,\" though it seems at best to be a finding of fact.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The balance was recalculated as follows:</p>\n        <pre>Original Principal balance on mortgage note         $217,500\nless: Cost to repair defects                          38,000\n                                                    --------\nNet principal due on mortgage note                  $179,500\nplus: Interest due on net principal as of 5/20/93     59,609\n                                                    --------\nTOTAL DUE AS OF 5/20/93                             $239,109\nInterest Per Diem: $34.32\nTOTAL DUE AS OF JUDGMENT DATE 6/7/93                $239,729</pre>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The record does not reveal whether Shepard and Parks initiated the foreclosure proceedings before or after the entry of the state court judgment recalculating the mortgage balance.

Shepard and Thomas M. Parks appeal from the judgment against them in favor of George LaBarre and Cherline LaBarre.   A jury found that Shepard and Parks:  (1) improperly and unfairly foreclosed the mortgage they held on the LaBarres' residence;  (2) breached an agreement to avert the foreclosure;  committed (3) misrepresentation and (4) fraud;  and (5) engaged in an unfair trade practice in violation of New Hampshire's Consumer Protection Act.   On appeal, Shepard and Parks raise two narrow issues:  first, that admission of evidence of an alleged oral agreement, whereby the LaBarres would deliver a deed in lieu of foreclosure, violated the Statute of Frauds;  and, second, that the damages awarded were improperly duplicative.   Disagreeing with the appellants' first contention, but agreeing as to the second, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for correction of the damages award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20, 1989, the LaBarres purchased a newly erected house and surrounding land in Weare, New Hampshire, from Shepard and Parks, the builders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The purchase price was $229,000;  the LaBarres paid $11,450 cash and gave Shepard and Parks a promissory note in the amount of $217,550, secured by a first mortgage on the premises.   No payments of principal or interest were due on the note until either the LaBarres sold certain other real estate or the passage of two years from the date of the note's execution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1990, the LaBarres sued Shepard and Parks in New Hampshire state court for defective construction, seeking recision and money damages.   Shepard and Parks counterclaimed for principal and interest allegedly due on the mortgage note.   After a bench trial, the court denied recision, but found defective construction that would cost $38,000 to repair.   Accordingly, on June 7, 1993, the court entered judgment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> deducting the cost of repairs from the mortgage balance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1993, Shepard and Parks initiated foreclosure proceedings against the LaBarres for the balance then due on the mortgage note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  A foreclosure sale was scheduled for September 22, 1993.   At some point prior to the foreclosure sale, Shepard and Parks obtained a \"drive-by\" appraisal that indicated a fair market value of $150,000, and the LaBarres were informed of that appraisal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the LaBarres, their lawyer orally agreed with the lawyer for Shepard and Parks that the LaBarres would deliver a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and in return, Shepard and Parks would credit the full $150,000 appraised value of the property in determining the deficiency owed under the state court judgment.   In consideration for the agreement, the LaBarres allegedly offered Shepard and Parks access to their home for a more thorough appraisal.   Shepard and Parks assert that no such agreement was made.   There is no written agreement, nor any other writing or notes concerning the alleged oral agreement between the lawyers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LaBarres claim to have been seeking financing to facilitate a bid on the property at the foreclosure sale, but say that they abandoned those efforts when the agreement to deliver the deed in lieu of foreclosure was reached.   One day before the scheduled foreclosure sale, however, the LaBarres received a faxed appraisal from Shepard and Parks indicating that the property was worth only $125,000, and that they would give the LaBarres credit for 70% of that amount, i.e., $87,500 against the amount due.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The LaBarres apparently rejected that offer, and the foreclosure sale went ahead as scheduled.   The only bidders were Shepard and Parks, who, upon the advice of counsel, jointly purchased the property for $87,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime later, the LaBarres paid Shepard and Parks $17,500 to obtain the release of an attachment on the LaBarres' property in Massachusetts;  this was the only payment made by the LaBarres other than their initial down payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LaBarres brought this diversity action in federal district court in Massachusetts, seeking redress for the refusal of Shepard and Parks to honor their promise to accept, on terms acceptable to the LaBarres, a deed in lieu of foreclosure.   The LaBarres' complaint, as amended, was framed in five counts:  (I) unfair and improper foreclosure, (II) breach of contract, (III) intentional misrepresentation, (IV) fraud, and (V) unfair and deceptive trade practice under New Hampshire's Consumer Protection Act, N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. ch.   358-A (\"RSA 358-A\").   Shepard and Parks brought counterclaims for (I) the deficiency on the foreclosed mortgage and (II) the judgment debt on the earlier New Hampshire state court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties consented to a jury trial with the magistrate judge presiding.   The magistrate judge determined that the case was governed by New Hampshire law.   Prior to trial, Shepard and Parks moved in limine to exclude all evidence of the alleged oral agreement, which they claimed was barred by New Hampshire's Statute of Frauds, N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 506:1 (\"RSA 506:1\") (precluding actions to enforce oral contracts for the conveyance of land).   The magistrate judge ruled that the statute did not bar the LaBarres' breach of contract claim.   After the trial, the magistrate judge explained that, under New Hampshire law, the Statute of Frauds did not bar a cause of action for breach of an oral settlement agreement between attorneys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a three-day trial in March of 1995, the jury found for the LaBarres on all five counts.   Through special interrogatories, the jury specifically found that the fair market value of the property at the time of foreclosure was $170,000, and that Shepard and Parks breached an agreement to accept a deed in return for credit of $150,000 toward the LaBarre's mortgage obligation.   The jury also found that Shepard and Parks committed an unfair trade practice in violation of the Consumer Protection Act, RSA 358-A, and that the LaBarres suffered actual damages of $82,500 as a result.   Although the jury was not asked how it arrived at that actual damages figure, $82,500 is the difference between the property's fair market value of $170,000 and the $87,500 that Shepard and Parks bid at the foreclosure sale.   The jury also answered that the Consumer Protection Act damages should be trebled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge directed a verdict for Shepard and Parks on their counterclaims, and then ruled, in essence, that the mortgage balance due, as calculated in the state court judgment, was the proper measure for a single, non-duplicative recovery, satisfying both counterclaims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that the claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation, and fraud were, in essence, alternative theories of improper foreclosure, the magistrate judge treated Counts II, III, and IV as subsumed in Count I, the improper foreclosure count.   Rather than awarding damages outright on Count I, the magistrate judge implemented the jury's findings on Counts I through IV by crediting the LaBarres with the full fair market value of the property, $170,000, in calculating the amount due to Shepard and Parks on their counterclaims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge then awarded treble damages of $247,500 to the LaBarres on Count V, the Consumer Protection Act count, in accordance with the jury's special interrogatory answers.   The judge ruled that although Count V was \"based on the same factual allegations as were alleged in each of the other four counts of the LaBarres' Complaint, they are entitled to an independent recovery under Count V for violation of the New Hampshire Consumer Protection statute.\"   The magistrate judge also awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees to the LaBarres, as provided in the Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shepard and Parks moved for a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a), to no avail.   On appeal, Shepard and Parks raise two of the issues they asserted in their Rule 59(a) motion.   First, they argue that evidence of the alleged oral agreement should have been excluded from trial under the Statute of Frauds.   Second, they maintain that the award of damages under the Consumer Protection Act must be reduced by $82,500.   They assert that the award of full market value credit against the balance owed on the mortgage note, in addition to trebled Consumer Protection Act damages, constituted an improperly duplicative recovery because all the counts were based on the same factual allegations.   In effect, they point out, the LaBarres received a quadruple recovery, but were entitled only to the damages under the largest single count, i.e., the trebled Consumer Protection Act damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p>1. The Statute of Frauds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same factual allegation underlies all five counts:  Shepard and Parks orally promised to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure on terms acceptable to the LaBarres, but then reneged on that agreement the day before the foreclosure sale.   Shepard and Parks assert that New Hampshire's Statute of Frauds barred all testimony and evidence of the alleged oral agreement.   The statute, RSA 506:1, provides:  \"No action shall be maintained upon a contract for the sale of land unless the agreement upon which it is brought, or some memorandum thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be charged, or by some person authorized by him in writing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the magistrate judge awarded damages only on Count I (improper foreclosure) and Count V (Consumer Protection Act), Shepard and Parks recognize that the judgment was not based on enforcement of the contract.   They argue, rather, that the \"entire trial proceeding was tainted\" by the introduction of evidence of the oral agreement, requiring reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that the Statute of Frauds is applicable on its face to the oral agreement in question here.   They expend much energy, however, disagreeing about whether one or more exceptions to the statute apply in these factual circumstances.   In doing so, the parties miss the real issue and misunderstand the operation of the Statutes of Frauds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no need here to decide the existence, scope, or applicability of the asserted common-law exceptions to the Statute of Frauds (the so-called \"oral settlement agreement between attorneys\" exception and the part-performance exception).   We hold instead that, under New Hampshire law, the Statute of Frauds is only a bar to the enforcement of certain oral contracts;  it is not a rule of evidence.   Evidence of the oral agreement in this case was relevant to the counts alleging improper foreclosure, misrepresentation, fraud, and unfair trade practice in violation of the Consumer Protection Act.   Shepard and Parks raise no claim that the Federal Rules of Evidence barred its admission.   Thus, we find no reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find clear guidance in New Hampshire caselaw.   The New Hampshire Supreme Court held in Munson v. Raudonis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2171736\"><a href=\"/opinion/2171736/munson-v-raudonis/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></span>, 1176 (1978), that the Statute of Frauds, RSA 506:1, did not bar an action for deceit even though the oral promise that was breached could not be enforced because of the lack of a writing.   In reaching that holding, the Munson court expressly rejected the argument pressed here by Shepard and Parks, i.e., that evidence of the oral agreement should have been excluded because the four non-contract counts were merely a back-door attempt to circumvent the Statute of Frauds.   The court in Munson reasoned as follows:  \"Barring an action in deceit because of the Statute of Frauds, however, would not further the policy of the statute.   Quite the contrary, it would foster an injustice.\"  Id.  In our view, Munson embodies New Hampshire law on the question, and the argument raised by Shepard and Parks must fail.   See also Morgan v.

The Comment to Section 143 explains that \"the Statute, despite occasional statements to the contrary, does not lay down a rule of evidence, and an unenforceable contract may be proved for any legitimate purpose.\"  Id. &#167; 143 cmt. a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It does not matter that the magistrate judge's reason for admitting evidence of the alleged oral agreement was his conclusion that a purported \"lawyer's settlement agreement\" exception (or alternatively, the part-performance exception) put the agreement outside the Statute of Frauds.   While we are skeptical whether that conclusion was correct, we can affirm the admission of evidence on any proper basis, even if the trial judge relied on a different ground.   See United States v.

Duplicative Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found that the fair market value of the LaBarres' property was $170,000 at the time of foreclosure.   As damages for Counts I through IV, the magistrate judge gave the LaBarres credit for the full $170,000 as an offset against the judgment for Shepard and Parks on the mortgage balance.   This placed the LaBarres in an even better position than if they had delivered a deed in lieu of foreclosure for $150,000 credit, as the parties had allegedly agreed.   Shepard and Parks have not appealed the award of the $170,000 credit for Counts I through IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Shepard and Parks had bid only $87,500 at the foreclosure sale, the $170,000 credit is the equivalent of a damages award of $82,500, placing the LaBarres in the position they would have been in if Shepard and Parks had bid fair market value at the foreclosure.   There is no doubt that this award made the LaBarres whole, or better, for the improper foreclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also found that the violation of the Consumer Protection Act by Shepard and Parks caused the LaBarres actual damages of $82,500, which the jury trebled for an award of $247,500.   See RSA 358-A:10.   Because the net effect of the credit toward the mortgage was to award $82,500 above the amount bid by Shepard and Parks, and because the Consumer Protection Act award was for three times $82,500, the LaBarres effectively enjoyed a quadruple recovery.   The magistrate judge opined that the Consumer Protection Act provided an independent recovery, and thus there was no improper duplication.   Shepard and Parks assert that this was error, and that the Consumer Protection Act award should be reduced by $82,500 to limit the net award to treble damages.   We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is evident from the record, and the LaBarres appear to concede, that the damages under Count I (improper foreclosure) are based on the same factual allegations as the damages under Count V (Consumer Protection Act).   The award on Count I (in which all the four common-law counts were subsumed) was based on the $82,500 difference between the fair value and the bid price;  the same amount, $82,500, obviously reflecting the same difference between the fair value and the bid, was awarded and trebled (to $247,500) under the RSA 358-A count.   Nonetheless, the LaBarres argue that this quadruple award was proper because they are entitled to an \"independent recovery\" under New Hampshire's Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LaBarres, however, point to nothing in the statute or in any New Hampshire case that supports their contention that the Consumer Protection Act provides an \"independent recovery.\"   We have found no New Hampshire authority directly on point, but we are confident that New Hampshire's Supreme Court would follow its general rule against duplicative recoveries and would find the award in this case erroneous.

We hold that the award in this case was duplicative, and that the LaBarres' recovery may not exceed the treble damages allowable under the Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LaBarres argue that a Massachusetts decision affirming a damage award under the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, supports by analogy the magistrate judge's award in this case.   The cited case, Multi Technology, Inc. v. Mitchell Management Sys., Inc., 25 Mass.App.Ct. 333, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2020149\"><a href=\"/opinion/2020149/multi-technology-v-mitchell-management-sys/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span>, 857, review denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1101</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></span> (1988), does not, however, provide any support.   The plaintiffs in Multi Technology received Consumer Protection Act damages in addition to contract damages because the separate counts entailed factually separate items of damage.  Id.  The plaintiff had agreed to a reduced fee based on the defendant's misrepresentations.   Accordingly, the court awarded the agreed amount as contract damages, and also awarded the difference between the plaintiff's standard fee and the agreed-upon reduced fee as Consumer Protection Act damages.  Id.  Here, there are no factually separate items of damage, and the holding in Multi Technology is inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the LaBarres' assertions and their misleading citation of Multi Technology, the quadruple recovery in this case is clearly improper under Massachusetts law, as well as New Hampshire law.   In Calimlim v. Foreign Car Ctr., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2027194\"><a href=\"/opinion/2027194/calimlim-v-foreign-car-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2027194\"><a href=\"/opinion/2027194/calimlim-v-foreign-car-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 448 (1984), the Supreme Judicial Court held that \"[w]here injury is incurred because of conduct which comprises the elements of any common law, statutory, or regulatory cause of action, and which is also a violation of the Consumer Protection Act, recovery of cumulative damages under multiple counts may not be allowed.\"   The reasoning and holding in Calimlim would unquestionably bar the cumulative recovery in this case, where the factual allegations and the items of actual damages are identical under the common law and Consumer Protection Act counts.  Id.;  see also Lexton-Ancira Real Estate Fund, 1972 v. Heller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1249614\"><a href=\"/opinion/1249614/lexton-ancira-real-estate-fund-v-heller/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span>, 822-24 (Colo.1992) (en banc) (no double recovery for violation of Colorado Consumer Protection Act and common law misappropriation arising out of same set of facts, and collecting cases with similar holdings in other states).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we hold that the LaBarres were improperly awarded quadruple damages, when they were entitled to no more than treble damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed in part, and reversed in part.   The damages awarded to the LaBarres shall be reduced by $82,500, and any interest awarded on the judgment shall be adjusted accordingly.   The case is remanded to the magistrate judge for entry of a corrected damages award consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This is a unusual case.   The record reveals a number of anomalies in the underlying real estate transaction, the foreclosure process, and the litigation in the state and federal trial courts.   Because none of these irregularities is material to the narrow issues on appeal, we merely point them out in footnotes to help the reader understand the odd posture of this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The promissory note, while providing for a deferral of payments for up to two years, did not provide for any installment payments thereafter nor for a balloon payment.   The parties, however, do not raise any issues concerning the note and agree on the amount due thereunder</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This judgment is impossible to decipher.   The state trial judge found that the LaBarres had \"sustained their burden of proof on their claim of damages\" and \"assessed\" those damages at $38,000.   The judge then stated that \"[d]efendants' counterclaim is DENIED without prejudice to assert a separate action, if necessary.\"   In spite of denying the counterclaim for the mortgage balance due, the judge did not make an award of money damages, but rather deducted the $38,000 damage award from the balance due on the note.   The judge went on to present \"the correct methodology for recalculation of the promissory note,\" arriving at a \"[t]otal due under terms of promissory note\" of $239,729.   The decree ended:  \"Judgment entered in accordance with the foregoing.\"</p>\n        <p>Inexplicably, both parties and the magistrate judge consider this to be a judgment for Shepard and Parks for $239,729, when the state court judge expressly denied their counterclaim.   We ignore this problem, though, because the magistrate judge ultimately used the state court \"judgment\" to measure the proper award on the mortgage deficiency counterclaim brought by Shepard and Parks;  hence, there was no award on the state judgment itself.   Neither party raises any question about the state court judgment on appeal.   Given this posture, we too shall refer to the state court mortgage balance calculation as a \"judgment,\" though it seems at best to be a finding of fact.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The balance was recalculated as follows:</p>\n        <pre>Original Principal balance on mortgage note         $217,500\nless: Cost to repair defects                          38,000\n                                                    --------\nNet principal due on mortgage note                  $179,500\nplus: Interest due on net principal as of 5/20/93     59,609\n                                                    --------\nTOTAL DUE AS OF 5/20/93                             $239,109\nInterest Per Diem: $34.32\nTOTAL DUE AS OF JUDGMENT DATE 6/7/93                $239,729</pre>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The record does not reveal whether Shepard and Parks initiated the foreclosure proceedings before or after the entry of the state court judgment recalculating the mortgage balance.   Thus, it is unclear whether the foreclosure was an attempt to collect on the judgment or the note;  we will treat it as a mortgage foreclosure on the note</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> It is unclear from the record, and neither party has explained, whether the credit was to be applied to the outstanding balance on the mortgage note or to the state court judgment.

For simplicity, we will speak in terms of credit toward the balance on the mortgage note</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In his memorandum of decision dated September 5, 1995, the magistrate judge explained that, although he should have decided whether to double or treble the Consumer Protection Act damages rather than the jury, Shepard and Parks had waived the issue.   Shepard and Parks raised no objection at trial, and they now concede that the error has not been preserved for appeal.   We express no opinion whether the multiplication of damages under New Hampshire's Consumer Protection Act is for the jury or the judge</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The special interrogatory form indicated that Shepard and Parks were entitled to recover on the state court judgment, specifying that amount as $239,109;  the actual calculation in that judgment was $239,729.   See supra note 4.   The difference between the two figures is the interest applied for the period from May 20, 1993 (apparently the date of a stipulated interest calculation) through June 7, 1993 (the date of the state court judgment).   Neither figure includes interest from mid-1993 through the March 1995 judgment in this case</p>\n        <p>The parties, however, do not assert any error in the calculation of the counterclaim recovery by Shepard and Parks.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
