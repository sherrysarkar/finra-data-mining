P. 33,  on  the basis  of  newly\r\n\ndiscovered evidence,  and for  a correction of  his sentence,\r\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 35.  We affirm  the decisions of\r\n\nthe district court.\r\n\n     Having carefully  reviewed the  record in this  case, we\r\n\nfind  no  abuse of  the  district court's  discretion  in its\r\n\nimplicit  determination that  the allegedly  newly discovered\r\n\nevidence presented by appellant was of insufficient weight to\r\n\nsustain his burden of showing that  it would \"probably result\r\n\nin an  acquittal  upon retrial  of  the defendant.\"    United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

This\r\n\nargument is without merit since there is no evidence that the\r\n\ndistrict court was influenced by the government's calculation\r\n\nwhen the  court imposed  its sentence in  this pre-Guidelines\r\n\ncase.  Appellant's other  arguments regarding sentencing were\r\n\nnot  raised in  the  district court  and  hence will  not  be\r\n\nconsidered on appeal.  United States v.
