This case arises out\r\n\nof a speculative investment that went bad. Plaintiff Stephen\r\n\nA. Palmacci invested $75,000 in a project, known as \"the Chase\r\n\nproject,\" to purchase and develop distressed real estate. He\r\n\nhad heard that the defendant's brother, Gus Umpierrez, who was\r\n\na real estate agent and knowledgeable in real estate matters,\r\n\nhad \"turned a pretty fast profit\" on similar ventures, and he\r\n\nwanted to reap some of the same type of profits.\r\n\n          Palmacci acknowledges that he understood the risks\r\n\ninherent in any investment and, in particular, the increased\r\n\nrisk involved in the speculative type of investment in which he\r\n\nwas getting involved. He claims that he took this risk because\r\n\nhis friend P. Fernando Umpierrez (\"Umpierrez\"), the defendant,\r\n\nand Umpierrez's brother, Gus, promised to invest $75,000 of\r\n\ntheir own personal funds in the project. According to\r\n\nPalmacci's testimony, he \"decided that if they thought it was\r\n\nworth the risk with the knowledge that Gus had, that [Palmacci]\r\n\nwould do the same.\" Palmacci also claims that he relied on the\r\n\nrepresentation that project funds would be placed in a trust,\r\n\nwhich he believed would reduce the chance of \"things going\r\n\nbad.\" The project failed (for reasons that are not set forth\r\n\nin the record), and Palmacci received only 80% of his principal\r\n\nback. \r\n\n          Umpierrez filed a petition for bankruptcy protection\r\n\nunder Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nPalmacci filed an adversary proceeding pursuant to 11 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 523 (a)(2)(A), claiming that the debt owed him should not be\r\n\ndischarged because it was the product of false representations.\r\n\nThe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New\r\n\nHampshire held a trial in the matter, and at the close of the\r\n\nplaintiff's evidence, entered a judgment as a matter of law in\r\n\nfavor of the debtor, holding that the debt was dischargeable\r\n\nin bankruptcy. This ruling was affirmed by the United States\r\n\nDistrict Court for the District of New Hampshire. We affirm.\r\n\n          A court reviewing a decision of the bankruptcy court\r\n\nmay not set aside findings of fact unless they are clearly\r\n\nerroneous, giving \"due regard . . . to the opportunity of the\r\n\nbankruptcy court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\"\r\n\nFed. R. Bankr. P. 8013;   see Commerce \r                                                    Bank \r                                                         &amp;  \r                                                            Trust \r                                                                  Co.  \r                                                                       v.\r\n\nBurgess \r                    (In \r                        re \r                           Burgess), 955 F.2d 134, 137 (1st Cir. 1992);\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 52(c), advisory committee's note to 1991\r\n\nAmendment (applying clearly erroneous standard in the case of\r\n\na judgment on partial findings). The bankruptcy court's legal\r\n\nconclusions, drawn from the facts so found, are reviewed de\r\n\nnovo. Martin v. Bajgar (In re Bajgar)\r                                                 , 104 F.3d 495, 497 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1997). Although the district court has already reviewed\r\n\nthe bankruptcy court's decision, on appeal we independently\r\n\n1.  The trial court styled its ruling as the grant of\r\ndefendant's motion for a directed verdict. In essence,\r\nhowever, the ruling was a judgment as a matter of law on\r\npartial findings. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052; Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n52(c). We will treat it as such.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nreview that decision, applying the same standard of review that\r\n\nthe district court applied. See \r                                            In re Bajgar\r                                                       , 104 F.3d at 497;\r\n\nIn \r               re \r                  G.S.F. \r                         Corp., 938 F.2d 1467, 1474 (1st Cir. 1991). No\r\n\nspecial deference is owed to the district court's\r\n\ndeterminations.  Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d\r\n\n26, 30 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          A finding of fact is clearly erroneous, although\r\n\nthere is evidence to support it, when the reviewing court,\r\n\nafter carefully examining all the evidence, is \"left with the\r\n\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\r\n\ncommitted.\"  Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564,\r\n\n573 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). Deference to\r\n\nthe bankruptcy court's factual findings is particularly\r\n\nappropriate on the intent issue \"[b]ecause a determination\r\n\nconcerning fraudulent intent depends largely upon an assessment\r\n\nof the credibility and demeanor of the debtor.\" \r                                                           In re Burgess\r                                                                        ,\r\n\n955 F.2d at 137 (internal quotation marks omitted) (applying\r\n\nS 727(a), relating to fraud by the debtor in representations in\r\n\nthe course of the court proceeding). Particular deference is\r\n\nalso due to the trial court's findings that depend on the\r\n\ncredibility of other witnesses and on the weight to be accorded\r\n\nto such testimony.   See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8013;   Keller \r                                                                       v.\r\n\nUnited \r                   States, 38 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir. 1994). Of course, a\r\n\ntrial court may not\r\n\n          insulate [its] findings from review by\r\n          denominating them credibility\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          determinations, for factors other than\r\n          demeanor and inflection go into the\r\n          decision whether or not to believe a\r\n          witness. Documents or objective evidence\r\n          may contradict the witness' story; or the\r\n          story itself may be so internally\r\n          inconsistent or implausible on its face\r\n          that a reasonable factfinder would not\r\n          credit it. Where such factors are\r\n          present, the court of appeals may well\r\n          find clear error even in a finding\r\n          purportedly based on a credibility\r\n          determination.\r\n\nAnderson, 470 U.S. at 575. \r\n\n          Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code\r\n\nprovides:\r\n\n          S 523. Exceptions to discharge\r\n\n          (a) A discharge under section 727, 1141,\r\n          1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b) of this title\r\n          does not discharge an individual debtor\r\n          from any debt -- \r\n\n          (2) for money, property, services, or an\r\n          extension, renewal, or refinancing of\r\n          credit, to the extent obtained by --\r\n\n          (A) false pretenses, a false\r\n          representation, or actual fraud, other\r\n          than a statement respecting the debtor's\r\n          or an insider's financial condition.\r\n\nSee 11 U.S.C. S 523(a)(2)(A).\r\n\n          \"Exceptions to discharge are narrowly construed in\r\n\nfurtherance of the Bankruptcy Code's 'fresh start' policy,\"\r\n\nand, for that reason, the claimant must show that his \"claim\r\n\ncomes squarely within an exception enumerated in Bankruptcy\r\n\nCode S 523(a).\" Century 21 Balfour Real Estate v. Menna (In re\r\n\nMenna), 16 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1994);  see In \r                                                          re \r                                                             Bajgar, 104\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nF.3d at 498 n.1. The statutory requirements for a discharge\r\n\nare \"construed liberally in favor of the debtor\" and \"[t]he\r\n\nreasons for denying a discharge to a bankrupt must be real and\r\n\nsubstantial, not merely technical and conjectural.\" Boroff v.\r\n\nTully  \r                  (In  \r                       re  \r                           Tully), 818 F.2d 106, 110 (1st Cir. 1987)\r\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). On the other hand, we have\r\n\nnoted that \"the very purpose of certain sections of the law,\r\n\nlike [S 727(a)(2)], is to make certain that those who seek the\r\n\nshelter of the bankruptcy code do not play fast and loose with\r\n\ntheir assets or with the reality of their affairs.\"       Id.\r\n\nLikewise, other sections of the law, like S 523(a)(2)(A), are\r\n\nintended to make certain that bankruptcy protection is not\r\n\nafforded to debtors who have obtained property by means of a\r\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation.\r\n\n          Palmacci alleges that Umpierrez made three\r\n\nmisrepresentations which induced him to invest $75,000 in the\r\n\nproject: (1) that Umpierrez and his brother would invest\r\n\n$75,000 of their own money in the project; (2) that the project\r\n\nwould have a total investment of $250,000; and (3) that a trust\r\n\nwould be established to hold the funds and to supervise the\r\n\nproject. \r\n\n          With respect to each of these three claims, Palmacci\r\n\nwas required to establish both that he had a valid claim\r\n\nagainst Umpierrez and that the claim should not be discharged\r\n\nin bankruptcy. See \r                               Grogan v. Garner\r                                              , 498 U.S. 279, 283 (1991).\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nHere, the claim and the reason for exemption from discharge are\r\n\nessentially the same: the common law        tort of false\r\n\nrepresentation, also known as deceit. \r\n\n          Under the traditional common law rule, a defendant\r\n\nwill be liable if (1) he makes a false representation, (2) he\r\n\ndoes so with fraudulent intent, i.e., with \"scienter,\" (3) he\r\n\nintends to induce the plaintiff to rely on the\r\n\nmisrepresentation, and (4) the misrepresentation does induce\r\n\nreliance, (5) which is justifiable, and (6) which causes damage\r\n\n(pecuniary loss). 2 F. Harper, et al., Law of Torts\r                                                                S 7.1, at\r\n\n381 (2d ed. 1986); Restatement (Second) of Torts S 525 (1977).\r\n\n          Regarding the first element, the concept of\r\n\nmisrepresentation includes a false representation as to one's\r\n\nintention, such as a promise to act. \"A representation of the\r\n\nmaker's own intention to do . . . a particular thing is\r\n\nfraudulent if he does not have that intention\" at the time he\r\n\n2.

Ct. 437, 443 &amp; n.9 (1995), the\r\nCourt construed S 523(a)(2)(A) to incorporate the \"general\r\ncommon law of torts,\" i.e., the \"dominant consensus of common-\r\nlaw jurisdictions, rather than the law of any particular\r\nState.\" Of course, if we were to hold that Umpierrez was not\r\nentitled to discharge them in bankruptcy, Palmacci's claims\r\nthemselves would be determined in accordance with the common\r\nlaw of New Hampshire.\r\n\n3.  We set forth a similar, but not identical, list of elements\r\nin In \r                  re \r                     Burgess, 955 F.2d at 140. We interpret   Burgess to\r\napply the same test we have articulated in the text here,\r\nexcept for the fifth element. In Burgess our reliance element\r\nrequired \"reasonable\" reliance, but the Supreme Court has since\r\nheld that \"justifiable\" reliance is the proper test.      See\r\nField, 116 S.

Thus, if Palmacci failed to\r\n\nestablish any one of the elements by a preponderance of the\r\n\nevidence, then the court should reject his claim.  See In \r                                                                       re\r\n\nBurgess, 955 F.2d at 139; 9A Wright &amp; Miller, \r                                                        supra, S 2579, at\r\n\n542-43 (a factual finding that negates one element of the\r\n\nplaintiff's prima facie case renders findings concerning other\r\n\nelements unnecessary).\r\n\n          We will discuss each of Palmacci's three\r\n\nmisrepresentation claims in turn. First, Palmacci claims that\r\n\nUmpierrez falsely represented that he and his brother would\r\n\ninvest $75,000 of their own personal funds into the Chase\r\n\nproject. Umpierrez responds that he made good on his\r\n\nrepresentation because he did contribute $75,000 of his own\r\n\npersonal funds, albeit by giving the bank a lien on the Chase\r\n\nproject property as well as a second mortgage on his home.\r\n\nAccording to Umpierrez, encumbering the project property does\r\n\nnot mean that he failed to satisfy his promise to contribute\r\n\nfunds personally, because he never told Palmacci that he would\r\n\nnot mortgage the Chase project property. The district court\r\n\nagreed with Umpierrez: it found that there was no\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                         11\r\r\n\nmisrepresentation because \"there was no representation that a\r\n\nmortgage would not be placed on the project.\" We find this\r\n\nargument untenable. An ordinary lay person like Palmacci would\r\n\nnot think, nor would it be reasonable to expect him to think,\r\n\nthat Umpierrez's representation that he would invest \"his own\r\n\npersonal funds\" in the Chase project could be read to include\r\n\nfunds he borrowed from a bank secured by a mortgage on the\r\n\nproject property itself. Thus, Umpierrez cannot claim that\r\n\nthere was no misrepresentation.\r\n\n          Umpierrez is more persuasive in contending that\r\n\nPalmacci's first claim fails on the element of scienter or\r\n\nfraudulent intent which is required in order to establish an\r\n\nexception to discharge under S 523(a)(2)(A). See 2 Harper, et\r\n\nal., \r                supra, S 7.1, at 381; Restatement (Second) of Torts S 525.\r\n\nPalmacci does not dispute that Umpierrez intended to obtain\r\n\nmost of the funds for his contribution to the project from a\r\n\nsecond mortgage on his residence. Palmacci's argument, in\r\n\nessence, is that, at the time Umpierrez induced Palmacci's\r\n\ninvestment with the promise to invest his own personal funds,\r\n\nUmpierrez's intention was fraudulent, based on a reckless\r\n\nindifference to the truth (which rose to the level of\r\n\nfraudulent intent) because Umpierrez knew or should have known\r\n\nthat he did not have enough equity in the house to raise the\r\n\nmoney through a second mortgage, at least without encumbering\r\n\nthe project property with a mortgage as well. \r\n\n                            -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\n          We must parse this issue with some care. The factual\r\n\nquestion to be determined by the trier of fact is not whether\r\n\nUmpierrez knew or should have known that he did not have the\r\n\nmoney available to invest, but whether in good faith he\r\n\nintended to keep his promise. This is because \"[a] finding\r\n\nthat a debt is non-dischargeable under 523(a)(2)(A) requires a\r\n\nshowing of actual or positive fraud, not merely fraud implied\r\n\nby law\r                 .\"  In re Anastas\r                                  , 94 F.3d at 1286 &amp; n.3 (emphasis added)\r\n\n(quoting 124 Cong.

Where this conclusion is reached as an\r\n\ninference of fact, there is nothing inconsistent with that\r\n\nunreasonableness forming an evidentiary basis for a finding of\r\n\nintent.   See Keeton, et al.,    supra, at 742.

The\r\n\nfocus, however, should be on whether the surrounding\r\n\ncircumstances or the debtor's actions \"appear so inconsistent\r\n\nwith [his] self-serving statement of intent that the proof\r\n\nleads the court to disbelieve the debtor.\" \r                                                      In re Hunt\r                                                                , 30 B.R.\r\n\n425, 441 (Bankr.

In\r\n\nre  \r               Cohn, 54 F.3d at 1118-19 (S 523(a)(2)(B)). Among the\r\n\ncircumstances from which scienter may be inferred are: the\r\n\ndefendant's insolvency or some other reason to know that he\r\n\ncannot pay, his repudiation of the promise soon after made, or\r\n\nhis failure even to attempt any performance. Keeton, et al.,\r\n\nsupra, at 764-65. \r\n\n          Where, as here, reckless disregard is being urged\r\n\nupon us as the basis for an inference of scienter, it is\r\n\nimportant to distinguish what the debtor is being accused of\r\n\nrecklessly disregarding. Scienter may be found to exist where\r\n\na debtor recklessly disregards the truth of the representation,\r\n\ne.g., in Umpierrez's case, whether he was recklessly\r\n\nindifferent to whether he would actually keep his promise to\r\n\ninvest personal funds in the Chase project.  See Restatement\r\n\n(Second) of Torts S 526 cmt. e. There must, nonetheless, be an\r\n\nactual finding of intent to deceive: mere inability to pay\r\n\ndoes not constitute such a finding. \r                                               See \r                                                   In re Anastas\r                                                                , 94 F.3d\r\n\nat 1286 (\"[T]he hopeless state of a debtor's financial\r\n\ncondition should never become a substitute for an actual\r\n\nfinding of bad faith.\"). This distinction is apparent from the\r\n\nstructure of the statute itself: 11 U.S.C. S 523(a)(2)(A)\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                         15\r\r\n\nspecifically excludes misrepresentations regarding a debtor's\r\n\nfinancial condition, whereas 11 U.S.C. S 523(a)(2)(B) provides\r\n\nseparately for such misrepresentations. Thus, to the extent\r\n\nPalmacci is claiming that Umpierrez implicitly misrepresented\r\n\nhis financial condition, that is not grounds for an exception\r\n\nto discharge under S 523(a)(2)(A).\r\n\n          In the instant case, if Umpierrez knew or clearly\r\n\nshould have known that there was no realistic way for him to\r\n\nuse his own money to invest, then that is probative of his lack\r\n\nof intent to keep his promise at the time he made the promise.\r\n\nBut the focus must be on whether the representation was made in\r\n\nbad faith, i.e., whether he induced Palmacci's investment with\r\n\nthe intention of reneging on his promise to invest personal\r\n\nfunds (or while recklessly disregarding whether or not he would\r\n\nkeep his promise).  See In \r                                       re \r                                          Anastas, 94 F.3d at 1286 (debt\r\n\nincurred with the intention of avoiding the debt by petitioning\r\n\nfor bankruptcy). \r\n\n          Palmacci contends that the court erred by relying\r\n\nexclusively on Umpierrez's self-serving testimony about his\r\n\nsubjective intent, and failing to consider the surrounding\r\n\ncircumstances in order to infer that Umpierrez's intent was not\r\n\nas he claimed it to be. We do not think Palmacci is correct in\r\n\ncharacterizing the trial court's reasoning as relying solely on\r\n\nUmpierrez's self-serving testimony while ignoring the\r\n\ncircumstantial evidence Palmacci contends shows that testimony\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                         16\r\r\n\nto be incredible. It is true that Umpierrez had just purchased\r\n\nthe residence a few months earlier, for $105,000 and that he\r\n\nhad an $80,000 mortgage on the residence at the time of\r\n\npurchase. Based on this undisputed fact, Palmacci claims that\r\n\nUmpierrez should have known that he only had $25,000 worth of\r\n\nequity in the home, against which he could borrow on a second\r\n\nmortgage without a likely encumbrance of the project property,\r\n\nand therefore that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in\r\n\nbelieving Umpierrez's testimony that, at the time he made his\r\n\npromise, he fully intended to keep it. Umpierrez's claim that\r\n\nan innocent lack of knowledge of these facts (and not a\r\n\nfraudulent intent) caused him to err when he promised to\r\n\ncontribute the $75,000 arguably falls into the category of\r\n\n\"reckless disregard for the truth\" such as to rise to the level\r\n\nof establishing scienter.\r\n\n          These were not, however, the only facts before the\r\n\ntrial court. There was also testimony that Umpierrez had\r\n\ndiscussed getting a personal loan with a banker, and that the\r\n\nbanker had told him he thought the loan would be possible.\r\n\nMoreover, Umpierrez testified that he had had the house\r\n\nappraised in October (shortly before the representation that\r\n\ninduced Palmacci to invest his money) and the house was valued\r\n\nat $185,000, more than enough to secure a loan for the full\r\n\n4.  In addition, the Umpierrezes' share would include the\r\n$5,000 down payment they invested at the time of the purchase\r\nat auction. \r\n\n                            -17-\r                                         17\r\r\n\namount of Umpierrez's promised contribution. Thus, even though\r\n\nUmpierrez did not have a commitment letter from the bank -- a\r\n\nfact that Palmacci emphasizes -- he could well have honestly\r\n\nbelieved that he could work something out with the bank whereby\r\n\nthe bank could protect its security needs without encumbering\r\n\nthe project property and therefore without rendering his\r\n\nrepresentation to Palmacci fraudulent. The court's decision\r\n\nmentioned this possible interpretation, noting that the market\r\n\nvalue of the house in early November (when Palmacci was induced\r\n\nto make his investment in the Chase project) was not\r\n\nnecessarily limited to the price that Umpierrez paid when he\r\n\nbought it in July.\r\n\n          Absent a showing to the contrary, and bearing in mind\r\n\nthat the burden of proof was on Palmacci, we must assume that\r\n\nthe trial court considered all the testimony (and other\r\n\nevidence before it) in its entirety, as well as all reasonable\r\n\ninferences therefrom, before making its determination that\r\n\nUmpierrez did not intend to defraud Palmacci at the time he\r\n\npromised to contribute $75,000 of his personal funds to the\r\n\nproject. We perforce reject Palmacci's claim that the court\r\n\nrelied exclusively on Umpierrez's testimony and failed to\r\n\nconsider the surrounding circumstances.\r\n\n          Moreover, while Palmacci is correct that intent to\r\n\ndeceive may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances,\r\n\nincluding inferences from circumstantial facts, \r                                                           see \r                                                               Desmond v.\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                         18\r\r\n\nVarrasso \r                     (In \r                         re \r                            Varrasso), 37 F.3d 760, 764 (1st Cir. 1994),\r\n\nscienter cannot be presumed, \r                                        id. at 764-65; \r                                                      In re Cohn\r                                                                , 54 F.3d\r\n\nat 1120. \"The mere breach of a promise is not enough in itself\r\n\nto establish the fraudulent intent.\" Keeton, et al.,   supra,\r\n\nS 108, at 764.\r\n\n          Thus, although the evidence here might \"support the\r\n\nbankruptcy court's decision had it inferred an intent to\r\n\ndeceive from the circumstantial evidence admitted in this case,\r\n\n[it does] not compel such a finding and [does] not require us\r\n\nto reverse the court's holding.\" National Union Fire Ins.

Where there are two\r\n          permissible views of the evidence, the\r\n          factfinder's choice between them cannot be\r\n          clearly erroneous.\r\n\nAnderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. at 573-74.\r\n\n          In the instant case, Umpierrez testified that he\r\n\nthought he would be able to come up with his $75,000 investment\r\n\nfrom his personal funds, and the judge believed him, apparently\r\n\ntaking into account all circumstances including the weight of\r\n\nthe alleged unreasonableness of his belief. The bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt found, as a matter of fact, that Umpierrez did not intend\r\n\nto defraud Palmacci when he promised to contribute $75,000 of\r\n\nhis own personal funds to the project. In the context of the\r\n\nrecord in this case, we read this as a determination that there\r\n\nwas no scienter, i.e., that there was no knowing\r\n\nmisrepresentation and no reckless disregard for the truth such\r\n\nas would rise to the level of fraudulent intent. After\r\n\ncarefully reviewing the record in its entirety, we conclude\r\n\nthat there is sufficient evidence for the trial court to have\r\n\nconcluded that Umpierrez's intent was not fraudulent. We\r\n\ncannot say the trial court clearly erred in its choice of which\r\n\ninferences to draw from the evidence presented to it.\r\n\n                            -20-\r                                         20\r\r\n\nTherefore we affirm the court's rejection of the first alleged\r\n\nmisrepresentation claim.\r\n\n          Palmacci's second claim is that Umpierrez\r\n\nmisrepresented to him that the project would have a total\r\n\ncapital contribution of $250,000. This claim is derivative\r\n\nfrom the first: to whatever extent Umpierrez fell short on his\r\n\ncontribution of $75,000, there would result a like shortfall in\r\n\nthe total project capitalization. Palmacci does not make any\r\n\nargument as to his second claim that differs from his arguments\r\n\non the first claim. Therefore, our rejection of the second\r\n\nflows ineluctably from our conclusion as to the first. \r\n\n          Palmacci's third claim is that Umpierrez\r\n\nmisrepresented the role of the trust that was created in\r\n\nconnection with the Chase project. According to Palmacci's\r\n\nbrief, Umpierrez represented that \"the project was to be held\r\n\nin trust supervised by a New Hampshire attorney.\" Palmacci\r\n\nconcedes that a trust was indeed set up after he made his\r\n\ninvestment, but he argues that \"[t]he reality of the situation\r\n\nwas that the trust had no role to play in the supervision of\r\n\nthe project.\" Palmacci does not make it clear exactly what was\r\n\nallegedly represented to him regarding the trust's supervision\r\n\n5.  Palmacci also argues that the bankruptcy court erred in\r\nholding that he was not justified in relying on Umpierrez's\r\nrepresentations. We need not decide this issue because, having\r\nfailed to meet his burden on the intent element, it does not\r\navail him that he may have met the remaining elements; he must\r\nsatisfy all requirements in order to establish his claim.\r\n\n                            -21-\r                                         21\r\r\n\nof the Chase project. In his brief he seems to imply that\r\n\nUmpierrez actually told him the trust would supervise the\r\n\ninvestment project itself (as opposed to being simply a vehicle\r\n\nfor controlling the flow of funds). Scrutiny of Palmacci's\r\n\nfactual assertions, however, in his testimony and in the\r\n\nfactual portion of his brief, reveal a claim merely that\r\n\nPalmacci's \"idea of the role of the trust\" was that the trustee\r\n\nwould be responsible for and control how funds were used by the\r\n\nbuilders. Because of this \"idea,\" Palmacci \"felt assured\" that\r\n\nthe project \"would be supervised correctly, and there was less\r\n\nchance of things going bad.\" Palmacci did not testify as to\r\n\nthe basis for his subjective understanding. For all we know,\r\n\nthe basis could have been merely that Palmacci himself thought\r\n\na trust always does so supervise, without any representation by\r\n\nUmpierrez beyond the mere creation of a trust.\r\n\n          The bankruptcy court dismissed the trust issue on the\r\n\nground that Palmacci could not have \"justifiably relied\" on the\r\n\nrole of the trust as supervising the real estate project. The\r\n\ncourt reasoned that the trust was not established until\r\n\nNovember 11, 1991, several days after November 7, when Palmacci\r\n\nmade his investment, so Palmacci could not have known the terms\r\n\nof the trust instrument and therefore could not have been\r\n\njustified in relying on any such terms. (The district court\r\n\ndecision did not specifically address the alleged\r\n\nmisrepresentation regarding the role of the trust.) \r\n\n                            -22-\r                                         22\r\r\n\n          Palmacci is correct that the bankruptcy court's\r\n\nanalysis is flawed. Even if the trust was not actually created\r\n\nuntil after he invested his money, Palmacci could conceivably\r\n\nhave relied on verbal (or written) representations from\r\n\nUmpierrez -- made on or before November 7 -- as to how the\r\n\ntrust would be structured or what its role would be once the\r\n\ntrust was created. And it might well have been justifiable for\r\n\nPalmacci to rely on such representations regardless of whether\r\n\nthe trust instrument had yet been drafted. If such\r\n\nrepresentations were false and made with scienter, then this\r\n\nthird claim could not be dismissed based on the trial court's\r\n\nreasoning.\r\n\n          Nevertheless, we will affirm a correct result reached\r\n\nby the court below \"on any independently sufficient ground made\r\n\nmanifest by the record.\"  AIDS Action Comm. of Mass. v. MBTA,\r\n\n42 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks\r\n\nomitted). Although the bankruptcy court's stated reason for\r\n\nrejecting Palmacci's argument concerning the establishment of\r\n\na trust was based on flawed reasoning, its conclusion was\r\n\ncorrect. Our review of the record, including Palmacci's own\r\n\ntestimony, reveals absolutely no evidence clearly indicating\r\n\nthat Umpierrez's statements or actions were the basis for\r\n\nPalmacci's subjective \"idea\" or feeling that the trust would\r\n\nsupervise the project. Indeed, as the bankruptcy court pointed\r\n\nout, the attorney who drew up the trust testified that the\r\n\n                            -23-\r                                         23\r\r\n\nconcept of a trust was not even discussed by the investors\r\n\nbefore Palmacci invested his money in the project. Thus, the\r\n\nonly representation that is supportable on this record is that\r\n\na trust would be created and that the trustee would be an\r\n\nattorney. This much was indisputably carried out. It is not\r\n\nenough for Palmacci to testify that his \"idea of the role of\r\n\nthe trust\" was to supervise the operation of the project,\r\n\nwithout specifying the source of this idea. Because the record\r\n\nis devoid of evidence that would support a finding that a\r\n\nmisrepresentation was made on the trust issue, we need not\r\n\nconsider the dispute as to whether Palmacci was justified in\r\n\nrelying on any alleged representation about the role of the\r\n\ntrust.\r\n\n          Finally, Palmacci alleges that the bankruptcy court\r\n\nerred as a matter of law when it restricted the testimony of\r\n\nPalmacci's expert witness to events that took place only prior\r\n\nto or soon after the transaction at issue. A trial court has\r\n\nwide discretion in determining the admissibility of expert\r\n\ntestimony, especially where the issue is being tried directly\r\n\nto the bench.

Williamson v. Busconi, 87 F.3d 602, 603 n.1 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1996). The trial court's decision will be \"sustained\r\n\nunless [its] discretion has been abused.\"  Allied \r                                                              Int'l, 814\r\n\nF.2d at 40.\r\n\n          In the instant case, the trial judge had heard\r\n\ntestimony from the creditor, the debtor, and the attorney for\r\n\nthe real estate project (who drew up the trust), as well as\r\n\nsome of the testimony of the expert in dispute (i.e., that part\r\n\nof the expert's testimony relating to events that took place\r\n\nprior to or soon after Palmacci's investment in the project).\r\n\nThe portion of the expert's proffered testimony that the court\r\n\nexcluded related to whether, when the trust was dissolved in\r\n\n1993, Umpierrez \"received a disproportionate return on his\r\n\ninvestment, compared to other investors, which would be to the\r\n\ndetriment of Mr. Palmacci.\" \r\n\n          Palmacci acknowledges, as we discussed \r                                                            supra at 7-9,\r\n\nthat the alleged fraud must exist at the inception of the debt,\r\n\nand statements or actions which were neither false nor\r\n\nfraudulent when made will not be made so by the happening of\r\n\nsubsequent events. Nor does failure to carry out one's\r\n\nintentions constitute a basis for finding a debt\r\n\nnondischargeable under S 523(a)(2)(A) absent a showing that the\r\n\nclaimed fraud existed at the inception of the debt. \r\n\n          Palmacci argues, however, that a promissor's\r\n\nsubsequent conduct may reflect his state of mind at the time he\r\n\n                            -25-\r                                         25\r\r\n\nmade the promise, and thus may be considered in determining\r\n\nwhether he possessed the requisite fraudulent intent \r                                                               ab initio\r                                                                        .\r\n\nIt is true that subsequent conduct may be relevant to an\r\n\nearlier state of mind. In  Williamson \r                                                  v. \r                                                     Busconi, 87 F.3d at\r\n\n603, we concluded that the bankruptcy court abused its\r\n\ndiscretion by excluding evidence as to conduct \r                                                          subsequent to a\r\n\nreal estate closing, from which a factfinder reasonably could\r\n\nhave inferred that Busconi had not intended to pay the note \r                                                                       at\r\n\nthe time\r                    it was executed. The lower court in \r                                                        Busconi said this\r\n\nevidence was irrelevant, and then expressly credited Busconi's\r\n\ntestimony (although Williamson testified too). Finding that\r\n\nWilliamson had failed to establish the requisite fraudulent\r\n\nintent, the bankruptcy court ruled the debt dischargeable. \r                                                                      Id.\r\n\n          We rejected that reasoning, noting that: \r\n\n          As direct evidence is seldom available,\r\n          fraudulent intent normally is determined\r\n          from the totality of the circumstances.\r\n          And since \"subsequent conduct may reflect\r\n          back to the promissor's state of mind and\r\n          thus may be considered in ascertaining\r\n          whether there was fraudulent intent\" at\r\n          the time the promise was made, proper\r\n          application of the \"totality\" test in this\r\n          context often warrants consideration of\r\n          post-transaction conduct and\r\n          contemporaneous events.\r\n\nId. at 603 (citation omitted) (quoting \r                                                 Krenowsky v.

The court reasonably concluded that the\r\n\ndebtor's fraudulent scheme began prior to the debt in dispute,\r\n\nand continued throughout the period. Similarly, in   Comerica\r\n\nBank v. Weinhardt (In re Weinhardt)\r                                              , 156 B.R. 677, 680 (Bankr.\r\n\nM.D. Fla. 1993), the business into which the debtor was to have\r\n\ninvested the creditor's funds never existed, and the debtor\r\n\nspent all the money on a gambling spree. The court concluded\r\n\nthat evidence of the subsequent pattern of conduct helped to\r\n\nshow that the debtor did not, even at the outset, intend to use\r\n\nthe funds obtained for the purposes stated. \r\n\n          In the instant case, the disputed testimony simply\r\n\ndoes not rise to the same level of probative value on the issue\r\n\nof Umpierrez's intent to defraud in the inducement. The\r\n\nproffered testimony related to events almost two years after\r\n\nPalmacci's investment was induced. Moreover, the allegations\r\n\n6.  The timing and other aspects of relevance were not\r\ndelineated in our opinion in Busconi. There we simply stated\r\nthat the proffered evidence of subsequent conduct was evidence\r\n\"from which a factfinder reasonably could have inferred that\r\nBusconi had not intended to pay the note at the time it was\r\nexecuted.\" 87 F.3d at 603. A similar conclusion cannot be\r\ndrawn in the instant case.\r\n\n                            -27-\r                                         27\r\r\n\nPalmacci sought to prove through his proffered expert -- that\r\n\nthe losses on the investment were not proportionately shared\r\n\nand that the project's 1992 and 1993 financial statements\r\n\nindicated that Umpierrez did not spend all project money\r\n\nexactly as originally stated in the business proposal (although\r\n\nthey did not indicate that he failed to apply the funds to the\r\n\nChase project in some way) -- would not have been directly\r\n\nprobative of Umpierrez's intent to deceive in 1991. Certainly\r\n\nthe bankruptcy court, which heard all the evidence, did not\r\n\nabuse its discretion in refusing to hear the proffered expert\r\n\ntestimony.\r\n\n          Even if we were to conclude on the present facts that\r\n\nthe bankruptcy court erred in excluding the expert testimony,\r\n\nwe need not reverse on this issue because excluding this\r\n\nevidence did not affect Palmacci's substantial rights.    See\r\n\nBusconi, 87 F.2d at 603. In order to win a reversal, an\r\n\nappellant who claims error in the admissibility of evidence\r\n\nmust also show that the evidentiary ruling adversely affected\r\n\nhis \"substantial rights.\"  See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9005, 9017\r\n\n(incorporating Fed. R. Civ. P. 61; Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)).\r\n\nHere, as in Busconi, \"[i]n light of all the evidence in the\r\n\nrecord, we are not persuaded that the challenged judgment was\r\n\nsubstantially influenced by the [presumptively] erroneous\r\n\nevidentiary ruling.\" Busconi, 87 F.2d at 603 (citing \r                                                                 Lubanski\r\n\nv.

Palmacci had hoped to \"turn[] a\r\n\npretty fast profit on it,\" as he had seen Gus Umpierrez do on\r\n\nprior real estate deals. At the same time, Palmacci understood\r\n\nthat he was taking a risk; he might not only not make a \"fast\r\n\nprofit\" but he might lose money on the deal. Now that the\r\n\nproject has gone sour, Palmacci cannot prevent Umpierrez from\r\n\ndischarging his debts in bankruptcy unless he demonstrates all\r\n\nthe elements of fraud or false representation. He has failed\r\n\nto meet this burden with respect to at least one element of\r\n\neach of the three misrepresentations that he has alleged.\r\n\nAccordingly, the judgment is \r                                        affirmed.

This case arises out\r\n\nof a speculative investment that went bad. Plaintiff Stephen\r\n\nA. Palmacci invested $75,000 in a project, known as \"the Chase\r\n\nproject,\" to purchase and develop distressed real estate. He\r\n\nhad heard that the defendant's brother, Gus Umpierrez, who was\r\n\na real estate agent and knowledgeable in real estate matters,\r\n\nhad \"turned a pretty fast profit\" on similar ventures, and he\r\n\nwanted to reap some of the same type of profits.\r\n\n          Palmacci acknowledges that he understood the risks\r\n\ninherent in any investment and, in particular, the increased\r\n\nrisk involved in the speculative type of investment in which he\r\n\nwas getting involved. He claims that he took this risk because\r\n\nhis friend P. Fernando Umpierrez (\"Umpierrez\"), the defendant,\r\n\nand Umpierrez's brother, Gus, promised to invest $75,000 of\r\n\ntheir own personal funds in the project. According to\r\n\nPalmacci's testimony, he \"decided that if they thought it was\r\n\nworth the risk with the knowledge that Gus had, that [Palmacci]\r\n\nwould do the same.\" Palmacci also claims that he relied on the\r\n\nrepresentation that project funds would be placed in a trust,\r\n\nwhich he believed would reduce the chance of \"things going\r\n\nbad.\" The project failed (for reasons that are not set forth\r\n\nin the record), and Palmacci received only 80% of his principal\r\n\nback. \r\n\n          Umpierrez filed a petition for bankruptcy protection\r\n\nunder Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nPalmacci filed an adversary proceeding pursuant to 11 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 523 (a)(2)(A), claiming that the debt owed him should not be\r\n\ndischarged because it was the product of false representations.\r\n\nThe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New\r\n\nHampshire held a trial in the matter, and at the close of the\r\n\nplaintiff's evidence, entered a judgment as a matter of law in\r\n\nfavor of the debtor, holding that the debt was dischargeable\r\n\nin bankruptcy. This ruling was affirmed by the United States\r\n\nDistrict Court for the District of New Hampshire. We affirm.\r\n\n          A court reviewing a decision of the bankruptcy court\r\n\nmay not set aside findings of fact unless they are clearly\r\n\nerroneous, giving \"due regard . . . to the opportunity of the\r\n\nbankruptcy court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\"\r\n\nFed.

First, Palmacci claims that\r\n\nUmpierrez falsely represented that he and his brother would\r\n\ninvest $75,000 of their own personal funds into the Chase\r\n\nproject. Umpierrez responds that he made good on his\r\n\nrepresentation because he did contribute $75,000 of his own\r\n\npersonal funds, albeit by giving the bank a lien on the Chase\r\n\nproject property as well as a second mortgage on his home.\r\n\nAccording to Umpierrez, encumbering the project property does\r\n\nnot mean that he failed to satisfy his promise to contribute\r\n\nfunds personally, because he never told Palmacci that he would\r\n\nnot mortgage the Chase project property. The district court\r\n\nagreed with Umpierrez: it found that there was no\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                         11\r\r\n\nmisrepresentation because \"there was no representation that a\r\n\nmortgage would not be placed on the project.\" We find this\r\n\nargument untenable. An ordinary lay person like Palmacci would\r\n\nnot think, nor would it be reasonable to expect him to think,\r\n\nthat Umpierrez's representation that he would invest \"his own\r\n\npersonal funds\" in the Chase project could be read to include\r\n\nfunds he borrowed from a bank secured by a mortgage on the\r\n\nproject property itself. Thus, Umpierrez cannot claim that\r\n\nthere was no misrepresentation.\r\n\n          Umpierrez is more persuasive in contending that\r\n\nPalmacci's first claim fails on the element of scienter or\r\n\nfraudulent intent which is required in order to establish an\r\n\nexception to discharge under S 523(a)(2)(A). See 2 Harper, et\r\n\nal., \r                supra, S 7.1, at 381; Restatement (Second) of Torts S 525.\r\n\nPalmacci does not dispute that Umpierrez intended to obtain\r\n\nmost of the funds for his contribution to the project from a\r\n\nsecond mortgage on his residence. Palmacci's argument, in\r\n\nessence, is that, at the time Umpierrez induced Palmacci's\r\n\ninvestment with the promise to invest his own personal funds,\r\n\nUmpierrez's intention was fraudulent, based on a reckless\r\n\nindifference to the truth (which rose to the level of\r\n\nfraudulent intent) because Umpierrez knew or should have known\r\n\nthat he did not have enough equity in the house to raise the\r\n\nmoney through a second mortgage, at least without encumbering\r\n\nthe project property with a mortgage as well. \r\n\n                            -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\n          We must parse this issue with some care. The factual\r\n\nquestion to be determined by the trier of fact is not whether\r\n\nUmpierrez knew or should have known that he did not have the\r\n\nmoney available to invest, but whether in good faith he\r\n\nintended to keep his promise. This is because \"[a] finding\r\n\nthat a debt is non-dischargeable under 523(a)(2)(A) requires a\r\n\nshowing of actual or positive fraud, not merely fraud implied\r\n\nby law\r                 .\"  In re Anastas\r                                  , 94 F.3d at 1286 &amp; n.3 (emphasis added)\r\n\n(quoting 124 Cong.

Among the\r\n\ncircumstances from which scienter may be inferred are: the\r\n\ndefendant's insolvency or some other reason to know that he\r\n\ncannot pay, his repudiation of the promise soon after made, or\r\n\nhis failure even to attempt any performance. Keeton, et al.,\r\n\nsupra, at 764-65. \r\n\n          Where, as here, reckless disregard is being urged\r\n\nupon us as the basis for an inference of scienter, it is\r\n\nimportant to distinguish what the debtor is being accused of\r\n\nrecklessly disregarding. Scienter may be found to exist where\r\n\na debtor recklessly disregards the truth of the representation,\r\n\ne.g., in Umpierrez's case, whether he was recklessly\r\n\nindifferent to whether he would actually keep his promise to\r\n\ninvest personal funds in the Chase project.  See Restatement\r\n\n(Second) of Torts S 526 cmt. e. There must, nonetheless, be an\r\n\nactual finding of intent to deceive: mere inability to pay\r\n\ndoes not constitute such a finding. \r                                               See \r                                                   In re Anastas\r                                                                , 94 F.3d\r\n\nat 1286 (\"[T]he hopeless state of a debtor's financial\r\n\ncondition should never become a substitute for an actual\r\n\nfinding of bad faith.\"). This distinction is apparent from the\r\n\nstructure of the statute itself: 11 U.S.C. S 523(a)(2)(A)\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                         15\r\r\n\nspecifically excludes misrepresentations regarding a debtor's\r\n\nfinancial condition, whereas 11 U.S.C. S 523(a)(2)(B) provides\r\n\nseparately for such misrepresentations. Thus, to the extent\r\n\nPalmacci is claiming that Umpierrez implicitly misrepresented\r\n\nhis financial condition, that is not grounds for an exception\r\n\nto discharge under S 523(a)(2)(A).\r\n\n          In the instant case, if Umpierrez knew or clearly\r\n\nshould have known that there was no realistic way for him to\r\n\nuse his own money to invest, then that is probative of his lack\r\n\nof intent to keep his promise at the time he made the promise.\r\n\nBut the focus must be on whether the representation was made in\r\n\nbad faith, i.e., whether he induced Palmacci's investment with\r\n\nthe intention of reneging on his promise to invest personal\r\n\nfunds (or while recklessly disregarding whether or not he would\r\n\nkeep his promise).  See In \r                                       re \r                                          Anastas, 94 F.3d at 1286 (debt\r\n\nincurred with the intention of avoiding the debt by petitioning\r\n\nfor bankruptcy). \r\n\n          Palmacci contends that the court erred by relying\r\n\nexclusively on Umpierrez's self-serving testimony about his\r\n\nsubjective intent, and failing to consider the surrounding\r\n\ncircumstances in order to infer that Umpierrez's intent was not\r\n\nas he claimed it to be. We do not think Palmacci is correct in\r\n\ncharacterizing the trial court's reasoning as relying solely on\r\n\nUmpierrez's self-serving testimony while ignoring the\r\n\ncircumstantial evidence Palmacci contends shows that testimony\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                         16\r\r\n\nto be incredible. It is true that Umpierrez had just purchased\r\n\nthe residence a few months earlier, for $105,000 and that he\r\n\nhad an $80,000 mortgage on the residence at the time of\r\n\npurchase. Based on this undisputed fact, Palmacci claims that\r\n\nUmpierrez should have known that he only had $25,000 worth of\r\n\nequity in the home, against which he could borrow on a second\r\n\nmortgage without a likely encumbrance of the project property,\r\n\nand therefore that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in\r\n\nbelieving Umpierrez's testimony that, at the time he made his\r\n\npromise, he fully intended to keep it. Umpierrez's claim that\r\n\nan innocent lack of knowledge of these facts (and not a\r\n\nfraudulent intent) caused him to err when he promised to\r\n\ncontribute the $75,000 arguably falls into the category of\r\n\n\"reckless disregard for the truth\" such as to rise to the level\r\n\nof establishing scienter.\r\n\n          These were not, however, the only facts before the\r\n\ntrial court. There was also testimony that Umpierrez had\r\n\ndiscussed getting a personal loan with a banker, and that the\r\n\nbanker had told him he thought the loan would be possible.\r\n\nMoreover, Umpierrez testified that he had had the house\r\n\nappraised in October (shortly before the representation that\r\n\ninduced Palmacci to invest his money) and the house was valued\r\n\nat $185,000, more than enough to secure a loan for the full\r\n\n4.  In addition, the Umpierrezes' share would include the\r\n$5,000 down payment they invested at the time of the purchase\r\nat auction. \r\n\n                            -17-\r                                         17\r\r\n\namount of Umpierrez's promised contribution. Thus, even though\r\n\nUmpierrez did not have a commitment letter from the bank -- a\r\n\nfact that Palmacci emphasizes -- he could well have honestly\r\n\nbelieved that he could work something out with the bank whereby\r\n\nthe bank could protect its security needs without encumbering\r\n\nthe project property and therefore without rendering his\r\n\nrepresentation to Palmacci fraudulent. The court's decision\r\n\nmentioned this possible interpretation, noting that the market\r\n\nvalue of the house in early November (when Palmacci was induced\r\n\nto make his investment in the Chase project) was not\r\n\nnecessarily limited to the price that Umpierrez paid when he\r\n\nbought it in July.\r\n\n          Absent a showing to the contrary, and bearing in mind\r\n\nthat the burden of proof was on Palmacci, we must assume that\r\n\nthe trial court considered all the testimony (and other\r\n\nevidence before it) in its entirety, as well as all reasonable\r\n\ninferences therefrom, before making its determination that\r\n\nUmpierrez did not intend to defraud Palmacci at the time he\r\n\npromised to contribute $75,000 of his personal funds to the\r\n\nproject. We perforce reject Palmacci's claim that the court\r\n\nrelied exclusively on Umpierrez's testimony and failed to\r\n\nconsider the surrounding circumstances.\r\n\n          Moreover, while Palmacci is correct that intent to\r\n\ndeceive may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances,\r\n\nincluding inferences from circumstantial facts, \r                                                           see \r                                                               Desmond v.\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                         18\r\r\n\nVarrasso \r                     (In \r                         re \r                            Varrasso), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195673\"><a href=\"/opinion/195673/varrasso-v-desmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764 (1st Cir. 1994),\r\n\nscienter cannot be presumed, \r                                        id. at 764-65; \r                                                      In re Cohn\r                                                                , 54 F.3d\r\n\nat 1120. \"The mere breach of a promise is not enough in itself\r\n\nto establish the fraudulent intent.\" Keeton, et al.,   supra,\r\n\nS 108, at 764.\r\n\n          Thus, although the evidence here might \"support the\r\n\nbankruptcy court's decision had it inferred an intent to\r\n\ndeceive from the circumstantial evidence admitted in this case,\r\n\n[it does] not compel such a finding and [does] not require us\r\n\nto reverse the court's holding.\" National Union Fire Ins.

City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. at 573-74.\r\n\n          In the instant case, Umpierrez testified that he\r\n\nthought he would be able to come up with his $75,000 investment\r\n\nfrom his personal funds, and the judge believed him, apparently\r\n\ntaking into account all circumstances including the weight of\r\n\nthe alleged unreasonableness of his belief. The bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt found, as a matter of fact, that Umpierrez did not intend\r\n\nto defraud Palmacci when he promised to contribute $75,000 of\r\n\nhis own personal funds to the project. In the context of the\r\n\nrecord in this case, we read this as a determination that there\r\n\nwas no scienter, i.e., that there was no knowing\r\n\nmisrepresentation and no reckless disregard for the truth such\r\n\nas would rise to the level of fraudulent intent. After\r\n\ncarefully reviewing the record in its entirety, we conclude\r\n\nthat there is sufficient evidence for the trial court to have\r\n\nconcluded that Umpierrez's intent was not fraudulent. We\r\n\ncannot say the trial court clearly erred in its choice of which\r\n\ninferences to draw from the evidence presented to it.\r\n\n                            -20-\r                                         20\r\r\n\nTherefore we affirm the court's rejection of the first alleged\r\n\nmisrepresentation claim.\r\n\n          Palmacci's second claim is that Umpierrez\r\n\nmisrepresented to him that the project would have a total\r\n\ncapital contribution of $250,000. This claim is derivative\r\n\nfrom the first: to whatever extent Umpierrez fell short on his\r\n\ncontribution of $75,000, there would result a like shortfall in\r\n\nthe total project capitalization. Palmacci does not make any\r\n\nargument as to his second claim that differs from his arguments\r\n\non the first claim. Therefore, our rejection of the second\r\n\nflows ineluctably from our conclusion as to the first. \r\n\n          Palmacci's third claim is that Umpierrez\r\n\nmisrepresented the role of the trust that was created in\r\n\nconnection with the Chase project. According to Palmacci's\r\n\nbrief, Umpierrez represented that \"the project was to be held\r\n\nin trust supervised by a New Hampshire attorney.\" Palmacci\r\n\nconcedes that a trust was indeed set up after he made his\r\n\ninvestment, but he argues that \"[t]he reality of the situation\r\n\nwas that the trust had no role to play in the supervision of\r\n\nthe project.\" Palmacci does not make it clear exactly what was\r\n\nallegedly represented to him regarding the trust's supervision\r\n\n5.  Palmacci also argues that the bankruptcy court erred in\r\nholding that he was not justified in relying on Umpierrez's\r\nrepresentations. We need not decide this issue because, having\r\nfailed to meet his burden on the intent element, it does not\r\navail him that he may have met the remaining elements; he must\r\nsatisfy all requirements in order to establish his claim.\r\n\n                            -21-\r                                         21\r\r\n\nof the Chase project. In his brief he seems to imply that\r\n\nUmpierrez actually told him the trust would supervise the\r\n\ninvestment project itself (as opposed to being simply a vehicle\r\n\nfor controlling the flow of funds). Scrutiny of Palmacci's\r\n\nfactual assertions, however, in his testimony and in the\r\n\nfactual portion of his brief, reveal a claim merely that\r\n\nPalmacci's \"idea of the role of the trust\" was that the trustee\r\n\nwould be responsible for and control how funds were used by the\r\n\nbuilders. Because of this \"idea,\" Palmacci \"felt assured\" that\r\n\nthe project \"would be supervised correctly, and there was less\r\n\nchance of things going bad.\" Palmacci did not testify as to\r\n\nthe basis for his subjective understanding. For all we know,\r\n\nthe basis could have been merely that Palmacci himself thought\r\n\na trust always does so supervise, without any representation by\r\n\nUmpierrez beyond the mere creation of a trust.\r\n\n          The bankruptcy court dismissed the trust issue on the\r\n\nground that Palmacci could not have \"justifiably relied\" on the\r\n\nrole of the trust as supervising the real estate project. The\r\n\ncourt reasoned that the trust was not established until\r\n\nNovember 11, 1991, several days after November 7, when Palmacci\r\n\nmade his investment, so Palmacci could not have known the terms\r\n\nof the trust instrument and therefore could not have been\r\n\njustified in relying on any such terms. (The district court\r\n\ndecision did not specifically address the alleged\r\n\nmisrepresentation regarding the role of the trust.) \r\n\n                            -22-\r                                         22\r\r\n\n          Palmacci is correct that the bankruptcy court's\r\n\nanalysis is flawed. Even if the trust was not actually created\r\n\nuntil after he invested his money, Palmacci could conceivably\r\n\nhave relied on verbal (or written) representations from\r\n\nUmpierrez -- made on or before November 7 -- as to how the\r\n\ntrust would be structured or what its role would be once the\r\n\ntrust was created. And it might well have been justifiable for\r\n\nPalmacci to rely on such representations regardless of whether\r\n\nthe trust instrument had yet been drafted. If such\r\n\nrepresentations were false and made with scienter, then this\r\n\nthird claim could not be dismissed based on the trial court's\r\n\nreasoning.\r\n\n          Nevertheless, we will affirm a correct result reached\r\n\nby the court below \"on any independently sufficient ground made\r\n\nmanifest by the record.\"  AIDS Action Comm. of Mass. v. MBTA,\r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684073\"><a href=\"/opinion/684073/aids-action-committee-of-massachusetts-inc-v-massachusetts-bay/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks\r\n\nomitted). Although the bankruptcy court's stated reason for\r\n\nrejecting Palmacci's argument concerning the establishment of\r\n\na trust was based on flawed reasoning, its conclusion was\r\n\ncorrect. Our review of the record, including Palmacci's own\r\n\ntestimony, reveals absolutely no evidence clearly indicating\r\n\nthat Umpierrez's statements or actions were the basis for\r\n\nPalmacci's subjective \"idea\" or feeling that the trust would\r\n\nsupervise the project. Indeed, as the bankruptcy court pointed\r\n\nout, the attorney who drew up the trust testified that the\r\n\n                            -23-\r                                         23\r\r\n\nconcept of a trust was not even discussed by the investors\r\n\nbefore Palmacci invested his money in the project. Thus, the\r\n\nonly representation that is supportable on this record is that\r\n\na trust would be created and that the trustee would be an\r\n\nattorney. This much was indisputably carried out. It is not\r\n\nenough for Palmacci to testify that his \"idea of the role of\r\n\nthe trust\" was to supervise the operation of the project,\r\n\nwithout specifying the source of this idea. Because the record\r\n\nis devoid of evidence that would support a finding that a\r\n\nmisrepresentation was made on the trust issue, we need not\r\n\nconsider the dispute as to whether Palmacci was justified in\r\n\nrelying on any alleged representation about the role of the\r\n\ntrust.\r\n\n          Finally, Palmacci alleges that the bankruptcy court\r\n\nerred as a matter of law when it restricted the testimony of\r\n\nPalmacci's expert witness to events that took place only prior\r\n\nto or soon after the transaction at issue. A trial court has\r\n\nwide discretion in determining the admissibility of expert\r\n\ntestimony, especially where the issue is being tried directly\r\n\nto the bench.

Nor does failure to carry out one's\r\n\nintentions constitute a basis for finding a debt\r\n\nnondischargeable under S 523(a)(2)(A) absent a showing that the\r\n\nclaimed fraud existed at the inception of the debt. \r\n\n          Palmacci argues, however, that a promissor's\r\n\nsubsequent conduct may reflect his state of mind at the time he\r\n\n                            -25-\r                                         25\r\r\n\nmade the promise, and thus may be considered in determining\r\n\nwhether he possessed the requisite fraudulent intent \r                                                               ab initio\r                                                                        .\r\n\nIt is true that subsequent conduct may be relevant to an\r\n\nearlier state of mind. In  Williamson \r                                                  v. \r                                                     Busconi, 87 F.3d at\r\n\n603, we concluded that the bankruptcy court abused its\r\n\ndiscretion by excluding evidence as to conduct \r                                                          subsequent to a\r\n\nreal estate closing, from which a factfinder reasonably could\r\n\nhave inferred that Busconi had not intended to pay the note \r                                                                       at\r\n\nthe time\r                    it was executed. The lower court in \r                                                        Busconi said this\r\n\nevidence was irrelevant, and then expressly credited Busconi's\r\n\ntestimony (although Williamson testified too). Finding that\r\n\nWilliamson had failed to establish the requisite fraudulent\r\n\nintent, the bankruptcy court ruled the debt dischargeable. \r                                                                      Id.\r\n\n          We rejected that reasoning, noting that: \r\n\n          As direct evidence is seldom available,\r\n          fraudulent intent normally is determined\r\n          from the totality of the circumstances.\r\n          And since \"subsequent conduct may reflect\r\n          back to the promissor's state of mind and\r\n          thus may be considered in ascertaining\r\n          whether there was fraudulent intent\" at\r\n          the time the promise was made, proper\r\n          application of the \"totality\" test in this\r\n          context often warrants consideration of\r\n          post-transaction conduct and\r\n          contemporaneous events.\r\n\nId. at 603 (citation omitted) (quoting \r                                                 Krenowsky v.

The facts of this case are nothing like the facts\r\n\nin the cases relied upon by Palmacci,   where an overarching\r\n\nscheme to defraud the creditor was shown. In  In \r                                                             re \r                                                                 Haining,\r\n\n119 B.R. at 464, the debtor engaged in a pattern of\r\n\ntransferring all her assets to a third party to the detriment\r\n\nof her creditors. The court reasonably concluded that the\r\n\ndebtor's fraudulent scheme began prior to the debt in dispute,\r\n\nand continued throughout the period. Similarly, in   Comerica\r\n\nBank v. Weinhardt (In re Weinhardt)\r                                              , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1522793\"><a href=\"/opinion/1522793/in-re-weinhardt/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 680 (Bankr.\r\n\nM.D. Fla. 1993), the business into which the debtor was to have\r\n\ninvested the creditor's funds never existed, and the debtor\r\n\nspent all the money on a gambling spree. The court concluded\r\n\nthat evidence of the subsequent pattern of conduct helped to\r\n\nshow that the debtor did not, even at the outset, intend to use\r\n\nthe funds obtained for the purposes stated. \r\n\n          In the instant case, the disputed testimony simply\r\n\ndoes not rise to the same level of probative value on the issue\r\n\nof Umpierrez's intent to defraud in the inducement. The\r\n\nproffered testimony related to events almost two years after\r\n\nPalmacci's investment was induced. Moreover, the allegations\r\n\n6.  The timing and other aspects of relevance were not\r\ndelineated in our opinion in Busconi. There we simply stated\r\nthat the proffered evidence of subsequent conduct was evidence\r\n\"from which a factfinder reasonably could have inferred that\r\nBusconi had not intended to pay the note at the time it was\r\nexecuted.\" 87 F.3d at 603. A similar conclusion cannot be\r\ndrawn in the instant case.\r\n\n                            -27-\r                                         27\r\r\n\nPalmacci sought to prove through his proffered expert -- that\r\n\nthe losses on the investment were not proportionately shared\r\n\nand that the project's 1992 and 1993 financial statements\r\n\nindicated that Umpierrez did not spend all project money\r\n\nexactly as originally stated in the business proposal (although\r\n\nthey did not indicate that he failed to apply the funds to the\r\n\nChase project in some way) -- would not have been directly\r\n\nprobative of Umpierrez's intent to deceive in 1991. Certainly\r\n\nthe bankruptcy court, which heard all the evidence, did not\r\n\nabuse its discretion in refusing to hear the proffered expert\r\n\ntestimony.\r\n\n          Even if we were to conclude on the present facts that\r\n\nthe bankruptcy court erred in excluding the expert testimony,\r\n\nwe need not reverse on this issue because excluding this\r\n\nevidence did not affect Palmacci's substantial rights.    See\r\n\nBusconi, 87 F.2d at 603. In order to win a reversal, an\r\n\nappellant who claims error in the admissibility of evidence\r\n\nmust also show that the evidentiary ruling adversely affected\r\n\nhis \"substantial rights.\"  See Fed.

Palmacci had hoped to \"turn[] a\r\n\npretty fast profit on it,\" as he had seen Gus Umpierrez do on\r\n\nprior real estate deals. At the same time, Palmacci understood\r\n\nthat he was taking a risk; he might not only not make a \"fast\r\n\nprofit\" but he might lose money on the deal. Now that the\r\n\nproject has gone sour, Palmacci cannot prevent Umpierrez from\r\n\ndischarging his debts in bankruptcy unless he demonstrates all\r\n\nthe elements of fraud or false representation. He has failed\r\n\nto meet this burden with respect to at least one element of\r\n\neach of the three misrepresentations that he has alleged.\r\n\nAccordingly, the judgment is \r                                        affirmed.
