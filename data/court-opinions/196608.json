In this appeal by the City of Lynn\r                    CYR, Circuit Judge.\r                                      \r\n\n(\"City\"), we consider whether an established City policy, permit-\r\n\nting  forcible,  warrantless  entries  of private  residences  to\r\n\nenforce involuntary civil commitment orders, violates  the Fourth\r\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.   The district court\r\n\ngranted summary judgment  for plaintiff Mary  McCabe, administra-\r\n\ntrix of the  estate of  Ruchla Zinger, a  Holocaust survivor  who\r\n\ndied in her Lynn home  during a tragic attempt by City  police to\r\n\nexecute  an involuntary  commitment order  which had  been issued\r\n\nagainst  her.   For  the reasons  discussed  in this  opinion, we\r\n\nconclude that the challenged City policy came within an exception\r\n\nto the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement. \r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          Ms. Zinger, a 64-year-old Lynn, Massachusetts, resident\r\n\nwith a history of mental illness and psychiatric hospitalization,\r\n\nas well as severe  obesity and high blood pressure,  resisted all\r\n\nattempts  at communication  and intervention  by family  members.\r\n\nShe  refused to  be examined  by a  doctor after  threatening her\r\n\nformer husband  with physical  harm and upsetting  her downstairs\r\n\nneighbors  by causing loud and violent disturbances in her apart-\r\n\nment, thereby prompting her  family to initiate eviction proceed-\r\n\nings against her.1   Subsequently,  on September 6,  1989, a  li-\r\n\ncensed  psychiatrist,  Dr.  Jakov Barden,  signed  an application\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Ms. Zinger's former husband and their children owned the \r\nbuilding in which Ms. Zinger's apartment was located.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n[hereinafter:  \"pink paper\"] for a ten-day involuntary commitment\r\n\nof Ms.  Zinger pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 123,   12(a),\r\n\nbased exclusively on the reports of family members  and neighbors\r\n\nas to Ms. Zinger's physical and behavioral symptoms.  \r\n\n          The next  morning, Constable Kenneth  Jackson, who  had\r\n\nbeen unsuccessful in previous  attempts to serve Ms. Zinger  with\r\n\nan  eviction notice, and was  scheduled to execute  a judgment of\r\n\neviction  against her at  1:00 p.m. that  afternoon, learned that\r\n\nthe  pink  paper had  been issued  against  Ms. Zinger  the night\r\n\nbefore, and contacted the Lynn police department.  The  constable\r\n\ninformed  the  Lynn police,  based  on  his experience  with  Ms.\r\n\nZinger, that he believed she would resist committal.  The consta-\r\n\nble  and the Lynn police officers arranged  to meet at the Zinger\r\n\napartment  building at 1:00 p.m.,  to execute the  pink paper and\r\n\nthe eviction order.  \r\n\n          Three Lynn police officers and the constable arrived at\r\n\nthe Zinger apartment building  at the appointed hour, accompanied\r\n\nby  a crew from the  Life-Line Ambulance Service,  which had been\r\n\nengaged to  restrain Ms.  Zinger as necessary,  physically remove\r\n\nher from the apartment, and transport her to the hospital.  After\r\n\nreceiving no response to their knocks, the officers kicked in the\r\n\noutside apartment-house door and proceeded upstairs to the Zinger\r\n\napartment.   The officers  knocked and announced  their presence,\r\n\nreceived no response, and  began to kick in the  Zinger apartment\r\n\ndoor.   Ms. Zinger  began screaming  \"Why are  you kicking  in my\r\n\ndoor?\" then cracked  it open.  Identifying themselves  as police,\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nthe  officers told her  that they were  going to bring  her under\r\n\nmedical care, to which  she responded:  \"No  doctors!\"  When  she\r\n\nbegan  to close the door,  the officers shoved  their way inside.\r\n\nLater, while  the officers  were forcibly  removing her from  the\r\n\napartment, Ms.  Zinger suffered a  cardio-respiratory arrest  and\r\n\ndied.2 \r\n\n          After  McCabe, as administratrix, instituted this civil\r\n\nrights  action under 42 U.S.C.    1983 against  the City, amongst\r\n\nothers,3  in  September 1992,  an  amended  complaint alleged  an\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The only  constitutional violation McCabe attributes to the\r\nCity  is the forcible warrantless entry.  In her cross-motion for\r\nsummary  judgment, McCabe  did  not press  her \"excessive  force\"\r\nclaim  that a City policy authorized or caused the police actions\r\nutilized  to restrain  Ms. Zinger.   See  infra note  4.   We now\r                                                         \r\nsummarize  the  allegations against  the  individual officers  in\r\norder to provide additional context.  \r\n     After the officers pushed their  way into her apartment  and\r\nMs.  Zinger began screaming, the officers forced her to the floor\r\non her  stomach and handcuffed  her hands behind  her back.   She\r\nlost control of her bladder.  The ambulance crew refused to carry\r\nher  down the  stairs, asserting  that she  was too  heavy.   The\r\nofficers then placed her in a sitting position.  With one officer\r\ngripping  her ankles and another holding her under her handcuffed\r\narms, she was  carried to the stairs, then  dragged down one step\r\nat a time while still  in a sitting position.  At the bottom, the\r\nambulance  crew strapped her onto  the stretcher, face  down.  By\r\nthis time she had stopped screaming and the officers noticed that\r\nher hands appeared blue and she was bleeding from her mouth.  Ms.\r\nZinger was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.\r\n\n     3The judgment appealed from is nonetheless \"final\" as to all\r\nparties and claims.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); 28 U.S.C.   1291.\r                                  \r\nThe original  ten-count complaint named as  defendants, the City,\r\nthe dispatching police supervisor and the three individual police\r\nofficers who  executed  the pink  paper  (in their  official  and\r\nindividual capacities), the constable, the ambulance company, the\r\nambulance crew,  Dr. Barden, and  the Tri-City Mental  Health and\r\nRetardation Center where Dr.  Barden worked.  In addition  to her\r\nclaims  under     1983,  McCabe alleged  common-law  assault  and\r\nbattery, and negligence.  In June 1993, McCabe settled all claims\r\nagainst the doctor and  the hospital.  In February  1995, after a\r\njury returned verdicts against  the City and Life-Line Ambulance,\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nestablished  City policy  permitting police  officers to  execute\r\n\npink  papers  by  means  of forcible,  warrantless  entries  into\r\n\nprivate residences absent demonstrable exigent circumstances, and\r\n\nthat this  City policy proximately caused  an actionable depriva-\r\n\ntion  of  Ms. Zinger's  Fourth Amendment  right  to be  free from\r\n\nunreasonable  searches.4    After  hearing,  the  district  court\r\n\ngranted the McCabe cross-motion  for summary judgment against the\r\n\nCity on the issue of liability.   McCabe v. City of Lynn,  875 F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp. 53,  63 (D. Mass.  1995).  In  the ensuing trial,  the jury\r\n\nawarded $850,000 in damages against the City and $500,000 against\r\n\nLife-Line Ambulance.  The City thereupon brought this appeal from\r\n\nthe final judgment entered against it.  \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nA.   District Court Opinion\r          A.   District Court Opinion\r                                     \r\n\n          The district court found  that the City policy violated\r\n\nthe  Fourth Amendment, for the following reasons.  The City's own\r\n\npolicy expert attested that the City did not require its officers\r\n\nto obtain a search  warrant before effecting a warrantless  entry\r\n\nof a residence to execute a pink paper, leaving it instead to the\r\n\ndiscretion  of the officers  whether and when  such a warrantless\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nthe claims against the four  police officers, the constable,  and\r\nthe ambulance crew were dismissed, without prejudice, by stipula-\r\ntion. \r\n\n     4By  contrast,  the initial  complaint  had  alleged a  City\r\npolicy  permitting the use of  excessive force, and  a failure to\r\ntrain or supervise officers, in executing involuntary  commitment\r\nseizures.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nentry  was necessary.  Id. at 58.   The district court noted that\r                                   \r\n\nwarrantless,  nonconsensual entries  into private  residences are\r\n\npresumptively \"unreasonable\"  under the Fourth  Amendment, absent\r\n\nexigent circumstances.   Id. at 58-59.  Although imminent threats\r                                      \r\n\nto the lives and safety of the police officers, or members of the\r\n\npublic, often  give rise  to exigent circumstances  justifying an\r\n\nimmediate  warrantless  entry, the  court  found  that \"the  Lynn\r\n\npolice  acted with  leisure in  arranging  a convenient  time\" to\r                                     \r\n\nserve the pink paper upon Ms. Zinger, thereby belying any conten-\r\n\ntion that \"'some real[,] immediate or serious consequences [would\r\n\noccur] if  [the officers]  postponed action  to get  a warrant.'\"\r\n\nId. at 59, 62 (citation omitted).  \r             \r\n\n          The  district  court nonetheless  recognized  that even\r\n\nabsent exigent  circumstances the warrant requirement  may not be\r\n\napplicable  in certain  regulatory  contexts wherein  warrantless\r\n\nsearch  procedures serve  as invaluable  \"administrative tool[s]\"\r\n\nand are \"far less invasive\" than searches directed at discovering\r\n\nevidence  of crime.   Id.  at 59-60.    The court  identified two\r                                   \r\n\nfactors which  weighed against a ruling that  the challenged City\r\n\npolicy  came within  this  special regulatory  category.   First,\r\n\nunlike  a  judicial  officer,  the  licensed  medical-psychiatric\r\n\nphysicians authorized to  issue pink papers under Mass. Gen. Laws\r\n\nAnn.  ch. 123,   12(a),  are \"not qualified  to determine whether\r\n\nprobable cause exists.\"   Id. at 61.  Second,  \"the agents of the\r                                       \r\n\ndoctors  in this case are  police officers with  guns and batons,\r\n\nnot  hospital  orderlies and  nurses,\"  so  that  \"[t]here is  no\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ntherapeutic  relationship which  a warrant  mechanism would  dis-\r\n\nrupt.\"  Id.\r                     \r\n\nB.

Gen.\r\n\nLaws Ann. ch. 123,   12(a)) violates the Fourth Amendment because\r\n\nit routinely  allows warrantless  entries of a  residence, absent\r\n\n\"exigent circumstances,\" to  effect involuntary commitments;  nor\r\n\nhave we found such  a case.  The cases cited by the City consider\r\n\nwhether  a seizure of the person effected pursuant to an involun-\r                                          \r\n\ntary commitment statute violates  the due process requirements of\r                                                           \r\n\nthe  Fifth and Fourteenth  Amendments,6 or whether  the manner in\r\n\nwhich the government detains a  person violates the Fourth Amend-\r\n\nment  prohibition against  unreasonable seizures.7   Nonetheless,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6See, e.g., Project Release v.

Of course,  the City\r\n\nargues that every  entry is per se  \"exigent\" since a pink  paper\r                                            \r\n\ncan  only issue upon an  expert medical finding  that the subject\r\n\npresently  poses a  \"likelihood of  serious harm\"  to  herself or\r\n\nothers, which in turn provides  the police with reasonable  cause\r\n\nto believe that an  immediate, forcible entry for the  purpose of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nof  involuntary commitment,  or  seizure of  the person,  without\r\nindependent  judicial  determination  of  probable  cause,  where\r\ncommitment occurred while person was in jail).\r                                                      \r\n     Moreover,  the  absence  of  any authority  for  the  McCabe\r\ncontention    that the warrantless  \"forcible entry\" phase of  an\r\ninvoluntary  commitment should  be  treated differently  than the\r\ncommittal \"seizure\" itself    arguably indicates that a constitu-\r\ntional  foundation is  lacking.   See  Cardona,  903 F.2d  at  64\r                                                        \r\n(rejecting similar attempt to draw  \"entirely artificial distinc-\r\ntion[s]  between `search'  jurisprudence and  `seizure' jurispru-\r\ndence\").   And since the  cases cited by  the City overwhelmingly\r\nhold  that warrantless, involuntary commitment seizures generally\r\ncomport with  the strictures  of the  Fourth Amendment,  see Vil-\r                                                                           \r\nlanova, 972 F.2d at  795 (\"There is  no requirement of a  warrant\r                \r\nissued by  a judicial officer [to  seize the person  subject to a\r\ncommitment order].\"),  thus constituting  a valid pink  paper the\r\npractical  equivalent of an arrest warrant, see supra note 5; cf.\r                                                                           \r\nWelsh, 466 U.S. at 748-49;  Payton, 445 U.S. at 586; Hegarty,  53\r                                                                      \r\nF.3d at 1373,  a separate  requirement that a  search warrant  be\r\nobtained before entering the residence to seize the subject could\r\nbe viewed as supererogatory.\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\ndetaining the resistant subject is necessary to avert the  \"seri-\r\n\nous harm\" identified in the pink paper.  \r\n\n          On the  other hand,  McCabe contends that  these remote\r\n\nmedical-psychiatric \"emergency\" determinations do not equate with\r\n\nconstitutionally cognizable \"exigent circumstances,\" because they\r\n\ndo  not turn  on the  executing officer's  fact-specific, on-the-\r\n\nscene assessment as to  the immediacy of any putative  threat the\r\n\nsubject  may pose  to herself  or others.   McCabe  stresses that\r\n\nduring  the several hours which were allowed to elapse before the\r\n\npink  paper was executed upon Ms. Zinger, the officers would have\r\n\nhad ample time to obtain a search warrant.  And McCabe points out\r\n\nthat  none of  the four  recognized \"exigent  circumstances,\" see\r                                                                           \r\n\nsupra p. 10,  was plainly present immediately before the forcible\r               \r\n\npolice entry.            As these claims reflect the  legal gloss\r\n\nplaced on  the record  evidence, rather  than  a genuine  factual\r\n\ndispute  concerning the substance of the City policy, we need not\r\n\nenter the skirmish  over the  distinctions between  \"emergencies\"\r\n\nand \"exigent  circumstances.\"  The  City policy, as  evidenced by\r\n\nthe  actual  conduct  of  its police  officers,8  falls  squarely\r\n\nwithin  a recognized  class of  systemic \"special  need\" searches\r                                                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8Contrary to McCabe's contention, we need not decide whether\r\nthe City  waived the argument  that its police  officers' actions\r\nwere  not  undertaken pursuant  to City  policy,  and that  it is\r\ntherefore  not liable  under Monell, 436  U.S. at 694.   The City\r                                             \r\nmerely  argues that  the  actual police  conduct  in effecting  a\r\nwarrantless entry often provides the best circumstantial evidence\r\nas  to the nature  of the challenged municipal  policy.  See Bor-\r                                                                           \r\ndanaro, 871 F.2d at  1156-57 (observing that the event  itself is\r                \r\nevidence that police officers  acted in accordance with municipal\r\npolicy). \r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nwhich are conducted without  warrants in furtherance of important\r\n\nadministrative  purposes.    Again, the  fundamental  concern  of\r\n\nFourth Amendment jurisprudence in  general, and in \"special need\"\r\n\nsearch cases as  well, is whether an established search procedure\r\n\nis \"reasonable\"  in  light of  the  actual circumstances  in  the\r\n\nparticular  case.  See Cady, 413  U.S. at 439-40; see also O'Con-\r                                                                           \r\n\nnor, 480 U.S. at 719; T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 337.  \"Reasonableness,\"\r                                      \r\n\nin turn, depends on  \"'balanc[ing] the nature and quality  of the\r\n\nintrusion on the individual's  Fourth Amendment interests against\r\n\nthe importance  of the governmental interests  alleged to justify\r\n\nthe intrusion.'\"   O'Connor, 480 U.S. at  719 (citation omitted);\r                                     \r\n\nsee T.L.O.,  469 U.S. at 341;  Cardona, 903 F.2d at  67; cf.

Thus, we  think it is  especially significant to\r\n\nthe  present  analysis that  warrantless \"special  need\" searches\r\n\nhave been condoned by the courts in circumstances where the State\r\n\ninterests  were  far  less  compelling and  urgent.    Cf., e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nO'Connor, 480 U.S. at 724 (noting:  because \"public employees are\r                  \r\n\nentrusted with tremendous  responsibility,\" \"the consequences  of\r\n\ntheir misconduct  or  incompetence to  both  the agency  and  the\r\n\npublic interest can  be severe\");  New York v.

Laws Ann.  ch. 123,   12(a), in general,  and the commitment\r\n\norder  issued by  Dr. Barden,  in particular,  were appropriately\r\n\nsuited to these legitimate purposes.  \r\n\n          The application for  temporary hospitalization,  signed\r\n\nby Dr. Barden, expressly referenced Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 123,\r\n\n  12(a), which authorizes  four categories of involuntary commit-\r\n\nment procedures:    \r\n\n          (1)  a qualified  physician, psychologist, or\r\n               psychiatric  nurse  who  has  personally\r\n               examined a person, and who has reason to\r\n               believe that  the person would  create a\r\n               \"likelihood of serious harm,\" may sign a\r\n               \"pink paper\" authorizing law enforcement\r\n               officials  to  restrain  that person  to\r\n               permit hospitalization for up to  a ten-\r\n               day period;\r\n\n          (2)  in an \"emergency situation,\" a qualified\r\n               physician, psychologist, or  psychiatric\r\n               nurse  may sign a  pink paper, even when\r\n               the alleged mentally ill  person refuses\r\n               to submit to  a medical examination,  if\r\n               the  \"facts  and circumstances\"  suggest\r\n               that the person would create  a \"likeli-\r\n               hood of serious harm\";\r\n\n          (3)  in  an  \"emergency situation,\"  a police\r\n               officer  may  restrain a  person  he be-\r\n               lieves creates a \"likelihood  of serious\r\n               harm,\" if no  qualified physician,  psy-\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9Thus, a  \"mental illness\"  determination alone is  insuffi-\r\ncient to support an involuntary commitment  order; the State must\r\nalso show that the person subjected to involuntary  commitment is\r\n\"dangerous.\"   See O'Connor  v.

As only the  category 4  commitment\r\n\nprocedure expressly incorporates a warrant requirement,  we think\r\n\nit  clear  that  the  statute  implicitly  authorizes warrantless\r\n\nsearches and seizures in the three remaining contexts.  Since Ms.\r\n\nZinger  repeatedly  rejected  family  pleas that  she  submit  to\r\n\nexamination by  a physician,  and because  Dr.  Barden based  his\r\n\nexpert  medical-psychiatric opinion  exclusively on  reports from\r\n\nfamily  members and  neighbors, we  conclude  also that  the pink\r\n\npaper in this case did issue under category 2.  The only question\r\n\nbefore  us,  therefore,  concerns  the  constitutionality  of the\r\n\n\"category 2\" warrantless search procedure. \r\n\n          The pink paper was based on Dr. Barden's expert opinion\r\n\nthat Ms. Zinger  \"require[d] hospitalization so  as to avoid  the\r\n\nlikelihood of serious  harm by  reason of mental  illness.\"   Dr.\r\n\nBarden  described  the  particular  grounds for  concluding  that\r\n\nimmediate hospitalization was required:\r\n\n          [Patient]  has a [history]  of mental illness\r\n          and she was  hospitalized at Danvers  [State]\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\n          Hospital couple  of years ago.   [Patient] is\r\n          very angry and hostile; she is very impulsive\r\n          and explosive.  She  made threats to harm her\r\n          ex-husband.  [Patient]  is dangerous to  oth-\r\n          ers.\r\n\nThe  involuntary  commitment application,  and  the Massachusetts\r\n\nstatute,  define \"likelihood  of serious  harm\"     the governing\r\n\ncriterion for commitment    as: \r\n\n          (1) a  substantial risk  of physical harm  to\r\n          the  person [her]self  as manifested  by evi-\r\n          dence of, threats of, or attempts at, suicide\r\n          or serious  bodily harm;   (2) a  substantial\r\n          risk  of physical  harm to  other persons  as\r\n          manifested by evidence of homicidal  or other\r\n          violent  behavior or evidence that others are\r\n          placed in reasonable fear of violent behavior\r\n          and serious physical harm to  them;  or (3) a\r\n          very substantial risk of  physical impairment\r\n          or injury  to the person  [her]self as  mani-\r\n          fested  by evidence that  such person's judg-\r\n          ment is  so affected that [s]he  is unable to\r\n          protect [her]self  in the community  and that\r\n          reasonable provision for h[er]  protection is\r\n          not available in the community.\r\n\nMass.

Given the notori-\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nous difficulties  in predicting  individual human  behavior based\r\n\nsolely on  symptomatology, id.  at 1539,  we conclude  that Mass.\r                                        \r\n\nGen. Laws Ann. ch. 123,   1, prescribes  a sufficiently clear and\r\n\nreasonably  reliable  administrative standard  for  ensuring that\r\n\ninvoluntary commitments  are  limited to  imminently  \"dangerous\"\r\n\nmentally ill persons in emergent circumstances. \r\n\n          Finally, the specific focus  and overall context of the\r\n\nMassachusetts  statute  implicitly  circumscribe  the  category 2\r\n\nsearch  procedure within  narrow  bounds.   A  police officer  is\r\n\npermitted to enter a  residence without a warrant for  the exclu-\r\n\nsive purpose  of detaining a recalcitrant  and dangerous mentally\r\n\nill person  pursuant to  a duly issued  pink paper,  but may  not\r\n\nengage  in a generalized search.  As  the officers in the instant\r\n\ncase did not  exceed these  bounds, we conclude  that Mass.  Gen.\r\n\nLaws Ann. ch. 123,    12(a), and consequently the  City policy in\r\n\npursuance  of  the statutory  design, see  supra pps.  12-14, are\r                                                          \r\n\nappropriately  tailored  to serve  the  legitimate  and important\r\n\nState and municipal interest  in ensuring that dangerous mentally\r\n\nill persons not cause physical harm to themselves or others.\r\n\n          (b)  Practicality of Warrant Requirement\r                    (b)  Practicality of Warrant Requirement\r                                                            \r\n\n          The determination  that there  exists a legitimate  and\r\n\nsubstantial  governmental  interest in  conducting  a warrantless\r\n\nsearch  in certain  circumstances  satisfies  only the  threshold\r\n\ninquiry  under the  reasonableness test.   For  an administrative\r\n\nsearch  procedure to survive  constitutional challenge  under the\r\n\n\"special need\" exception, it must also appear that the burdens of\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\ncomplying  with a  warrant requirement are  likely to  defeat the\r\n\nimportant governmental purposes the warrantless  search procedure\r\n\nwas designed to serve.    \r\n\n          In  assessing  whether  the  public  interest\r\n          demands  creation of  a general  exception to\r\n          the  Fourth Amendment's  warrant requirement,\r\n          the question is not whether the public inter-\r\n          est justifies the type of search in question,\r\n          but whether the authority to search should be\r\n          evidenced by a warrant, which in turn depends\r\n          in part upon whether the burden  of obtaining\r\n          a warrant is likely  to frustrate the govern-\r\n          mental purpose behind the search.  \r\n\nCamara, 387 U.S. at 533.\r                \r\n\n          Compliance with a warrant requirement in the context of\r\n\nthese temporary, involuntary commitments  for medical-psychiatric\r\n\nexamination  would entail  critical  delays  in safeguarding  the\r\n\nmentally ill person,  and others, without affording  commensurate\r\n\nprivacy protections  to the subject.  Category  2 searches foster\r\n\nimportant governmental  interests  largely because  the  inherent\r\n\nimprecision in predicting the timing of any outbreak  of \"danger-\r\n\nousness\" on the  part of the  recalcitrant, mentally ill  person,\r\n\nsee  Moore, 825 F. Supp. at 1539,  inevitably means that the time\r                    \r\n\nspent  securing judicial  approval of  a pink paper  represents a\r\n\npotentially dangerous delay of incalculable proportion.    \r                                                     \r\n\n          In this  particular case,  of course, McCabe  points to\r\n\nthe undisputed  evidence that the police  officers waited several\r\n\nhours before executing the  pink paper, thus demonstrating little\r\n\nconcern that Ms. Zinger might exhibit the sort of sudden onset of\r\n\n\"dangerousness\" alluded to in the assessment made by  Dr. Barden.\r\n\nAlthough this argument might hold sway were the constitutionality\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nof  the warrantless  entry dependent on  an ad  hoc, on-the-scene\r                                                             \r\n\n\"exigent circumstances\"  determination made by the  police, it is\r\n\nno rejoinder to the claimed \"reasonableness\" of a  \"special need\"\r\n\nsearch  procedure policy, which must  focus not on the particular\r\n\ncase but  on  the essential  systemic  attributes of  the  search\r\n\nprocedure itself: \r\n\n          The  dissent  argues  that in  this  case the\r\n          police had  ample  time to  secure an  arrest\r\n          warrant,  rendering  invalid  any claim  that\r\n          complying  with traditional  fourth amendment\r\n          requirements was impracticable.   That  view-\r\n          point  distorts Griffin's  \"impracticability\"\r                                           \r\n          prong.  In  Griffin, the Court inquired  into\r                                       \r\n          the  systemic impracticability  of compelling\r                                                  \r\n          those involved in implementation of  a proba-\r\n          tion regime to obtain  warrants.  The imprac-\r\n          ticability  of  obtaining  a warrant  in  the\r\n          particular case did not  enter into the equa-\r                                   \r\n          tion;  indeed, Justice Blackmun argued unsuc-\r\n          cessfully for much the same  sort of particu-\r\n          larized inquiry . . . . Whether it was feasi-\r\n          ble  for the  police to  obtain a  warrant in\r\n          this  particular case  is irrelevant  for the\r\n          purpose at hand.\r\n\nCardona,  903 F.2d  at  68 n.7  (emphasis added;  citations omit-\r                 \r\n\nted).10    Although  the  Fourth  Amendment  warrant  requirement\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10There  is  no record  evidence  that  the challenged  City\r\npolicy required officers to  execute pink papers within a  speci-\r\nfied time.  In all  events, however, we do not think  the several\r\nhours that elapsed  between the  issuance and  execution of  this\r\npink paper, which enabled the constable and police  to coordinate\r\ntheir  actions, can be considered  so inordinate as  to call into\r\nquestion  the  emergent  nature of  Ms.  Zinger's  mental-health-\r\nrelated  dangerousness.    Whereas  delay  might  belie  \"exigent\r\ncircumstances,\" were that the  warrant exception primarily relied\r\nupon by the City, no  such rigid time constraints can  be imposed\r\nin  a particular  \"special need\"  case as  a precondition  to the\r\nvalidity of  the systemic search procedure  itself.  Nonetheless,\r\nwe  express no opinion as to whether, in another case, inordinate\r\ndelay in issuing and executing a pink paper might tend  to under-\r\nmine a predicate finding  that the subject posed a  real \"likeli-\r\nhood of serious harm\" at the time the finding was made. \r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nimposes a  minimal burden  on governmental authorities  in normal\r\n\ncircumstances, we think there  can be little doubt that  it would\r\n\ndelay  the execution  of  involuntary commitment  orders to  some\r                                                                           \r\n\ndegree in all cases,  thereby appreciably increasing the systemic\r                       \r\n\nrisk  that the vital  protective purposes  served by  the State's\r\n\nparens patriae  and  \"police  power\"  responsibilities  would  be\r                        \r\n\nfrustrated in individual cases not identifiable  in advance.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nsupra Section II.D.1(a).\r               \r\n\n          More  importantly  by   far,  however,  the  additional\r\n\nburdens  imposed on  the City  and State  by a  universal warrant\r\n\nrequirement in category 2 searches seem to us \"undue\" and \"unrea-\r\n\nsonable\"  when  viewed  in  relation to  the  minimal  additional\r\n\nprotection  afforded  by a  requirement  that  a  pink  paper  be\r\n\nscreened by a  magistrate before  it is executed.   The  district\r\n\ncourt  ruled that  the Fourth  Amendment warrant  requirement was\r\n\nviolated notwithstanding compliance with  the \"pink paper\" proce-\r\n\ndure under  Mass. Gen.

On the other hand,\r                                 \r\n\nthe Supreme Court  has noted  that rigid adherence  to a  warrant\r\n\nrequirement  reaches its  most suspect  extreme where  a judicial\r\n\nofficer lacks the innate expertise to assess the soundness of the\r\n\nbasic  ground upon which the warrant request is predicated.

On  the other  hand,  the statutory  mechanism\r\n\nitself affords  reasonable safeguards  against such concerns:   a\r\n\npink paper  can  be authorized  only  by a  licensed  psychiatric\r\n\nphysician,  see Mass. Gen.

Nonetheless, the\r\nother safeguards do mitigate any resulting injury to the subject.\r\nFor example, in order  to detain a dangerous mentally  ill person\r\nfor  more than  ten days,  the State  must petition  the district\r\ncourt, and prove beyond reasonable doubt that the patient poses a\r\n\"likelihood of serious harm.\"  See Mass.

See Steagald, 451  U.S. at 212\r                                                         \r\n\n(noting that the Fourth Amendment warrant  requirement interposes\r\n\n\"neutral\"  and  detached  judicial  officer  between  police  and\r\n\n\"probable  cause\" determination).

See Cardona, 903 F.2d at 64-65 (\"The [Griffin]\r                                                                          \r\n\nCourt's  focus was on the degree of security inherent in allowing\r\n\na particular decisionmaker, i.e., a  probation officer, to make a\r\n\nparticular decision, i.e., whether a probationer's home should be\r\n\nsearched,  based on  a  particular (relatively  modest) level  of\r\n\nproof, i.e.,  `reasonable grounds.'\").  Unlike the characteristic\r\n\nrelationship  between  law  enforcement  personnel  and  criminal\r\n\nsuspects, a  committing physician's relationship with  a patient,\r\n\nor even a nonpatient, is in no sense adversarial.  \r\n\n          The role of the licensed physician  under Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw is to provide a neutral, objective assessment of the \"danger-\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nousness\" and \"likelihood of serious risk\" criteria upon which the\r\n\ninvoluntary commitment  decision depends.  A  physician's ethical\r\n\nresponsibilities  likewise  require  that   appropriate  medical-\r\n\npsychiatric criteria  be utilized  in assessing the  condition of\r\n\nthe subject  person.

Laws Ann. ch. 123,   12(a), however, the decision to conduct\r\n\na  category 2 \"search\" is  never left to  the executing officers.\r\n\nMoreover, the  mere fact that law enforcement  officials serve as\r\n\nthe agents who implement  the authorizing physician's decision to\r\n\napprove  a category 2 search  does not necessarily  mean that the\r\n\nprocedure is not within the \"special need\" category: \r\n\n          [W]e fail to see any  constitutional signifi-\r\n          cance in the fact that police officers, rath-\r\n          er than \"administrative\" agents,  are permit-\r\n          ted to conduct the    415-a5 inspection.  The\r\n          significance respondent alleges  lies in  the\r\n          role of police  officers as enforcers  of the\r\n          penal  laws  and in  the  officers'  power to\r\n          arrest  for offenses other than violations of\r\n          the administrative  scheme.  It  is, however,\r\n          important to note that state police officers,\r\n          like those in New York, have numerous  duties\r\n          in addition  to those associated  with tradi-\r\n          tional  police work.  .  . .  As a  practical\r\n          matter, many States do not have the resources\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nissued  by the  subject-patient's current  or former  psychiatric\r\nphysician.  Unlike law  enforcement officers, who rarely interact\r\nwith a  search target on more than one occasion, as a rule physi-\r\ncians  possess  reliable personal  knowledge  of their  patients,\r\nbased on  an ongoing  doctor-patient relationship.

We do not suggest\r\n\nthat the factors we have discussed, see Section II.D, alone or in\r                                                 \r\n\ncombination invariably  provide adequate  support for  a \"special\r\n\nneed\"  exception to the warrant  requirement.  The balancing test\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nfor determining whether an  administrative procedure comes within\r\n\nthe  \"special need\"  exception is  designedly fact-specific,  and\r\n\nmust  be calibrated anew in assessing  the reasonableness of each\r\n\nadministrative  search procedure to which it is applied.

The district court granted summary judgment for plaintiff Mary McCabe, administratrix of the estate of Ruchla Zinger, a Holocaust survivor who died in her Lynn home during a tragic attempt by City police to execute an involuntary commitment order which had been issued against her.   For the reasons discussed in this opinion, we conclude that the challenged City policy came within an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Zinger, a 64-year-old Lynn, Massachusetts, resident with a history of mental illness and psychiatric hospitalization, as well as severe obesity and high blood pressure, resisted all attempts at communication and intervention by family members.   She refused to be examined by a doctor after threatening her former husband with physical harm and upsetting her downstairs neighbors by causing loud and violent disturbances in her apartment, thereby prompting her family to initiate eviction proceedings against her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Subsequently, on September 6, 1989, a licensed psychiatrist, Dr. Jakov Barden, signed an application [hereinafter:  \"pink paper\"] for a ten-day involuntary commitment of Ms. Zinger pursuant to Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), based exclusively on the reports of family members and neighbors as to Ms. Zinger's physical and behavioral symptoms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next morning, Constable Kenneth Jackson, who had been unsuccessful in previous attempts to serve Ms. Zinger with an eviction notice, and was scheduled to execute a judgment of eviction against her at 1:00 p.m. that afternoon, learned that the pink paper had been issued against Ms. Zinger the night before, and contacted the Lynn police department.   The constable informed the Lynn police, based on his experience with Ms. Zinger, that he believed she would resist committal.   The constable and the Lynn police officers arranged to meet at the Zinger apartment building at 1:00 p.m., to execute the pink paper and the eviction order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three Lynn police officers and the constable arrived at the Zinger apartment building at the appointed hour, accompanied by a crew from the Life-Line Ambulance Service, which had been engaged to restrain Ms. Zinger as necessary, physically remove her from the apartment, and transport her to the hospital.   After receiving no response to their knocks, the officers kicked in the outside apartment-house door and proceeded upstairs to the Zinger apartment.   The officers knocked and announced their presence, received no response, and began to kick in the Zinger apartment door.   Ms. Zinger began screaming \"Why are you kicking in my door?\" then cracked it open.   Identifying themselves as police, the officers told her that they were going to bring her under medical care, to which she responded:  \"No doctors!\"   When she began to close the door, the officers shoved their way inside.   Later, while the officers were forcibly removing her from the apartment, Ms. Zinger suffered a cardio-respiratory arrest and died.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After McCabe, as administratrix, instituted this civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 against the City, amongst others,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> in September 1992, an amended complaint alleged an established City policy permitting police officers to execute pink papers by means of forcible, warrantless entries into private residences absent demonstrable exigent circumstances, and that this City policy proximately caused an actionable deprivation of Ms. Zinger's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  After hearing, the district court granted the McCabe cross-motion for summary judgment against the City on the issue of liability.

The City thereupon brought this appeal from the final judgment entered against it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. District Court Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the City policy violated the Fourth Amendment, for the following reasons.   The City's own policy expert attested that the City did not require its officers to obtain a search warrant before effecting a warrantless entry of a residence to execute a pink paper, leaving it instead to the discretion of the officers whether and when such a warrantless entry was necessary.  Id. at 58.   The district court noted that warrantless, nonconsensual entries into private residences are presumptively \"unreasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment, absent exigent circumstances.  Id. at 58-59.   Although imminent threats to the lives and safety of the police officers, or members of the public, often give rise to exigent circumstances justifying an immediate warrantless entry, the court found that \"the Lynn police acted with leisure in arranging a convenient time\" to serve the pink paper upon Ms. Zinger, thereby belying any contention that \" 'some real[,] immediate or serious consequences [would occur] if [the officers] postponed action to get a warrant.' \"  Id. at 59, 62 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court nonetheless recognized that even absent exigent circumstances the warrant requirement may not be applicable in certain regulatory contexts wherein warrantless search procedures serve as invaluable \"administrative tool[s]\" and are \"far less invasive\" than searches directed at discovering evidence of crime.  Id. at 59-60.   The court identified two factors which weighed against a ruling that the challenged City policy came within this special regulatory category.   First, unlike a judicial officer, the licensed medical-psychiatric physicians authorized to issue pink papers under Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), are \"not qualified to determine whether probable cause exists.\"  Id. at 61.   Second, \"the agents of the doctors in this case are police officers with guns and batons, not hospital orderlies and nurses,\" so that \"[t]here is no therapeutic relationship which a warrant mechanism would disrupt.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

See United States v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 969 (1st Cir.1995);  Hegarty, 53 F.3d at 1374.   Normally, \"exigent circumstances\" exceptions--by their very nature--turn upon the objective reasonableness of ad hoc, fact-specific assessments contemporaneously made by government agents in light of the developing circumstances at the scene of the search.

Oddly, none of the cases the City cites as support for the constitutionality of comparable involuntary commitment statutes deals straightforwardly with the precise issue before us:  whether a prescribed statutory search procedure (i.e., Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a)) violates the Fourth Amendment because it routinely allows warrantless entries of a residence, absent \"exigent circumstances,\" to effect involuntary commitments;  nor have we found such a case.   The cases cited by the City consider whether a seizure of the person effected pursuant to an involuntary commitment statute violates the due process requirements of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> or whether the manner in which the government detains a person violates the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable seizures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Nonetheless, to the extent the technically inapposite \"seizure\" cases relied on by the City might be considered appropriate analogs in this unchartered area, we consult their reasoning for guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties devote considerable attention to whether there remains a genuine factual dispute regarding the substance of the challenged City \"policy,\" we consider its essential features clear enough;  that is, the policy permits warrantless residential searches, without requiring \"exigent circumstances,\" in order to effect an involuntary commitment pursuant to a properly issued pink paper.   Of course, the City argues that every entry is per se \"exigent\" since a pink paper can only issue upon an expert medical finding that the subject presently poses a \"likelihood of serious harm\" to herself or others, which in turn provides the police with reasonable cause to believe that an immediate, forcible entry for the purpose of detaining the resistant subject is necessary to avert the \"serious harm\" identified in the pink paper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, McCabe contends that these remote medical-psychiatric \"emergency\" determinations do not equate with constitutionally cognizable \"exigent circumstances,\" because they do not turn on the executing officer's fact-specific, on-the-scene assessment as to the immediacy of any putative threat the subject may pose to herself or others.   McCabe stresses that during the several hours which were allowed to elapse before the pink paper was executed upon Ms. Zinger, the officers would have had ample time to obtain a search warrant.   And McCabe points out that none of the four recognized \"exigent circumstances,\" see supra p. 545, was plainly present immediately before the forcible policy entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As these claims reflect the legal gloss placed on the record evidence, rather than a genuine factual dispute concerning the substance of the City policy, we need not enter the skirmish over the distinctions between \"emergencies\" and \"exigent circumstances.\"   The City policy, as evidenced by the actual conduct of its police officers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> falls squarely within a recognized class of systemic \"special need\" searches which are conducted without warrants in furtherance of important administrative purposes.   Again, the fundamental concern of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in general, and in \"special need\" search cases as well, is whether an established search procedure is \"reasonable\" in light of the actual circumstances in the particular case.   See Cady, 413 U.S. at 439-40, 93 S.Ct. at 2527;  see also O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 719, 107 S.Ct. at 1498;  T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 337, 105 S.Ct. at 740.  \"Reasonableness,\" in turn, depends on \" 'balanc[ing] the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.' \"  O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 719, 107 S.Ct. at 1498 (citation omitted);  see T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 341, 105 S.Ct. at 742-43;  Cardona, 903 F.2d at 67;  cf. Villanova, 972 F.2d at 796.   On balance, we find that the City policy permitting forcible, warrantless entries by police officers in possession of a pink paper properly issued pursuant to Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

See Rogers v. Okin, 634 F.2d 650, 654 (1st Cir.1980), rev'd on other grounds, 457 U.S. 291, 102 S.Ct. 2442, 73 L.Ed.2d 16 (1982);  Thompson v. Commonwealth, 386 Mass. 811, 438 N.E.2d 33, 36 (1982).   The potential consequences attending a delayed commitment--both to the mentally ill subject and others--may be extremely serious, sometimes including death or bodily injury.   Thus, we think it is especially significant to the present analysis that warrantless \"special need\" searches have been condoned by the courts in circumstances where the State interests were far less compelling and urgent.   Cf., e.g., O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 724, 107 S.Ct. at 1501 (noting:  because \"public employees are entrusted with tremendous responsibility,\" \"the consequences of their misconduct or incompetence to both the agency and the public interest can be severe\");  New York v.

As only the category 4 commitment procedure expressly incorporates a warrant requirement, we think it clear that the statute implicitly authorizes warrantless searches and seizures in the three remaining contexts.   Since Ms. Zinger repeatedly rejected family pleas that she submit to examination by a physician, and because Dr. Barden based his expert medical-psychiatric opinion exclusively on reports from family members and neighbors, we conclude also that the pink paper in this case did issue under category 2.   The only question before us, therefore, concerns the constitutionality of the \"category 2\" warrantless search procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pink paper was based on Dr. Barden's expert opinion that Ms. Zinger \"require[d] hospitalization so as to avoid the likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness.\"   Dr. Barden described the particular grounds for concluding that immediate hospitalization was required:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>[Patient] has a [history] of mental illness and she was hospitalized at Danvers [State] Hospital couple of years ago.

The relevant medical history, including Ms. Zinger's history of mental illness and prior hospitalization at Danvers State Hospital, and the behavioral symptoms reported to Dr. Barden by family members, plainly satisfied the second clause in the statutory definition of \"likelihood of serious harm.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory definition of \"likelihood of serious harm,\" particularly its requirement that there be objective medical indicia of \"dangerousness,\" effectively \"constitutes a codified set of 'exigent circumstances' which are constitutional under the Fourth Amendment.\"  Moore v.

Given the notorious difficulties in predicting individual human behavior based solely on symptomatology, id. at 1539, we conclude that Mass.  Gen.

A police officer is permitted to enter a residence without a warrant for the exclusive purpose of detaining a recalcitrant and dangerous mentally ill person pursuant to a duly issued pink paper, but may not engage in a generalized search.   As the officers in the instant case did not exceed these bounds, we conclude that Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), and consequently the City policy in pursuance of the statutory design, see supra pps. 546-47, are appropriately tailored to serve the legitimate and important State and municipal interest in ensuring that dangerous mentally ill persons not cause physical harm to themselves or others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Practicality of Warrant Requirement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The determination that there exists a legitimate and substantial governmental interest in conducting a warrantless search in certain circumstances satisfies only the threshold inquiry under the reasonableness test.   For an administrative search procedure to survive constitutional challenge under the \"special need\" exception, it must also appear that the burdens of complying with a warrant requirement are likely to defeat the important governmental purposes the warrantless search procedure was designed to serve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>In assessing whether the public interest demands creation of a general exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, the question is not whether the public interest justifies the type of search in question, but whether the authority to search should be evidenced by a warrant, which in turn depends in part upon whether the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camara, 387 U.S. at 533, 87 S.Ct. at 1733.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Compliance with a warrant requirement in the context of these temporary, involuntary commitments for medical-psychiatric examination would entail critical delays in safeguarding the mentally ill person, and others, without affording commensurate privacy protections to the subject.   Category 2 searches foster important governmental interests largely because the inherent imprecision in predicting the timing of any outbreak of \"dangerousness\" on the part of the recalcitrant, mentally ill person, see Moore, 825 F.Supp. at 1539, inevitably means that the time spent securing judicial approval of a pink paper represents a potentially dangerous delay of incalculable proportion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this particular case, of course, McCabe points to the undisputed evidence that the police officers waited several hours before executing the pink paper, thus demonstrating little concern that Ms. Zinger might exhibit the sort of sudden onset of \"dangerousness\" alluded to in the assessment made by Dr. Barden.   Although this argument might hold sway were the constitutionality of the warrantless entry dependent on an ad hoc, on-the-scene \"exigent circumstances\" determination made by the police, it is no rejoinder to the claimed \"reasonableness\" of a \"special need\" search procedure policy, which must focus not on the particular case but on the essential systemic attributes of the search procedure itself:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>The dissent argues that in this case the police had ample time to secure an arrest warrant, rendering invalid any claim that complying with traditional fourth amendment requirements was impracticable.   That viewpoint distorts Griffin 's \"impracticability\" prong.   In Griffin, the Court inquired into the systemic impracticability of compelling those involved in implementation of a probation regime to obtain warrants.   The impracticability of obtaining a warrant in the particular case did not enter into the equation;  indeed, Justice Blackmun argued unsuccessfully for much the same sort of particularized inquiry....  Whether it was feasible for the police to obtain a warrant in this particular case is irrelevant for the purpose at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardona, 903 F.2d at 68 n. 7 (emphasis added;  citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Although the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement imposes a minimal burden on governmental authorities in normal circumstances, we think there can be little doubt that it would delay the execution of involuntary commitment orders to some degree in all cases, thereby appreciably increasing the systemic risk that the vital protective purposes served by the State's parens patriae and \"police power\" responsibilities would be frustrated in individual cases not identifiable in advance.

The district court ruled that the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement was violated notwithstanding compliance with the \"pink paper\" procedure under Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), because the issuing physician \"is not qualified to determine whether probable cause exists.\"  McCabe, 875 F.Supp. at 61.   On the other hand, the Supreme Court has noted that rigid adherence to a warrant requirement reaches its most suspect extreme where a judicial officer lacks the inmate expertise to assess the soundness of the basic ground upon which the warrant request is predicated.   See, e.g., Griffin, 483 U.S. at 879 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. at 3171 n. 6 (observing that \"[o]ur discussion pertains to the reasons generally supporting the proposition that the search decision should be left to the expertise of probation authorities rather than a magistrate\");  cf.

In the latter cases the basic issue is a straightforward factual question--did the accused commit the act alleged?   There may be factual issues to resolve in a commitment proceeding, but the factual aspects represent only the beginning of the inquiry.   Whether the individual is mentally ill and dangerous to either himself or others and is in need of confined therapy turns on the meaning of the facts which must be interpreted by expert psychiatrists and psychologists.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Project Release v.

On the other hand, the statutory mechanism itself affords reasonable safeguards against such concerns:  a pink paper can be authorized only by a licensed psychiatric physician, see Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167;&#167; 1, 12(a), whose extensive education and specialized experience and training should enable the psychiatric physician more reliably to parse such lay reports, especially those provided by family members, with the requisite professional skepticism.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Though this safeguard is by no means foolproof, we think it would be the exceptional case in which an expert evaluation was based on patently insufficient or unreliable information.   Further, to the degree that judicial factfinding were thought to be necessary as a general rule, in order to ferret out latent unreliability in the foundational evidence (e.g., possible ulterior family motives or antipathy toward the patient) upon which expert psychiatric evaluations are based, the resulting delays in implementing involuntary commitment orders could have far more serious consequences for the mentally ill, their families, and members of the public.   Finally, such a detailed factfinding mission would greatly exceed any \"screening\" function normally undertaken by judicial officers in reviewing search warrant applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no sufficient justification for superimposing such a judicial factfinding mechanism upon the evaluation made by the licensed psychiatric physician in the involuntary commitment context, especially since it promises no corresponding systemic benefit to offset the systemic delays in executing pink papers in emergent circumstances.   See Griffin, 483 U.S. at 876, 107 S.Ct. at 3170 (\"A warrant requirement would interfere to an appreciable degree with the probation system, setting up a magistrate rather than the probation officer as the judge of how close a supervision the probationer requires.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

See T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 341, 105 S.Ct. at 742-43;  cf. also, Rockwell, 26 F.3d at 256 (\"Involuntary confinement for compulsory psychiatric treatment is a 'massive curtailment of liberty.' \")  (quoting Humphrey v. Cady, 405 U.S. 504, 509, 92 S.Ct. 1048, 1052, 31 L.Ed.2d 394 (1972)) (citation omitted).   We point out again, however, that McCabe presently challenges only the alleged infringement of Ms. Zinger's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable governmental entries to her residence, see supra note 2, and does not allege an infringement of her liberty interest to be free from any unreasonable governmental restraint attending the subsequent seizure of her person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Civil Context</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Fourth Amendment is implicated in a variety of civil proceedings, Soldal, 506 U.S. at 69-71, 113 S.Ct. at 548, the Supreme Court has made it clear that the civil nature of certain search procedures may call for a narrowed application of the warrant and probable cause requirements.   Where a search procedure is not designed to gather information in a criminal investigation, its relative unintrusiveness may militate in favor of relaxing the warrant requirement.   See O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 721, 107 S.Ct. at 1499 (\"While police, and even [some] administrative enforcement personnel, conduct searches for the primary purpose of obtaining evidence for use in criminal or other enforcement proceedings, employers most frequently need to enter the offices and desks of their employees for legitimate work-related reasons wholly unrelated to illegal conduct.\");  Wyman, 400 U.S. at 323, 91 S.Ct. at 389 (home visitation program \"does not deal with crime or with the actual or suspected perpetrators of crime,\" and \"[t]he caseworker is not a sleuth but rather, we trust, ... a friend to one in need\");  see also Project Release, 722 F.2d at 972-73 (\"[T]he difference between civil and criminal confinement may nonetheless be reflected in different standards and procedures applicable in the context of each of the two systems--so long as due process is satisfied.\")  (citing Addington, 441 U.S. at 425, 99 S.Ct. at 1809).   In the instant case, McCabe has not suggested that the challenged entry of the Zinger residence was effected for any criminal law purpose, or any regulatory purpose other than to enable her temporary hospitalization and the psychiatric examination she adamantly refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Impartiality of Decisionmaker</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it is most significant in the present context that the official decision to initiate an involuntary \"category 2\" commitment rests with a licensed psychiatric physician, not with law enforcement officials.   See Steagald, 451 U.S. at 212, 101 S.Ct. at 1647-48 (noting that the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement interposes \"neutral\" and detached judicial officer between police and \"probable cause\" determination).   The Supreme Court consistently premises \"special need\" warrant exceptions on the presence of a search authorization by an impartial, or at least a relatively impartial person.   See Cardona, 903 F.2d at 64-65 (\"The [Griffin ] Court's focus was on the degree of security inherent in allowing a particular decisionmaker, i.e., a probation officer, to make a particular decision, i.e., whether a probationer's home should be searched, based on a particular (relatively modest) level of proof, i.e., 'reasonable grounds.' \").   Unlike the characteristic relationship between law enforcement personnel and criminal suspects, a committing physician's relationship with a patient, or even a nonpatient, is in no sense adversarial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The role of the licensed physician under Massachusetts law is to provide a neutral, objective assessment of the \"dangerousness\" and \"likelihood of serious risk\" criteria upon which the involuntary commitment decision depends.   A physician's ethical responsibilities likewise require that appropriate medical-psychiatric criteria be utilized in assessing the condition of the subject person.   Cf., e.g., Griffin, 483 U.S. at 876, 107 S.Ct. at 3170 (\"Although a probation officer is not an impartial magistrate, neither is he the police officer who normally conducts searches against the ordinary citizen.   He is an employee of the State Department of Health and Social Services who, while assuredly charged with protecting the public interest, is also supposed to have in mind the welfare of the probationer.\").   Nor is there any allegation or evidence that the Lynn police possessed or exercised any influence, direct or indirect, over the medical-psychiatric decision to issue the pink paper.   Cf. T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 337 n. 5, 105 S.Ct. at 740 n. 5 (\"Nor do we express any opinion on the standards (if any) governing searches of such areas by school officials or by other public authorities acting at the request of school officials.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court nonetheless struck down the City policy because \"the agents of the doctors in this case are police officers with guns and batons, not hospital orderlies and nurses,\" so that \"[t]here is no therapeutic relationship which a warrant mechanism would disrupt.\"  McCabe, 875 F.Supp. at 61.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Whether an administrative search procedure leaves too much discretion to law enforcement officers in the field is a recurring Fourth Amendment concern.   See, e.g., Camara, 387 U.S. at 532-33, 87 S.Ct. at 1733 (\"The practical effect of this system is to leave the occupant subject to the discretion of the official in the field.   This is precisely the discretion to invade private property which we have consistently circumscribed by a requirement that a disinterested party warrant the need to search.\").   Under Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), however, the decision to conduct a category 2 \"search\" is never left to the executing officers.   Moreover, the mere fact that law enforcement officials serve as the agents who implement the authorizing physician's decision to approve a category 2 search does not necessarily mean that the procedure is not within the \"special need\" category:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>[W]e fail to see any constitutional significance in the fact that police officers, rather than \"administrative\" agents, are permitted to conduct the &#167; 415-a5 inspection.   The significance respondent alleges lies in the role of police officers as enforcers of the penal laws and in the officers' power to arrest for offenses other than violations of the administrative scheme.   It is, however, important to note that state police officers, like those in New York, have numerous duties in addition to those associated with traditional police work....  As a practical matter, many States do not have the resources to assign the enforcement of a particular administrative scheme to a specialized agency.   So long as a regulatory scheme is properly administrative, it is not rendered illegal by the fact that the inspecting officer has the power to arrest individuals for violations other than those created by the scheme itself.   In sum, we decline to impose upon the States the burden of requiring the enforcement of their regulatory statutes to be carried out by specialized agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burger, 482 U.S. at 717-18, 107 S.Ct. at 2651;  Cardona, 903 F.2d at 65 (\"The [Griffin ] Court did not lend any special salience to the identity of the person(s) executing the search\";  \"[w]hether the decision, once reached [by the probation officer], is realized through police officers, parole officers, or a tag team representing both camps, is peripheral to the Court's holding.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that these considerations, on balance, favor a limited \"special need\" exception to the warrant requirement in the particular setting presented in this case.   Accordingly, we hold that the Fourth Amendment is not infringed by the challenged City policy, which authorizes warrantless entries of residences by the police for the sole purpose of executing a properly issued category 2 pink paper within a reasonable time after its issuance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We retrace the bounds of our ruling.   We do not suggest that the factors we have discussed, see Section II.D, alone or in combination invariably provide adequate support for a \"special need\" exception to the warrant requirement.   The balancing test for determining whether an administrative procedure comes within the \"special need\" exception is designedly fact-specific, and must be calibrated anew in assessing the reasonableness of each administrative search procedure to which it is applied.   Nor, of course, do we suggest that all comparable state involuntary commitment statutes, or any other provision of Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, or other categories of searches authorized under chapter 123, section 12(a), necessarily satisfy the Fourth Amendment.   See, e.g., Wyman, 400 U.S. at 326, 91 S.Ct. at 390 (\"Our holding today does not mean ... that a termination of benefits upon refusal of a home visit is to be upheld against constitutional challenge under all conceivable circumstances.   The early morning mass raid upon homes of welfare recipients is not unknown.\").   We hold only that law enforcement officers in possession of a pink paper, duly issued pursuant to category 2, Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), may effect a warrantless entry of the subject's residence within a reasonable time after the pink paper issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the challenged City policy comports with the \"special need\" exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, the City is entitled to summary judgment.

The \"probable cause\" inquiry often is jettisoned in civil administrative searches:</p>\n        <p>\"[W]here a careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause, we have not hesitated to adopt such a standard.\"   We have concluded, for example, that the appropriate standard for administrative searches is not probable cause in its traditional meaning.   Instead, an administrative warrant can be obtained if there is a showing that reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an inspection are satisfied.</p>\n        <p>O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 722-23, 107 S.Ct. at 1500 (citations omitted);  see also T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 340-41, 105 S.Ct. at 742 (\" '[P]robable cause' is not an irreducible requirement of a valid search.

Nonetheless, the other safeguards do mitigate any resulting injury to the subject.   For example, in order to detain a dangerous mentally ill person for more than ten days, the State must petition the district court, and prove beyond reasonable doubt that the patient poses a \"likelihood of serious harm.\"   See Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167;&#167; 7, 8 (requiring ongoing, periodic judicial review of commitment decision), 12(d);  Commonwealth v.

The district court granted summary judgment for plaintiff Mary McCabe, administratrix of the estate of Ruchla Zinger, a Holocaust survivor who died in her Lynn home during a tragic attempt by City police to execute an involuntary commitment order which had been issued against her.   For the reasons discussed in this opinion, we conclude that the challenged City policy came within an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Zinger, a 64-year-old Lynn, Massachusetts, resident with a history of mental illness and psychiatric hospitalization, as well as severe obesity and high blood pressure, resisted all attempts at communication and intervention by family members.   She refused to be examined by a doctor after threatening her former husband with physical harm and upsetting her downstairs neighbors by causing loud and violent disturbances in her apartment, thereby prompting her family to initiate eviction proceedings against her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Subsequently, on September 6, 1989, a licensed psychiatrist, Dr. Jakov Barden, signed an application [hereinafter:  \"pink paper\"] for a ten-day involuntary commitment of Ms. Zinger pursuant to Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), based exclusively on the reports of family members and neighbors as to Ms. Zinger's physical and behavioral symptoms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next morning, Constable Kenneth Jackson, who had been unsuccessful in previous attempts to serve Ms. Zinger with an eviction notice, and was scheduled to execute a judgment of eviction against her at 1:00 p.m. that afternoon, learned that the pink paper had been issued against Ms. Zinger the night before, and contacted the Lynn police department.   The constable informed the Lynn police, based on his experience with Ms. Zinger, that he believed she would resist committal.   The constable and the Lynn police officers arranged to meet at the Zinger apartment building at 1:00 p.m., to execute the pink paper and the eviction order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three Lynn police officers and the constable arrived at the Zinger apartment building at the appointed hour, accompanied by a crew from the Life-Line Ambulance Service, which had been engaged to restrain Ms. Zinger as necessary, physically remove her from the apartment, and transport her to the hospital.   After receiving no response to their knocks, the officers kicked in the outside apartment-house door and proceeded upstairs to the Zinger apartment.   The officers knocked and announced their presence, received no response, and began to kick in the Zinger apartment door.   Ms. Zinger began screaming \"Why are you kicking in my door?\" then cracked it open.   Identifying themselves as police, the officers told her that they were going to bring her under medical care, to which she responded:  \"No doctors!\"   When she began to close the door, the officers shoved their way inside.   Later, while the officers were forcibly removing her from the apartment, Ms. Zinger suffered a cardio-respiratory arrest and died.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After McCabe, as administratrix, instituted this civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 against the City, amongst others,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> in September 1992, an amended complaint alleged an established City policy permitting police officers to execute pink papers by means of forcible, warrantless entries into private residences absent demonstrable exigent circumstances, and that this City policy proximately caused an actionable deprivation of Ms. Zinger's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  After hearing, the district court granted the McCabe cross-motion for summary judgment against the City on the issue of liability.

The City thereupon brought this appeal from the final judgment entered against it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. District Court Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the City policy violated the Fourth Amendment, for the following reasons.   The City's own policy expert attested that the City did not require its officers to obtain a search warrant before effecting a warrantless entry of a residence to execute a pink paper, leaving it instead to the discretion of the officers whether and when such a warrantless entry was necessary.  Id. at 58.   The district court noted that warrantless, nonconsensual entries into private residences are presumptively \"unreasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment, absent exigent circumstances.  Id. at 58-59.   Although imminent threats to the lives and safety of the police officers, or members of the public, often give rise to exigent circumstances justifying an immediate warrantless entry, the court found that \"the Lynn police acted with leisure in arranging a convenient time\" to serve the pink paper upon Ms. Zinger, thereby belying any contention that \" 'some real[,] immediate or serious consequences [would occur] if [the officers] postponed action to get a warrant.' \"  Id. at 59, 62 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court nonetheless recognized that even absent exigent circumstances the warrant requirement may not be applicable in certain regulatory contexts wherein warrantless search procedures serve as invaluable \"administrative tool[s]\" and are \"far less invasive\" than searches directed at discovering evidence of crime.  Id. at 59-60.   The court identified two factors which weighed against a ruling that the challenged City policy came within this special regulatory category.   First, unlike a judicial officer, the licensed medical-psychiatric physicians authorized to issue pink papers under Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), are \"not qualified to determine whether probable cause exists.\"  Id. at 61.   Second, \"the agents of the doctors in this case are police officers with guns and batons, not hospital orderlies and nurses,\" so that \"[t]here is no therapeutic relationship which a warrant mechanism would disrupt.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

Oddly, none of the cases the City cites as support for the constitutionality of comparable involuntary commitment statutes deals straightforwardly with the precise issue before us:  whether a prescribed statutory search procedure (i.e., Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a)) violates the Fourth Amendment because it routinely allows warrantless entries of a residence, absent \"exigent circumstances,\" to effect involuntary commitments;  nor have we found such a case.   The cases cited by the City consider whether a seizure of the person effected pursuant to an involuntary commitment statute violates the due process requirements of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> or whether the manner in which the government detains a person violates the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable seizures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Nonetheless, to the extent the technically inapposite \"seizure\" cases relied on by the City might be considered appropriate analogs in this unchartered area, we consult their reasoning for guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties devote considerable attention to whether there remains a genuine factual dispute regarding the substance of the challenged City \"policy,\" we consider its essential features clear enough;  that is, the policy permits warrantless residential searches, without requiring \"exigent circumstances,\" in order to effect an involuntary commitment pursuant to a properly issued pink paper.   Of course, the City argues that every entry is per se \"exigent\" since a pink paper can only issue upon an expert medical finding that the subject presently poses a \"likelihood of serious harm\" to herself or others, which in turn provides the police with reasonable cause to believe that an immediate, forcible entry for the purpose of detaining the resistant subject is necessary to avert the \"serious harm\" identified in the pink paper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, McCabe contends that these remote medical-psychiatric \"emergency\" determinations do not equate with constitutionally cognizable \"exigent circumstances,\" because they do not turn on the executing officer's fact-specific, on-the-scene assessment as to the immediacy of any putative threat the subject may pose to herself or others.   McCabe stresses that during the several hours which were allowed to elapse before the pink paper was executed upon Ms. Zinger, the officers would have had ample time to obtain a search warrant.   And McCabe points out that none of the four recognized \"exigent circumstances,\" see supra p. 545, was plainly present immediately before the forcible policy entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As these claims reflect the legal gloss placed on the record evidence, rather than a genuine factual dispute concerning the substance of the City policy, we need not enter the skirmish over the distinctions between \"emergencies\" and \"exigent circumstances.\"   The City policy, as evidenced by the actual conduct of its police officers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> falls squarely within a recognized class of systemic \"special need\" searches which are conducted without warrants in furtherance of important administrative purposes.   Again, the fundamental concern of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in general, and in \"special need\" search cases as well, is whether an established search procedure is \"reasonable\" in light of the actual circumstances in the particular case.   See Cady, 413 U.S. at 439-40, 93 S.Ct. at 2527;  see also O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 719, 107 S.Ct. at 1498;  T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 337, 105 S.Ct. at 740.  \"Reasonableness,\" in turn, depends on \" 'balanc[ing] the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.' \"  O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 719, 107 S.Ct. at 1498 (citation omitted);  see T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 341, 105 S.Ct. at 742-43;  Cardona, 903 F.2d at 67;  cf. Villanova, 972 F.2d at 796.   On balance, we find that the City policy permitting forcible, warrantless entries by police officers in possession of a pink paper properly issued pursuant to Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

The potential consequences attending a delayed commitment--both to the mentally ill subject and others--may be extremely serious, sometimes including death or bodily injury.

As only the category 4 commitment procedure expressly incorporates a warrant requirement, we think it clear that the statute implicitly authorizes warrantless searches and seizures in the three remaining contexts.   Since Ms. Zinger repeatedly rejected family pleas that she submit to examination by a physician, and because Dr. Barden based his expert medical-psychiatric opinion exclusively on reports from family members and neighbors, we conclude also that the pink paper in this case did issue under category 2.

Given the notorious difficulties in predicting individual human behavior based solely on symptomatology, id. at 1539, we conclude that Mass.  Gen.

A police officer is permitted to enter a residence without a warrant for the exclusive purpose of detaining a recalcitrant and dangerous mentally ill person pursuant to a duly issued pink paper, but may not engage in a generalized search.   As the officers in the instant case did not exceed these bounds, we conclude that Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), and consequently the City policy in pursuance of the statutory design, see supra pps. 546-47, are appropriately tailored to serve the legitimate and important State and municipal interest in ensuring that dangerous mentally ill persons not cause physical harm to themselves or others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Practicality of Warrant Requirement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The determination that there exists a legitimate and substantial governmental interest in conducting a warrantless search in certain circumstances satisfies only the threshold inquiry under the reasonableness test.   For an administrative search procedure to survive constitutional challenge under the \"special need\" exception, it must also appear that the burdens of complying with a warrant requirement are likely to defeat the important governmental purposes the warrantless search procedure was designed to serve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>In assessing whether the public interest demands creation of a general exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, the question is not whether the public interest justifies the type of search in question, but whether the authority to search should be evidenced by a warrant, which in turn depends in part upon whether the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camara, 387 U.S. at 533, 87 S.Ct. at 1733.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Compliance with a warrant requirement in the context of these temporary, involuntary commitments for medical-psychiatric examination would entail critical delays in safeguarding the mentally ill person, and others, without affording commensurate privacy protections to the subject.   Category 2 searches foster important governmental interests largely because the inherent imprecision in predicting the timing of any outbreak of \"dangerousness\" on the part of the recalcitrant, mentally ill person, see Moore, 825 F.Supp. at 1539, inevitably means that the time spent securing judicial approval of a pink paper represents a potentially dangerous delay of incalculable proportion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this particular case, of course, McCabe points to the undisputed evidence that the police officers waited several hours before executing the pink paper, thus demonstrating little concern that Ms. Zinger might exhibit the sort of sudden onset of \"dangerousness\" alluded to in the assessment made by Dr. Barden.   Although this argument might hold sway were the constitutionality of the warrantless entry dependent on an ad hoc, on-the-scene \"exigent circumstances\" determination made by the police, it is no rejoinder to the claimed \"reasonableness\" of a \"special need\" search procedure policy, which must focus not on the particular case but on the essential systemic attributes of the search procedure itself:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>The dissent argues that in this case the police had ample time to secure an arrest warrant, rendering invalid any claim that complying with traditional fourth amendment requirements was impracticable.   That viewpoint distorts Griffin 's \"impracticability\" prong.   In Griffin, the Court inquired into the systemic impracticability of compelling those involved in implementation of a probation regime to obtain warrants.   The impracticability of obtaining a warrant in the particular case did not enter into the equation;  indeed, Justice Blackmun argued unsuccessfully for much the same sort of particularized inquiry....  Whether it was feasible for the police to obtain a warrant in this particular case is irrelevant for the purpose at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardona, 903 F.2d at 68 n. 7 (emphasis added;  citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Although the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement imposes a minimal burden on governmental authorities in normal circumstances, we think there can be little doubt that it would delay the execution of involuntary commitment orders to some degree in all cases, thereby appreciably increasing the systemic risk that the vital protective purposes served by the State's parens patriae and \"police power\" responsibilities would be frustrated in individual cases not identifiable in advance.   See supra Section II.D.1(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly by far, however, the additional burdens imposed on the City and State by a universal warrant requirement in category 2 searches seem to us \"undue\" and \"unreasonable\" when viewed in relation to the minimal additional protection afforded by a requirement that a pink paper be screened by a magistrate before it is executed.   The district court ruled that the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement was violated notwithstanding compliance with the \"pink paper\" procedure under Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), because the issuing physician \"is not qualified to determine whether probable cause exists.\"  McCabe, 875 F.Supp. at 61.   On the other hand, the Supreme Court has noted that rigid adherence to a warrant requirement reaches its most suspect extreme where a judicial officer lacks the inmate expertise to assess the soundness of the basic ground upon which the warrant request is predicated.   See, e.g., Griffin, 483 U.S. at 879 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. at 3171 n. 6 (observing that \"[o]ur discussion pertains to the reasons generally supporting the proposition that the search decision should be left to the expertise of probation authorities rather than a magistrate\");  cf. Rogers, 634 F.2d at 660 (\"While judicial determinations are certainly preferable in general, room must be left for responsible state officials to respond to exigencies that render totally impractical recourse to traditional forms of judicial process.

There may be factual issues to resolve in a commitment proceeding, but the factual aspects represent only the beginning of the inquiry.

On the other hand, the statutory mechanism itself affords reasonable safeguards against such concerns:  a pink paper can be authorized only by a licensed psychiatric physician, see Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167;&#167; 1, 12(a), whose extensive education and specialized experience and training should enable the psychiatric physician more reliably to parse such lay reports, especially those provided by family members, with the requisite professional skepticism.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Though this safeguard is by no means foolproof, we think it would be the exceptional case in which an expert evaluation was based on patently insufficient or unreliable information.   Further, to the degree that judicial factfinding were thought to be necessary as a general rule, in order to ferret out latent unreliability in the foundational evidence (e.g., possible ulterior family motives or antipathy toward the patient) upon which expert psychiatric evaluations are based, the resulting delays in implementing involuntary commitment orders could have far more serious consequences for the mentally ill, their families, and members of the public.   Finally, such a detailed factfinding mission would greatly exceed any \"screening\" function normally undertaken by judicial officers in reviewing search warrant applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no sufficient justification for superimposing such a judicial factfinding mechanism upon the evaluation made by the licensed psychiatric physician in the involuntary commitment context, especially since it promises no corresponding systemic benefit to offset the systemic delays in executing pink papers in emergent circumstances.   See Griffin, 483 U.S. at 876, 107 S.Ct. at 3170 (\"A warrant requirement would interfere to an appreciable degree with the probation system, setting up a magistrate rather than the probation officer as the judge of how close a supervision the probationer requires.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

We point out again, however, that McCabe presently challenges only the alleged infringement of Ms. Zinger's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable governmental entries to her residence, see supra note 2, and does not allege an infringement of her liberty interest to be free from any unreasonable governmental restraint attending the subsequent seizure of her person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Civil Context</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Fourth Amendment is implicated in a variety of civil proceedings, Soldal, 506 U.S. at 69-71, 113 S.Ct. at 548, the Supreme Court has made it clear that the civil nature of certain search procedures may call for a narrowed application of the warrant and probable cause requirements.   Where a search procedure is not designed to gather information in a criminal investigation, its relative unintrusiveness may militate in favor of relaxing the warrant requirement.   See O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 721, 107 S.Ct. at 1499 (\"While police, and even [some] administrative enforcement personnel, conduct searches for the primary purpose of obtaining evidence for use in criminal or other enforcement proceedings, employers most frequently need to enter the offices and desks of their employees for legitimate work-related reasons wholly unrelated to illegal conduct.\");  Wyman, 400 U.S. at 323, 91 S.Ct. at 389 (home visitation program \"does not deal with crime or with the actual or suspected perpetrators of crime,\" and \"[t]he caseworker is not a sleuth but rather, we trust, ... a friend to one in need\");  see also Project Release, 722 F.2d at 972-73 (\"[T]he difference between civil and criminal confinement may nonetheless be reflected in different standards and procedures applicable in the context of each of the two systems--so long as due process is satisfied.\")  (citing Addington, 441 U.S. at 425, 99 S.Ct. at 1809).   In the instant case, McCabe has not suggested that the challenged entry of the Zinger residence was effected for any criminal law purpose, or any regulatory purpose other than to enable her temporary hospitalization and the psychiatric examination she adamantly refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Impartiality of Decisionmaker</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it is most significant in the present context that the official decision to initiate an involuntary \"category 2\" commitment rests with a licensed psychiatric physician, not with law enforcement officials.   See Steagald, 451 U.S. at 212, 101 S.Ct. at 1647-48 (noting that the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement interposes \"neutral\" and detached judicial officer between police and \"probable cause\" determination).   The Supreme Court consistently premises \"special need\" warrant exceptions on the presence of a search authorization by an impartial, or at least a relatively impartial person.   See Cardona, 903 F.2d at 64-65 (\"The [Griffin ] Court's focus was on the degree of security inherent in allowing a particular decisionmaker, i.e., a probation officer, to make a particular decision, i.e., whether a probationer's home should be searched, based on a particular (relatively modest) level of proof, i.e., 'reasonable grounds.' \").   Unlike the characteristic relationship between law enforcement personnel and criminal suspects, a committing physician's relationship with a patient, or even a nonpatient, is in no sense adversarial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The role of the licensed physician under Massachusetts law is to provide a neutral, objective assessment of the \"dangerousness\" and \"likelihood of serious risk\" criteria upon which the involuntary commitment decision depends.   A physician's ethical responsibilities likewise require that appropriate medical-psychiatric criteria be utilized in assessing the condition of the subject person.   Cf., e.g., Griffin, 483 U.S. at 876, 107 S.Ct. at 3170 (\"Although a probation officer is not an impartial magistrate, neither is he the police officer who normally conducts searches against the ordinary citizen.   He is an employee of the State Department of Health and Social Services who, while assuredly charged with protecting the public interest, is also supposed to have in mind the welfare of the probationer.\").   Nor is there any allegation or evidence that the Lynn police possessed or exercised any influence, direct or indirect, over the medical-psychiatric decision to issue the pink paper.   Cf. T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 337 n. 5, 105 S.Ct. at 740 n. 5 (\"Nor do we express any opinion on the standards (if any) governing searches of such areas by school officials or by other public authorities acting at the request of school officials.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court nonetheless struck down the City policy because \"the agents of the doctors in this case are police officers with guns and batons, not hospital orderlies and nurses,\" so that \"[t]here is no therapeutic relationship which a warrant mechanism would disrupt.\"  McCabe, 875 F.Supp. at 61.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Whether an administrative search procedure leaves too much discretion to law enforcement officers in the field is a recurring Fourth Amendment concern.   See, e.g., Camara, 387 U.S. at 532-33, 87 S.Ct. at 1733 (\"The practical effect of this system is to leave the occupant subject to the discretion of the official in the field.   This is precisely the discretion to invade private property which we have consistently circumscribed by a requirement that a disinterested party warrant the need to search.\").   Under Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), however, the decision to conduct a category 2 \"search\" is never left to the executing officers.   Moreover, the mere fact that law enforcement officials serve as the agents who implement the authorizing physician's decision to approve a category 2 search does not necessarily mean that the procedure is not within the \"special need\" category:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>[W]e fail to see any constitutional significance in the fact that police officers, rather than \"administrative\" agents, are permitted to conduct the &#167; 415-a5 inspection.   The significance respondent alleges lies in the role of police officers as enforcers of the penal laws and in the officers' power to arrest for offenses other than violations of the administrative scheme.   It is, however, important to note that state police officers, like those in New York, have numerous duties in addition to those associated with traditional police work....  As a practical matter, many States do not have the resources to assign the enforcement of a particular administrative scheme to a specialized agency.   So long as a regulatory scheme is properly administrative, it is not rendered illegal by the fact that the inspecting officer has the power to arrest individuals for violations other than those created by the scheme itself.   In sum, we decline to impose upon the States the burden of requiring the enforcement of their regulatory statutes to be carried out by specialized agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burger, 482 U.S. at 717-18, 107 S.Ct. at 2651;  Cardona, 903 F.2d at 65 (\"The [Griffin ] Court did not lend any special salience to the identity of the person(s) executing the search\";  \"[w]hether the decision, once reached [by the probation officer], is realized through police officers, parole officers, or a tag team representing both camps, is peripheral to the Court's holding.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that these considerations, on balance, favor a limited \"special need\" exception to the warrant requirement in the particular setting presented in this case.   Accordingly, we hold that the Fourth Amendment is not infringed by the challenged City policy, which authorizes warrantless entries of residences by the police for the sole purpose of executing a properly issued category 2 pink paper within a reasonable time after its issuance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We retrace the bounds of our ruling.   We do not suggest that the factors we have discussed, see Section II.D, alone or in combination invariably provide adequate support for a \"special need\" exception to the warrant requirement.   The balancing test for determining whether an administrative procedure comes within the \"special need\" exception is designedly fact-specific, and must be calibrated anew in assessing the reasonableness of each administrative search procedure to which it is applied.   Nor, of course, do we suggest that all comparable state involuntary commitment statutes, or any other provision of Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, or other categories of searches authorized under chapter 123, section 12(a), necessarily satisfy the Fourth Amendment.   See, e.g., Wyman, 400 U.S. at 326, 91 S.Ct. at 390 (\"Our holding today does not mean ... that a termination of benefits upon refusal of a home visit is to be upheld against constitutional challenge under all conceivable circumstances.   The early morning mass raid upon homes of welfare recipients is not unknown.\").   We hold only that law enforcement officers in possession of a pink paper, duly issued pursuant to category 2, Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), may effect a warrantless entry of the subject's residence within a reasonable time after the pink paper issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the challenged City policy comports with the \"special need\" exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, the City is entitled to summary judgment.   We intimate no viewpoint concerning any other aspect of these proceedings, including the McCabe claims against the individual police officers, the constable, and the ambulance crew, which claims were dismissed, without prejudice.

See Cardona, 903 F.2d at 64 (rejecting similar attempt to draw \"entirely artificial distinction[s] between 'search' jurisprudence and 'seizure' jurisprudence\").   And since the cases cited by the City overwhelmingly hold that warrantless, involuntary commitment seizures generally comport with the strictures of the Fourth Amendment, see Villanova, 972 F.2d at 795 (\"There is no requirement of a warrant issued by a judicial officer [to seize the person subject to a commitment order].\"), thus constituting a valid pink paper the practical equivalent of an arrest warrant, see supra note 5;  cf. Welsh, 466 U.S. at 748-49, 104 S.Ct. at 2096-97;  Payton, 445 U.S. at 586, 100 S.Ct. at 1380;  Hegarty, 53 F.3d at 1373, a separate requirement that a search warrant be obtained before entering the residence to seize the subject could be viewed as supererogatory.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Contrary to McCabe's contention, we need not decide whether the City waived the argument that its police officers' actions were not undertaken pursuant to City policy, and that it is therefore not liable under Monell, 436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. at 2037-38.   The City merely argues that the actual police conduct in effecting a warrantless entry often provides the best circumstantial evidence as to the nature of the challenged municipal policy.   See Bordanaro, 871 F.2d at 1156-57 (observing that the event itself is evidence that police officers acted in accordance with municipal policy)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Thus, a \"mental illness\" determination alone is insufficient to support an involuntary commitment order;  the State must also show that the person subjected to involuntary commitment is \"dangerous.\"   See O'Connor v.

In all events, however, we do not think the several hours that elapsed between the issuance and execution of this pink paper, which enabled the constable and police to coordinate their actions, can be considered so inordinate as to call into question the emergent nature of Ms. Zinger's mental-health-related dangerousness.   Whereas delay might belie \"exigent circumstances,\" were that the warrant exception primarily relied upon by the City, no such rigid time constraints can be imposed in a particular \"special need\" case as a precondition to the validity of the systemic search procedure itself.   Nonetheless, we express no opinion as to whether, in another case, inordinate delay in issuing and executing a pink paper might tend to undermine a predicate finding that the subject posed a real \"likelihood of serious harm\" at the time the finding was made</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> It is largely irrelevant whether the \"likelihood of serious harm\" criterion in Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), approximates the \"probable cause\" inquiry appropriate in the search warrant context.   The \"probable cause\" inquiry often is jettisoned in civil administrative searches:</p>\n        <p>\"[W]here a careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause, we have not hesitated to adopt such a standard.\"   We have concluded, for example, that the appropriate standard for administrative searches is not probable cause in its traditional meaning.   Instead, an administrative warrant can be obtained if there is a showing that reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an inspection are satisfied.</p>\n        <p>O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 722-23, 107 S.Ct. at 1500 (citations omitted);  see also T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 340-41, 105 S.Ct. at 742 (\" '[P]robable cause' is not an irreducible requirement of a valid search.   The fundamental command of the Fourth Amendment is that searches and seizures be reasonable, and although 'both the concept of probable cause and the requirement of a warrant bear on the reasonableness of a search, ... in certain limited circumstances neither is required.' \")  (citations omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The other statutory safeguards would not forestall improper warrantless entries of a subject's residence.   See Cardona, 903 F.2d at 66 (\"While the actual invasion of privacy does not occur until the search or seizure occurs, the constitutional protection is viable only to the extent that it restricts the authority responsible for making the search or seizure decision, prior to the time the decision crystallizes.\").   Nonetheless, the other safeguards do mitigate any resulting injury to the subject.   For example, in order to detain a dangerous mentally ill person for more than ten days, the State must petition the district court, and prove beyond reasonable doubt that the patient poses a \"likelihood of serious harm.\"   See Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 123, &#167;&#167; 7, 8 (requiring ongoing, periodic judicial review of commitment decision), 12(d);  Commonwealth v. Nassar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2029577\"><a href=\"/opinion/2029577/commonwealth-v-nassar/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2029577\"><a href=\"/opinion/2029577/commonwealth-v-nassar/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1286</span></a></span>, 1290-91 (1980)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Although there is no evidence that Dr. Barden had been Ms. Zinger's regular physician, the challenged City policy is to be evaluated in light of its systemic traits and purposes.   Cf. Cardona, 903 F.2d at 67;  supra pp. 550-51.   No doubt many, if not most, category 2 searches are executed pursuant to pink papers issued by the subject-patient's current or former psychiatric physician.   Unlike law enforcement officers, who rarely interact with a search target on more than one occasion, as a rule physicians possess reliable personal knowledge of their patients, based on an ongoing doctor-patient relationship.   Cf. Griffin, 483 U.S. at 879, 107 S.Ct. at 3172 (\"As was true, then, in [O'Connor ] ... and [T.L.O.], we deal with a situation in which there is an ongoing supervisory relationship--and one that is not, or at least not entirely, adversarial--between the object of the search and the decision-maker.\")</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
