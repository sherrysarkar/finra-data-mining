Plaintiff-appellant  alleged  age\r                                 \r\n\ndiscrimination  in  the  termination  of   his  eighteen-year\r\n\nemployment as a quality  assurance engineer during a company-\r\n\nwide  reduction in  force  which occurred  shortly after  his\r\n\nformer employer was acquired by another corporation.  The new\r\n\nemployer,   LIRIS,  responded   that   the  elimination   and\r\n\nconsolidation  of employee  positions was  a necessary  cost-\r\n\ncutting  move, and that it  had treated age  neutrally in the\r\n\nprocess.  After lengthy discovery, the district court granted\r\n\nsummary judgment to LIRIS because plaintiff's proof failed to\r\n\ncreate a genuine issue of fact as to LIRIS's motivation. \r\n\n          Reviewing the  judgment de novo, and  after a close\r                                                     \r\n\nexamination of the record and briefs, we find no  substantial\r\n\nreason  to disagree  with  the  district court's  conclusion.\r\n\nAccordingly, we summarily  affirm the  judgment, adding  only\r\n\nthe  following comments  in  response to  two of  appellant's\r\n\narguments on appeal.\r\n\n          (1)  We have  reviewed with care the excerpts  from\r\n\nappellant's  deposition  testimony   which  he  claims   were\r\n\noverlooked  by the district court.    The  testimony does not\r                                                                         \r\n\nidentify the  anonymous declarant(s) who reported  that LIRIS\r\n\nwas prejudiced against older workers and \"taking a hard  look\r\n\nat  anyone  over  40 years  of  age  and  earning over  40K.\"\r\n\nAppellant named  employees who \"discussed,\"  \"referenced,\" or\r\n\n\"mentioned\" the anonymous statements, not those who initially\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nuttered them.       Appellant's reliance on Conway v. Electro\r                                                                         \r\n\nSwitch  Corp., 825 F.2d 593  (1st Cir. 1987),  and Woodman v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nHaemonetics  Corp., 51  F.3d  1087 (1st  Cir.  1995) is  thus\r                              \r\n\nmisplaced.   In Conway, we  held that the  district court did\r                                  \r\n\nnot abuse its  discretion in a gender  discrimination case by\r\n\nadmitting  into  evidence   testimony  reflecting  two  prior\r\n\ninstances of gender bias in the treatment of women employees.\r\n\nThe witnesses testified that in each instance a named company\r\n\nmanager  explained a  decision to  deny a  pay increase  to a\r\n\nwoman employee on the basis of the woman's gender.  The named\r\n\ndeclarants had authority  to make the statements, and  one of\r\n\nthem  was the  president  of the  company  at the  time  that\r\n\nplaintiff's employment  was terminated.   We held  that under\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 401, the  statements were not wholly irrelevant\r\n\nto  the issues  at hand  because they  might circumstantially\r\n\nevidence  a  \"corporate state-of-mind\"  or  a \"discriminatory\r\n\natmosphere.\"  \r\n\n          In Woodman,  an age  discrimination  case, we  held\r                                \r\n\nadmissible  a  named  supervisor's  statement  purporting  to\r\n\ncommunicate management's desire for a younger workforce.  The\r\n\nsupervisor  was  in  a   position  to  know  of  management's\r\n\nintentions; she was  \"directly involved\" in implementing  the\r\n\nchallenged   reduction  in  force;   and  the  statement  was\r\n\nadmissible  under  Fed.  R.  Evid.  801(d)(2)(D)  because  it\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nconcerned  matters  within  the  scope   of  her  employment.\r\n\nWoodman, 51 F.3d at 1093-94.  \r                   \r\n\n          In  contrast, appellant's  proof is  that anonymous\r\n\nstatements  reporting a  discriminatory animus  were \"abound\"\r\n\nduring the  layoff period,  and \"bantered about\"  by numerous\r\n\nemployees.   There was no evidence that the banterers were in\r\n\na  position to know of  management's sentiments nor that they\r\n\nhad  any  responsibility  for  communicating  or implementing\r\n\nLIRIS's policy.  The  identification of one of the  banterers\r\n\nas a \"supervisor\"  does not alone  provide the missing  link,\r\n\nespecially  since this supervisor was himself a victim of the\r\n\nnew management's layoff. \r\n\n          Proof of \"bantering\" by  employees fearful of a new\r\n\nemployer's motives for a layoff does not suffice to establish\r\n\na  genuine issue of fact as to the employer's actual mindset.\r\n\nCf.  Betkerur v. Aultman Hosp. Ass'n, 78 F.3d 1079, 1095 (6th\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1996) (holding that \"rumors, conclusory allegations  and\r\n\nsubjective  beliefs  [are]  wholly insufficient  evidence  to\r\n\nestablish a claim of discrimination as a matter of law\").  As\r\n\nthe district  court observed, too, appellant's  proof did not\r\n\nsatisfy the  foundation requirements for  admissibility under\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(C)(D).\r\n\n          (2)  Appellant's evidence also was  insufficient to\r\n\nestablish  a genuine issue of  fact in support  of his theory\r\n\nthat  he was \"replaced\" in his position by a younger employee\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nand/or that  LIRIS retained  younger employees in  the \"same\"\r\n\nposition.  Viewing  the evidence in the light  most favorable\r\n\nto  appellant, it  could not  support a  reasonable inference\r\n\nthat  any employee  assumed a  position that  was coextensive\r\n\nwith,  or  identical  to,  the  duties  which  appellant  had\r\n\nperformed.   See LeBlanc v.  Great American Ins.  Co., 6 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n836, 846  (1st Cir. 1993) (an employee is not \"replaced\" when\r\n\nanother is  assigned  to perform  his duties  in addition  to\r\n\nother duties, or when  the work is redistributed among  other\r\n\nexisting  employees already  performing related  work), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied,  114 S.Ct. 1398  (1994); cf. Hebert  v. Mohawk Rubber\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo., 872 F.2d 1104, 1114  (1st Cir. 1989) (finding sufficient\r               \r\n\nproof to survive summary  judgment where the younger retained\r\n\nperson \"exactly\" conducted the  work of riffed employee, with\r\n\nonly minor modifications). \r\n\n          Appellant's motion for reconsideration of the order\r\n\nsubmitting this  case for  decision without oral  argument is\r\n\ndenied.  The judgment is affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.  \r                                                   \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714823\"><a href=\"/opinion/714823/mangala-v-betkerur-md-canton-neonatology-inc-v-aultman-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span>, 1095 (6th Cir.1996) (holding that \"rumors, conclusory allegations and subjective beliefs [are] wholly insufficient evidence to establish a claim of discrimination as a matter of law\").  As the district court observed, too, appellant's proof did not satisfy the foundation requirements for admissibility under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(C)(D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Appellant's evidence also was insufficient to establish a genuine issue of fact in support of his theory that he was \"replaced\" in his position by a younger employee and/or that LIRIS retained younger employees in the \"same\" position.  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellant, it could not support a reasonable inference that any employee assumed a position that was coextensive with, or identical to, the duties which appellant had performed.   See LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654585\"><a href=\"/opinion/654585/theodore-l-leblanc-v-great-american-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 846 (1st Cir.1993) (an employee is not \"replaced\" when another is assigned to perform his duties in addition to other duties, or when the work is redistributed among other existing employees already performing related work), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1398</span></span> (1994);   cf.  Hebert v.
