This petition for review is frivolous. \r\nPetitioner raises no cognizable challenge to the order of the\r\nBoard of Immigration Appeals finding his appeal untimely. \r\nInstead, petitioner attempts to raise claims not addressed in\r\nthat order.  We have no jurisdiction to consider those claims.\r\n    The order is affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.  The\r\nstay of deportation granted by this court now is lifted.\n",
