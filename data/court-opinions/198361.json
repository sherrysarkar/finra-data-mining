Appellant, George Wayne Reeder,\r\nwas charged with five counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18\r\nU.S.C.  1343, and five counts of interstate transportation of\r\nstolen property, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  2314.  The charges are\r\nbased on five wire transfers made in June 1988.  The transfers were\r\nto pay liens and costs on properties owned by Reeder which had been\r\nposted as collateral for the purchase of two insurance companies. \r\nReeder's first trial in May 1996 resulted in a hung jury. \r\nFollowing a retrial in October 1996, Reeder was convicted of all\r\nten counts.  The district court sentenced Reeder to forty-six\r\nmonths in prison and ordered him to pay restitution in the amount\r\nof $16.5 million.  In all respects, we affirm.\r\n                  BACKGROUND\r\nWe review the facts of a criminal case on appeal from a\r\nconviction in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See United\r\nStates v. Gonzlez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1997).  Our\r\npresentation of the facts draws considerably on our recent opinion\r\nin United States v. Christopher, 142 F.3d 46 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nIn mid-1987, Charles Christopher and other investors\r\nformed a holding company called Resolute Holdings, Inc.\r\n(\"Resolute\") for the purpose of acquiring insurance companies. \r\nResolute sought to acquire American Universal Insurance Company\r\n(\"American\"), an insurer headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island,\r\nand Diamond Benefits Life Insurance Company (\"Diamond\"), an insurer\r\nthat was licensed in Arizona and had its principal offices in\r\nCalifornia.  Resolute, however, was a shell company, with no assets\r\nexcept $250,000 in working capital.  In late 1987, Christopher and\r\nResolute enlisted the participation of Reeder, a California\r\ndeveloper who had real estate holdings and controlled several\r\ncompanies, including Hill Top Developers (\"Hill Top\").  Reeder\r\nagreed to contribute capital to the insurance companies in exchange\r\nfor a share in Resolute.\r\nIn early February 1988, Reeder negotiated a deal with\r\nResolute.  Under the terms of Reeder's deal with Resolute, in\r\nexchange for Reeder's capital contribution to the insurance\r\ncompanies, Reeder received a 60% share of Resolute and about $2\r\nmillion in yearly profit participation.  Reeder thus acquired a\r\ncontrolling interest in Resolute, although the formal transfer of\r\nResolute shares to Reeder did not become official until June 1988.\r\nIn addition to reaching an agreement with the respective\r\nsellers of American and Diamond, Resolute had to obtain the\r\napproval of state insurance regulatory authorities.  By statute,\r\nthe Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation (\"RIDBR\") had to\r\napprove the sale of American, and the Departments of Insurance in\r\nboth Arizona and California had to approve the sale of Diamond. \r\nResolute submitted an application, known as a Form A statement, to\r\neach of those three states.  Each Form A required the disclosure of\r\nextensive background and financial information about the\r\nindividuals involved in the acquisition, their business plan for\r\nthe company, and the financial means by which the company would be\r\nacquired, so that the regulators could assess whether the\r\nacquisition would jeopardize the interests of policyholders.\r\nAs part of its acquisition plan submitted to the\r\ninsurance regulators, Resolute agreed to capitalize the insurance\r\ncompanies by contributing Reeder's $50 million promissory note,\r\nsecured by Heritage Ranch and Indian Palms, to American.  To\r\ncapitalize Diamond, Resolute agreed to contribute Reeder's $12\r\nmillion promissory note, secured by Indian Springs.\r\nThe acquisition of Diamond had an additional component. \r\nResolute had negotiated for Diamond to assume a block of annuity\r\npolicies from the Life Assurance Company of Pennsylvania (\"LACOP\"). \r\nAs consideration for its assumption of about $31 million in LACOP's\r\nannuity obligations, Diamond was to receive about $29.4 million in\r\ncash from LACOP.  Of that sum, $18 million was to be delivered to\r\nDiamond at closing, with the remainder to follow several months\r\nlater.\r\nAt the time of Resolute's Form A applications, all of the\r\nReeder properties securing Reeder's promissory notes -- Heritage\r\nRanch, Indian Palms, and Indian Springs -- had extensive liens on\r\nthem.  On Heritage Ranch and Indian Palms alone, the total was\r\nabout $17 million.  Those preexisting liens were significant\r\nbecause they meant that American's and Diamond's security interests\r\nwould be subordinated to other mortgages on the properties.  In\r\naddition, pre-existing liens on the collateral decreased the value\r\nof the promissory notes, thereby decreasing the amount of capital\r\nwith which the insurance companies could do business.\r\nIn February 1988, Reeder made a deal with Christopher\r\nthat Resolute would purchase Reeder's liens from the banks so that\r\nthe closings could go forward.  Reeder and Resolute made repeated\r\nrepresentations to the insurance regulators that the pre-existing\r\nliens on the Reeder properties would be cleared by closing.  At the\r\nsame time that these representations were being made, however,\r\nReeder was repeatedly advised that Resolute had no means by which\r\nto pay the debt.\r\nIn the Form A filings submitted to Rhode Island, Arizona,\r\nand California, Resolute represented that all pre-existing liens on\r\nthe collateral securing its promissory notes to the insurance\r\ncompanies would be discharged at or before closing on Resolute's\r\nacquisition.\r\nOn March 10, 1988, Arizona approved Resolute's\r\nacquisition of Diamond.  Resolute understood that, by Diamond's\r\nclosing, it still had to provide documentation demonstrating that\r\nthe pre-existing liens on the property securing the notes to\r\nDiamond had been cleared.\r\nThe Rhode Island regulators were particularly concerned\r\nabout the encumbrances on the property securing the promissory note\r\nto American.  In late April, RIDBR chief legal counsel Nancy Mayer\r\nwrote to Resolute asking whether Reeder's corporations owned\r\nHeritage Ranch and Indian Palms \"free and clear of all\r\nencumbrances.\"\r\nReeder later admitted that he knew that the liens would\r\nnot be paid off by the closings on the insurance companies, despite\r\nthe representations to the regulators.  Nevertheless, Reeder was\r\nstill actively involved in the acquisition of the insurance\r\ncompanies.  On May 24, Reeder had a meeting with Christopher and\r\nseveral other Resolute principals to decide who was going to run\r\nthe insurance companies.  Reeder, soon to be the majority\r\nshareholder of Resolute, had the ultimate authority to make that\r\ndecision.  Against the strong opposition of the other Resolute\r\nprincipals, Reeder placed Christopher in charge of the insurance\r\ncompanies.\r\nThe RIDBR scheduled an approval hearing on the American\r\nacquisition for May 26.  On May 24, just two days prior to that\r\nhearing -- when Reeder knew that the American closing was imminent\r\n-- Reeder signed a number of documents relating to the purchase of\r\nAmerican, including a capitalization agreement that was submitted\r\nto the RIDBR as part of the Form A application.  In the\r\ncapitalization agreement, Reeder represented that, \"[t]here are no\r\nactions, suits or proceedings, pending or threatened, to the\r\ncurrent actual knowledge of the Makers, effecting [sic] the $50\r\nMillion Note or any portion of the property, at law or in equity or\r\nbefore or by any federal, state, municipal or other governmental\r\ndepartment, commission, [or] board.\"  This statement was not true. \r\nReeder knew that suits were threatened against both Heritage Ranch\r\nand Indian Palms, the two properties securing the $50 million\r\npromissory note to American.\r\nAt the time Reeder signed the capitalization agreement,\r\nReeder had a $10 million note outstanding with Continental Bank,\r\nsecured by Heritage Ranch.  Reeder had missed a $2.3 million\r\namortization payment due in October 1987.  In a meeting with\r\nContinental in December 1987, Reeder told the bank that he did not\r\nhave the cash to meet his obligations under the loan.  On March 11,\r\n1988, Continental notified Reeder that he was in default and that\r\nthe bank might institute foreclosure proceedings.  On April 29,\r\nContinental demanded full payment on the loan, and on June 3, 1988,\r\nContinental filed for foreclosure on Heritage Ranch.\r\nReeder was also delinquent on several loans he had\r\noutstanding with Home Federal Bank (\"Home Fed\").  Reeder owed Home\r\nFed more than $7 million for loans that were secured by both\r\nHeritage Ranch and Indian Palms, and he had not made payments on\r\ncertain loans since June 1987.  On May 12, Home Fed demanded\r\npayment in full on one of the loans secured by Heritage Ranch.\r\nOn May 26, 1988, Rhode Island held the approval hearing\r\non the proposed acquisition of American by Resolute.  Resolute\r\nmaintained its position that it would pay off the pre-existing\r\nliens on the Reeder properties securing the promissory note by\r\nclosing.  Indeed, at some point that day, although not at the\r\nformal hearing, RIDBR Chief Counsel Mayer was told that the pre-\r\nexisting liens on the Reeder properties had been cleared.\r\nOn May 27, 1988, the RIDBR issued a conditional order\r\napproving Resolute's acquisition of American.  Although the\r\ntransaction closed that day, the order made clear that the transfer\r\nof ownership would not become final until Resolute submitted final\r\ntitle insurance policies for Heritage Ranch and Indian Palms \"to be\r\neffective as of the closing date which indicat[e]\" that \"all\r\nmortgages, deeds of trust and the like have been paid in full and\r\ndischarged.\"  On June 7, 1988, California issued an order approving\r\nResolute's acquisition of Diamond, which Arizona had already\r\napproved on March 10.  The extensive liens on Heritage Ranch,\r\nIndian Palms, and Indian Springs were not paid off by May 27, when\r\nthe American purchase closed, nor by June 14, when the Diamond\r\npurchase closed.\r\nOn May 28, 1988, Christopher told Reeder that the\r\nregulators had approved the American acquisition.  A few days\r\nlater, Reeder and Christopher had a private meeting to discuss the\r\nacquisitions at Reeder's office in California.  Christopher\r\nconfirmed that the liens on Reeder's properties had not yet been\r\ndischarged.  Reeder became angry when Christopher informed him that\r\nthe Rhode Island regulators had amended the release clause\r\nprovision of Reeder's promissory note to American.\r\nThe release clause governed the rate at which Reeder had\r\nto pay down the balance on the $50 million promissory note to\r\nAmerican if he sold portions of the properties securing the note. \r\nUnder the original provision, Reeder was required to pay American\r\nonly 110% of the appraised value of each lot sold, even though the\r\nlots could be sold for a price considerably higher than the\r\nappraised value.  Under the amended release clause, all monies\r\nreceived from the sales of portions of the properties securing the\r\nnote had to be applied to reducing the principal balance of the\r\nnote.  Reeder could not receive any monies from the sale of the\r\nlots until the $50 million note had been paid off in its entirety. \r\nNor could Reeder take money from the insurance companies for\r\ndevelopment costs associated with Heritage Ranch or Indian Palms. \r\nReeder found the amended release clause to be \"untenable,\" because\r\nit deprived him of the steady cash flow he had expected from the\r\nsale of lots at Heritage Ranch and Indian Palms.\r\nReeder arranged with Christopher, in an oral agreement\r\nwith no documentation, for an $18 million \"loan\" to Hill Top.  The\r\n\"loan\" was to be secured by Windbrook Country Club, yet another of\r\nReeder's properties, which was worth only $3 million.  Although\r\nReeder later said that, he expected that Resolute would be the\r\nentity loaning Hill Top funds under the Windbrook \"loan,\" Reeder\r\nknew that Resolute had no assets except the insurance companies. \r\nReeder also knew that, upon Resolute's acquisition of Diamond,\r\nDiamond was to receive the  LACOP annuity money, the first\r\ninstallment of which was in the amount of $18 million -- the same\r\namount as the Windbrook loan.\r\nOn June 13, Reeder signed the documents for the Windbrook\r\nloan.  Under the terms of the Windbrook loan, Diamond -- not\r\nResolute -- agreed to lend Hill Top up to $18 million to pay off\r\nliens on Heritage Ranch, Indian Palms, and Windbrook Country Club. \r\nThe documents were dated June 15, 1988 -- the day after the\r\nexpected Diamond closing.\r\nThe Windbrook loan violated state regulatory\r\nrequirements.  Under Arizona insurance regulations, Diamond could\r\nnot advance loan proceeds in an amount greater than the value of\r\nthe collateral backing the loan.  In addition, it could not invest\r\nmore than 10% of its assets in a single investment.   No waiver was\r\nrequested or received for the $18 million Windbrook loan.  In\r\naddition, the insurance regulators required that the money to pay\r\noff the liens come from an external source.\r\nAfter Reeder's private meeting with Christopher about the\r\nWindbrook loan, Reeder began settlement negotiations with\r\nContinental and Home Fed over his outstanding loan obligations.  On\r\nJune 7, Reeder reached a settlement with Continental for a\r\n\"discounted note payoff\" in which Reeder agreed to pay off his $10\r\nmillion note to Continental for about $8.7 million.  Reeder\r\narranged for the payment to be due on June 16 -- two days after the\r\nanticipated Diamond closing.\r\nOn June 10, Resolute shareholders met in Dallas, Texas\r\nfor their first meeting.  One of Reeder's attorneys, Arthur Karma\r\nattended the meeting as a proxy for Reeder, the controlling\r\nshareholder.  Pursuant to Reeder's instructions, Karma voted to\r\nmake Christopher a director of both insurance companies, as well as\r\nthe new President of American and the CEO of Diamond.  In addition,\r\nReeder had twice instructed Karma to make certain that Christopher\r\npaid off the Continental loan, which Reeder had settled a few days\r\nearlier.  Karma related Reeder's message to Christopher, and\r\nChristopher said the liens would be paid in the next few days.\r\nUnbeknownst to Colleen Comey, the President of Diamond,\r\non June 13, the day before the closing on Diamond, Christopher\r\ndirected Keith Bell, an employee of American, to open an account in\r\nDiamond's name at Fleet Bank in Providence, Rhode Island.  On\r\nJune 15, the day after Diamond's closing, Christopher directed Bell\r\nto have LACOP transfer the first installment of $18 million owed to\r\nDiamond to the Fleet Bank account.\r\nOnce the $18 million was deposited in the Fleet Bank\r\naccount, Christopher directed Bell to make a series of wire\r\ndisbursements.  Five of those transfers were pursuant to Reeder's\r\ndirections and for Reeder's benefit.\r\nOn June 16, Reeder caused $8.7 million to be sent from\r\nthe Diamond account to Continental Bank in Chicago, per the\r\nsettlement he had reached with the bank on June 7.  This payment\r\nextinguished the most substantial pre-existing lien on Heritage\r\nRanch.\r\nAlso on June 16, 1988, Reeder caused $465,000 to be\r\ntransferred to an account of the Burrillville Land Company in Santa\r\nMonica, California.  Reeder had no interest in that company or its\r\naccounts.  Burrillville, however, was managed by Carlsberg\r\nManagement, which was closely associated with Reeder's businesses. \r\nThen, on June 17, through written instructions, Reeder had the\r\naccount manager, Theresa DeLeon, allocate the $465,000 into three\r\nseparate checks for $100,000, $315,000, and $50,000, all payable to\r\nHill Top.\r\nOn June 23, 1988, Reeder caused $825,000 to be\r\ntransferred to the client trust account of James Patison, the\r\nlawyer who had negotiated the Home Fed settlement for Reeder. \r\nReeder stated that this $825,000 transfer, which he discussed with\r\nChristopher at their private meeting in early June, involved\r\npayments to Reeder of funds he felt he was owed by Home Fed in\r\nconnection with two joint ventures Home Fed and Reeder had engaged\r\nin:  Whimpy Gentry and Rancho 187.  Reeder's settlement agreement\r\nwith Home Fed, however, stated that it resolved all disputes\r\nbetween the parties, including those two matters.  Reeder admitted\r\nthat the insurance companies were wholly unrelated to those two\r\nprojects.  Reeder also admitted that the $825,000 transfer\r\nrepresented a portion of the discount he was able to negotiate in\r\nhis settlement with Home Fed.\r\nOn June 23, 1988, Reeder caused $459,000 to be\r\ntransferred to Carlsberg Management.  As with the earlier transfer\r\nto Burrillville, Reeder gave DeLeon written instructions on how to\r\ndisburse the funds.  The same day the funds were received, DeLeon\r\ncut two checks: one for $384,000 payable to Hill Top, and one for\r\n$75,000 payable to a Reeder intercorporate account.  Reeder stated\r\nthat this wire transfer, as well as the prior June 16 transfer of\r\n$465,000, represented the approximately $1 million discount he had\r\nnegotiated on his outstanding debt with Continental Bank.  Reeder\r\nalso admitted that he had made an agreement with Christopher at\r\ntheir early June meeting to take these amounts, as compensation for\r\nthe amended release clause, for development costs at Heritage  \r\nRanch -- a use that was prohibited by the regulators.\r\nReeder had signed the settlement agreement with Home Fed\r\non June 22, which required him to pay Home Fed approximately $5.9\r\nmillion.  The Diamond account at Fleet Bank, however, had been\r\nnearly exhausted by this time and did not have sufficient funds to\r\ncover that amount.  Therefore, $3 million was transferred to\r\nDiamond's Fleet account from an American account without any\r\njustification or supporting documentation.\r\nThen, on June 24, 1988, Reeder caused approximately $5.9\r\nmillion to be transferred from the Fleet account to Home Fed in\r\npayment of Reeder's obligations to that bank.\r\nThe total amount taken from the insurance companies for\r\nReeder's benefit was approximately $16.5 million, consisting of\r\n$13.5 million taken from Diamond and $3 million taken from\r\nAmerican.\r\nBy August 1988, Colleen Comey, Diamond's President, had\r\nbecome concerned about the whereabouts of the LACOP money.  At that\r\npoint, as annuity holders attempted to cash in their policies,\r\nDiamond was writing checks that were returned for insufficient\r\nfunds.  When Comey began inquiring whether the LACOP money had been\r\nreceived, she learned that it was gone.  In trying to determine how\r\nthe money had been spent, she was unable to reconstruct the\r\ntransactions.  Finally, after failing to receive an adequate\r\nexplanation from Christopher, Comey called Reeder to report her\r\nconcerns about the missing $18 million and make further inquiries. \r\nReeder expressed no surprise at all when Comey informed him of the\r\nmissing $18 million, but he gave her no information about the\r\nmissing money, simply telling her to speak to Christopher or\r\nWilliam Geary, another Resolute principal.  On September 22, 1988,\r\nconcerned that the second installment of $10 million soon due from\r\nLACOP would likewise disappear, Comey froze the Fleet account and\r\nalerted regulators. The next day she was fired.\r\n                  DISCUSSION\r\nI.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nWhen a defendant challenges his criminal conviction,\r\nclaiming that the government failed to present sufficient evidence\r\nto prove the defendant guilty of the charged crime, the court must\r\n\"view the evidence, together with all reasonable inferences that\r\nmay be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the\r\ngovernment,\" United States v. Campa, 679 F.2d 1006, 1010 (1st Cir.\r\n1982), and while so doing, must ask whether \"a rational trier of\r\nfacts could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" United\r\nStates v. Ingraham, 832 F.2d 229, 239 (1st Cir. 1987), cert.\r\ndenied, 486 U.S. 1009 (1988).  The court must apply this standard\r\nboth to direct and to circumstantial evidence;  \"[c]ircumstantial\r\nevidence is intrinsically no different from testimonial evidence,\r\nand is entitled to similar weight.\"  United States v. Van Helden,\r\n920 F.2d 99, 101 (1st Cir. 1990) (citations omitted).  Thus, the\r\ngovernment may use circumstantial evidence to prove its case. \r\nHowever, the total evidence, with all reasonable inferences made in\r\nthe light most favorable to the government, must be such that a\r\nrational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt.  See United States v. Mena, 933 F.2d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 1991). \r\nFurthermore, the government need not present evidence that\r\nprecludes every reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt in\r\norder to sustain a conviction. See United States v.\r\nGuerrero-Guerrero, 776 F.2d 1071, 1075 (1st Cir. 1985), cert.\r\ndenied, 475 U.S. 1029 (1986).  Rather, the jury is at liberty to\r\nselect freely among a variety of reasonable alternative\r\nconstructions of the evidence.  See United States v. Smith, 680\r\nF.2d 255, 259 (1st Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1110 (1983).\r\nA.  Wire Fraud\r\nReeder argues that his wire fraud convictions cannot\r\nstand because there is no evidence in the record that he knew that\r\nChristopher's assurances concerning the liens were false, much less\r\nthat he shared Christopher's intent to deceive and defraud the\r\nregulators.  See Defendant's Br. at 21.  We find his argument\r\nunpersuasive.\r\nTo prove wire fraud, the government must establish beyond\r\na reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant's knowing and willing\r\nparticipation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with the specific\r\nintent to defraud; and (2) the use of interstate wire\r\ncommunications in furtherance of the scheme.  See United States v.\r\nSawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 723 (1st Cir. 1996).  \r\nReeder challenges only the intent element.  He concedes\r\nthat Resolute and Christopher made numerous representations to the\r\nregulators that the liens on Reeder's properties would be paid off\r\nby closing.  He also admits that Christopher made these\r\nmisrepresentations with the intent to deceive as part of a scheme\r\nto defraud the insurance regulators.  Reeder's argument is that the\r\nevidence does not demonstrate that he knew those representations to\r\nbe false because he allegedly believed that Resolute would pay off\r\nthe liens.\r\nAt trial, Reeder testified that he did not expect that\r\nthe liens would be paid off by closing, and that he did not think\r\nthat Resolute would pay off the liens before closing.  Reeder's own\r\ntestimony provided evidence that, despite the repeated\r\nrepresentations made to the insurance regulators that the pre-\r\nexisting liens on his properties would be cleared by closing,\r\nReeder knew that the liens would not be discharged at that time.\r\nFurthermore, Reeder was the de facto majority shareholder\r\nof Resolute.  He admitted that the huge amount of money he was\r\nfronting for the insurance companies was too much to be put at risk\r\nwithout control of Resolute.  Although Reeder did not formally\r\nreceive his shares in Resolute until June 1988, the jury was\r\nentitled to infer that he was the one making decisions for Resolute\r\nbefore that time, as he was on May 24 when he placed Christopher in\r\ncharge of the insurance companies.  The evidence further showed\r\nthat Reeder kept in close and direct contact with Christopher\r\nthroughout the acquisition process, and Jarrell Ormand, Resolute's\r\nlawyer in Texas, communicated with Reeder in responding to\r\ninquiries from the RIDBR.  From this evidence, the jury could infer\r\nthat Reeder was intimately involved with Resolute's effort to\r\nacquire the insurance companies and responsible for the\r\nrepresentations made to the regulators on behalf of Resolute that\r\nthe liens on his properties would be cleared by closing.\r\nThe evidence also demonstrated that Reeder knew that\r\nResolute had no means by which to pay off the liens.  In letters on\r\nMarch 11, May 13, and May 20, Karma and his law partner, David\r\nBence, informed Reeder of their increasing concern over Resolute's\r\nfailure to make any arrangements to discharge the debt.  Reeder,\r\nhowever, ignored their pleas for a meeting, and instead made his\r\nown false representation to the regulators that no suits were\r\nthreatened against the properties backing his promissory note to\r\nAmerican, even though two banks were about to initiate foreclosure\r\nproceedings.  From this sequence of events, the jury could\r\nreasonably infer that Reeder was aware of the fact that the liens\r\non his properties would not be paid off by closing, and that he\r\nintended to deceive the regulators when he and Resolute made the\r\nrepeated representations that his properties would be unencumbered\r\nupon Resolute's acquisition of the insurance companies.  See United\r\nStates v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006, 1024 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"Guilty\r\nknowledge may be inferred where instances of fraud are repeatedly\r\nbrought to a defendant's attention without prompting alteration of\r\nhis facilitative conduct.\") (quotation omitted).\r\nIn support of his assertion that he believed that\r\nResolute would discharge his liens, Reeder relies primarily on\r\nstatements made by him, his corporations, or Christopher and his\r\nagents that Resolute would pay off the liens.  The simple fact that\r\nthose statements were made, however, does not prove that Reeder\r\nbelieved them.  Moreover, the jury was entitled not only to\r\ndisbelieve Reeder's statements, but also \"[to] legitimately . . .\r\npresume[] that the fabrication[s] w[ere] all the more proof of\r\n[his] guilt.\"  United States v. Jimnez-Prez, 869 F.2d 9, 10 (1st.\r\nCir. 1989).\r\nReeder's participation in making misrepresentations to\r\nthe regulators, his use of the wires to divert $16.5 million of the\r\ninsurance companies' funds, and his fraudulent efforts to conceal\r\nhis actions overwhelmingly establish his intentional participation\r\nin the scheme to defraud.  Based on this evidence, a rational trier\r\nof fact could easily have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nB.  Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property (\"ITSP\")\r\nReeder contends that his ITSP convictions must be\r\noverturned because the government failed to prove that he knew that\r\nthe property was taken by fraud.  We disagree.\r\nTo convict on the five ITSP counts, the jury had to find\r\nthat Reeder transported in interstate commerce $5,000 or more that\r\nhe knew to have been stolen, converted, or taken by fraud.  SeeDowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 214 (1985) (stating the\r\nelements of 18 U.S.C.  2314).  Reeder agrees that Christopher\r\nengaged in a scheme to defraud, and, as explained above, the\r\nevidence demonstrates that, after the insurance companies were\r\nacquired, Reeder entered into an agreement with Christopher to\r\ndivert $16.5 million of the insurance companies' funds for his own\r\npurposes and structured the transactions to conceal his activities. \r\nBased on that evidence alone, the jury could reasonably infer that\r\nReeder knew that the money he transported had been taken by fraud.\r\nII.  Government's Closing Argument\r\nReeder argues that his convictions must be reversed\r\nbecause the government's closing argument misled the jury into\r\nfinding guilt based on conduct not amounting to fraud.  At trial,\r\nReeder did not object to any portion of the prosecutor's closing\r\nargument.  Therefore, his claim is reviewed only for plain error. \r\nSee United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 6, 14-15 (1985).\r\nReeder contends that the prosecutor argued that the jury\r\ncould convict Reeder of wire fraud based: (1) on his admission that\r\nhe took $1 million from the insurance companies in response to the\r\namended release clause; (2) on his violation of a state regulation\r\nby failing to secure a waiver from Arizona for the Windbrook loan;\r\nor (3) on his failure to comply with the Windbrook contract terms\r\nby taking money for purposes other than the discharge of liens. \r\nReeder contends that such proof would be insufficient to sustain\r\nhis convictions because it would not constitute \"a fraud in\r\nobtaining the property.\"  Defendant's Br. at 30.\r\nContrary to Reeder's assertions, the government did not\r\nargue to the jury that it could convict Reeder of fraud if it found\r\nsimply that he had taken $1 million from the insurance companies,\r\nviolated a state regulation, or disregarded the loan terms.\r\nWe consider the prosecutor's comments within the\r\nframework and context of the entire case. See United States v.Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d 849, 854 (1st Cir. 1993).  Evidence at\r\ntrial demonstrated that Reeder: (1) admitted that he took $1\r\nmillion from the insurance companies; (2) failed to disclose or\r\nsecure a waiver from the state regulators for the Windbrook \"loan\"\r\ndespite his knowledge that insurance company transactions were\r\nsubject to strict oversight; and (3) took money from the insurance\r\ncompanies for purposes unrelated to the business of the insurance\r\ncompanies and not covered by the terms of the Windbrook \"loan.\"\r\nIn his closing argument, the prosecutor argued that this\r\nevidence, in the context of and in combination with other evidence,\r\ndemonstrated Reeder's knowing participation in the fraudulent\r\ndiversion of insurance company assets and his intent to defraud. \r\nSee, e.g., United States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 62 (1st Cir.\r\n1998) (violation of state law probative of intent to deceive in\r\nmail fraud case); see id. at 57 (\"The jury was entitled to infer\r\n[defendant's] intent from the circumstances surrounding his\r\nactions, from indirect, as opposed to direct, evidence.\")\r\n(quotation omitted); see also United States v. Tajeddini, 996 F.2d\r\n1278, 1282 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"[T]he prosecutor is entitled, in\r\nclosing, to ask the jury to draw warrantable inferences from the\r\nevidence admitted during trial.\").\r\nThere is no reason to believe that the jury erroneously\r\nconcluded that it could convict simply because Reeder violated a\r\nregulatory order or breached a contract.  Defense counsel\r\nrepeatedly warned the jury that Reeder was \"not on trial for\r\nviolating a conditional order\" or \"for violation of a state\r\nstatute.\"  They further informed the jury that \"[t]his is not a\r\nbreach of contract case,\" and that the jury had to decide whether\r\nReeder \"knowingly and willfully obtain[ed] the money through deceit\r\nor fraud.\"  Furthermore, the trial court's instructions cured any\r\nalleged error in the closing argument.  The court correctly\r\ninstructed the jury on the elements of the offense for both the\r\nwire fraud and the ITSP counts.  The court specifically instructed\r\nthe jury that \"[t]he violation of an insurance regulatory order or\r\nstate law is not itself a federal crime.\"\r\nIII.  Variance\r\nReeder argues that the alleged theories of conviction\r\noffered by the prosecution in its closing argument varied from the\r\ntheory of conviction alleged in the indictment.  Specifically, he\r\ncontends that the government urged the jury to convict on what he\r\nterms \"non-fraud\" theories: (1) the admission that Reeder took $1\r\nmillion; (2) the failure to get a waiver for the Windbrook loan;\r\nand (3) the failure to comply with the contract terms.  He urges\r\nthis Court to reverse because these \"non-fraud\" theories of\r\nconviction varied from the theory of fraud charged in the\r\nindictment.  Reeder argues that his rights were substantially\r\naffected by the alleged variance because the jury was allowed to\r\nconvict on a theory insufficient to constitute the federal crime of\r\nwire fraud.  Reeder's variance argument is simply a restatement of\r\nhis claim that the jury may have convicted him on a legally\r\ninsufficient theory based on the government's closing argument. \r\nCouched in different terms, it is still unconvincing.\r\nA variance occurs when the proof at trial paints a\r\nportrait that differs materially from the scenario detailed in the\r\nindictment.  See United States v. Vavlitis, 9 F.3d 206, 210 (1st\r\nCir. 1993).  A variance requires reversal of a conviction only if\r\nit is both material and prejudicial, for example, if the variance\r\nworks a substantial interference with the defendant's right to be\r\ninformed of the charges.  See Vavlitis, 9 F.3d at 210.  When, as\r\nhere, the indictment gives a defendant particular notice of the\r\nevents charged, and the proof at trial centers on those events,\r\nminor differences in the details of the facts charged, as\r\ncontrasted to those proved, are unlikely to be either material or\r\nprejudicial.\r\nThere was no variance between the evidence presented at\r\ntrial and the indictment.  The proof at trial is necessarily more\r\ndetailed than the facts alleged in the indictment, which is simply\r\na \"plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential\r\nfacts constituting the offense charged.\"  Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1). \r\nThe indictment charged a scheme to defraud encompassing the\r\nacquisition of insurance companies and the diversion of the\r\ncompanies' assets.  Paragraphs 28 to 44 of the Redacted Indictment\r\ndiscuss the fraudulent activity undertaken after the acquisition of\r\nthe insurance companies, and specifically refer to the Windbrook\r\nloan. See RI  36-38.  To the extent that: (1) the admission\r\nconcerning taking $1 million because of the amended release clause;\r\n(2) the failure to secure a waiver for the Windbrook loan; and (3)\r\nthe failure to comply with the Windbrook loan terms were not\r\nspecifically detailed in the indictment, these facts did not\r\nmaterially vary the nature of the charged fraudulent scheme.\r\nNo prejudice resulted because Reeder was not deprived \"of\r\nsufficiently specific information to prepare a defense, unfairly\r\nsurprise[d] . . . at trial, or isolate[d] . . . from the\r\nconstitutional protection against double jeopardy.\"  United States\r\nv. Fermn Castillo, 829 F.2d 1194, 1197 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\nIV.  Unanimity\r\nReeder argues that the district court erred in failing to\r\ninstruct the jurors that they had to unanimously agree on \"the\r\ntheories and acts of fraud\" underlying their guilty verdict.  We\r\nfind no such error.\r\nIn Schad v. Arizona, the Supreme Court held that, in\r\nreturning general verdicts in cases in which the government has\r\nalleged in a single count that the defendant committed the offense\r\nby one or more specified means, jurors are not required to agree\r\nupon a single means of commission.  See 501 U.S. 624, 631 (1991)\r\n(plurality opinion); id. at 649 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and\r\nconcurring in the judgment) (explaining that, for example, where \"a\r\nwoman's charred body has been found in a house, and there is ample\r\nevidence that the defendant set out to kill her,\" the jury does not\r\nhave to agree on whether defendant \"strangled victim to death,\" or\r\n\"left her unconscious and set the fire to kill her\").  While a jury\r\nmust agree on all of the elements of an offense, it need not agree\r\non the means by which all the elements were accomplished. \r\nHere, the jury was instructed that one of the elements of\r\nthe wire fraud counts was the defendant's knowing participation in\r\na scheme to defraud.  The government alleged and proved a single\r\nscheme to defraud.  While the jurors had to unanimously agree that\r\nReeder knowingly participated in a scheme to defraud -- an element\r\nof the crime -- they did not, contrary to Reeder's contention, have\r\nto unanimously agree on each piece of evidence offered to prove\r\nReeder's participation.\r\nV.  Attorney-Client Privilege\r\nAt trial, Reeder objected to the district court's\r\nadmission of Karma's testimony about his 1991 conversation with\r\nReeder, during which Reeder asked for Karma's help in covering up\r\nhis use of insurance company money.  The district court found that\r\nKarma's testimony was not protected by the attorney-client\r\nprivilege on two bases.  First, the court determined that the\r\nconversation was admissible under the crime-fraud exception to the\r\nattorney-client privilege.  Second, the court determined that\r\nReeder had waived the attorney-client privilege by failing to\r\nobject to Karma's extensive prior testimony about his\r\ncommunications with Reeder relating to the insurance company\r\ntransactions.  We agree with the district court that Reeder's \r\nconversation with Karma was admissible under the crime-fraud\r\nexception.\r\nThe importance and sanctity of the attorney-client\r\nprivilege is well established.  See  Upjohn v. United States, 449\r\nU.S. 383 (1981).  Because it \"'withhold[s] relevant information\r\nfrom the factfinder,'\" United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 562\r\n(1989) (citation omitted), the \"'attorney-client privilege does not\r\napply where the client consults an attorney to further a crime or\r\nfraud.'\"  Motley v. Marathon Oil Co., 71 F.3d 1547, 1551 (10th Cir.\r\n1995) (quoting In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Company X), 857 F.2d\r\n710, 712 (10th Cir. 1988)).  \"It is the purpose of the crime-fraud\r\nexception to the attorney-client privilege to assure that the 'seal\r\nof secrecy,'\" between lawyer and client does not extend to\r\ncommunications 'made for the purpose of getting advice for the\r\ncommission of a fraud' or crime.\"  Zolin, 491 U.S. at 563\r\n(citations omitted).  \"Thus, the attorney-client privilege is\r\nforfeited inter alia where the client sought the services of the\r\nlawyer to enable or aid the client to commit what the client knew\r\nor reasonably should have known to be a crime of fraud.\"  United\r\nStates v. Rakes, 136 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1998) (emphasis added).\r\nIn order to successfully invoke the crime-fraud\r\nexception, the government must make a prima facie showing that the\r\nattorney's assistance was sought in furtherance of a crime or\r\nfraud.  See In re Grand Jury Subpoenas (\"Subpoenas\"), 144 F.3d 653,\r\n660 (10th Cir. 1998); United States v. Jara, 973 F.2d 746, 748 (9th\r\nCir. 1992).  A district court's determination to admit evidence\r\nunder the crime-fraud exception is reviewed for abuse of\r\ndiscretion. See Subpoenas, 144 F.3d at 659; In re Grand Jury\r\nProceedings, 102 F.3d 748, 751 (4th Cir. 1996); In re Sealed Case,\r\n754 F.2d 395, 399-400 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  The facts underlying the\r\ndistrict court's decision on the crime-fraud exception are reviewed\r\nfor clear error.  See United States v. Jacobs, 117 F.3d 82, 87 (2d\r\nCir. 1997).\r\nThe record demonstrates that, in their 1991 conversation,\r\nReeder told Karma that he had \"a problem\" with some of the\r\ninsurance company transactions.  Reeder then admitted that he had\r\ntaken more than $1 million from the insurance companies, and handed\r\nKarma a document indicating that more than $1 million from the\r\ninsurance companies had not been properly applied.  Thereafter,\r\nReeder stated that he could explain how he had used the money. \r\nAfter reviewing the transactions, Karma said, \"This won't work. \r\nThe monies that were sent by American Universal were for work that\r\nhad been performed for liens that were already on the property.\" \r\nReeder responded, \"No problem. 'I can get my friends to write new\r\ninvoices and we'll pay them as of 1988.'\"  Karma told Reeder that\r\nto do so would be asking 20-30 people to commit fraud, that he did\r\nnot want any part of it, and he advised Reeder not to do it. \r\nReeder then stated, \"I thought maybe you could come up with some\r\nidea.\"  Karma once again refused to help Reeder cover up the\r\ntransactions,  responding, \"Wayne, it's a crime.  I don't want\r\nanything to do with it.  Don't ever discuss it with me again.\"  The\r\ndistrict court's determination that the government made a prima\r\nfacie showing that Reeder solicited Karma's assistance to cover up\r\nhis criminal conduct was not an abuse of discretion.  Reeder sought\r\nKarma's services to enable him to commit what he knew or reasonably\r\nshould have known to be fraud.  See Rakes, 136 F.3d at 4.\r\nReeder argues that the crime-fraud exception does not\r\napply because he was simply asking Karma's advice about whether he\r\ncould solve a problem in a particular manner.  The record belies\r\nReeder's assertion.  Reeder did not merely ask Karma whether\r\nbackdating invoices would be illegal, which would be equivalent to\r\nReeder's hypothetical about \"the head of a corporation asking his\r\ncounsel if he can condition a campaign contribution to a politician\r\non the politician's promise to support legislation.\"  Here, Reeder\r\ntwice asked for Karma's help in a cover-up of Reeder's fraudulent\r\ndiversion of the insurance companies' money.  See Subpoenas, 144\r\nF.3d at 660 (\"The exception does not apply if the assistance is\r\nsought only to disclose past wrongdoing, . . . but it does apply if\r\nthe assistance was used to cover up and perpetuate the crime or\r\nfraud.\").  Therefore, the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in admitting Karma's testimony under the crime-fraud\r\nexception.\r\nBecause we hold that the conversation was admissible\r\nunder the crime-fraud exception, there is no need to reach the\r\nwaiver issue.\r\nVI.  Evidentiary Rulings\r\nReeder challenges several of the district court's\r\nevidentiary rulings. We review a district court's rulings on\r\nadmissibility and relevance for abuse of discretion.  See Cassiere,\r\n4 F.3d at 1018.  Under Fed. R. Evid. 403, relevant evidence may be\r\nexcluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the\r\njury.  This Court grants the trial court \"especially wide latitude\"\r\nwhen Rule 403 balancing is the subject of review.  See United\r\nStates v. Rivera-Gmez, 67 F.3d 993, 996 (1st Cir. 1995).  \"[O]nly\r\nrarely -- and in extraordinary circumstances -- will we, from the\r\nvista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-\r\nthe-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative\r\nvalue and unfair effect.\"  Williams v. Drake, 146 F.3d 44, 47 (1st\r\nCir. 1998) (quotation omitted).\r\nFirst, Reeder argues that the district court erred in\r\nexcluding testimony from Karma and Reeder that the Windbrook loan\r\nwas restructured to substitute Resolute for Diamond as the payor. \r\nThe crime was completed when Reeder made the wire transfers in June\r\n1988, thereby diverting the insurance companies' funds for his own\r\npurposes.  Evidence of elaborate accounting transactions undertaken\r\nafter June 1988 to restructure the Windbrook loan are irrelevant to\r\nReeder's state of mind at the time that he misappropriated the\r\n$16.5 million.  In any event, any error in the exclusion was\r\nharmless because the district court allowed both Reeder and Ormand\r\nto testify that the Windbrook loan was rebooked as a loan from\r\nResolute.  See United States v. Brown, 938 F.2d 1482, 1488 (1st\r\nCir. 1991) (any error in the exclusion of evidence is rendered\r\nharmless where \"defendant's theory . . . was manifested to the jury\r\nthrough testimony which was allowed\").\r\nSecond, Reeder challenges the district court's exclusion\r\nof notes taken by Bence, Karma's law partner, during a June 13,\r\n1988, conversation with Ormand, to the effect that Ormand did not\r\nthink that the Windbrook loan violated state insurance laws.  This\r\nevidence was inadmissible because Reeder failed to lay a proper\r\nevidentiary foundation.  Reeder sought to introduce this exhibit\r\nthrough Karma.  Karma testified, however, that he did not know what\r\nBence discussed with Ormand that day.  Reeder thus sought to\r\nintroduce \"Mr. Ormand's opinion as expressed to Mr. Bence as\r\nrecorded by Mr. Bence on a paper that's in this witness's [Karma's]\r\nfile,\" about a conversation that Karma had already testified he\r\nknew nothing about.  The district court suggested that the document\r\nmight be admissible through Ormand, that defense counsel could\r\noffer it through Bence, or that Reeder could testify about it. \r\nReeder did not pursue any of these avenues.  Consequently, the\r\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in determining that\r\nthis document could not be introduced through Karma.\r\nThird, Reeder argues that the district court erroneously\r\nexcluded evidence demonstrating that various people knew about the\r\nWindbrook loan.  Reeder sought to introduce through Durfee,\r\nAmerican's Chief Financial Officer, a letter that Durfee wrote to\r\nOrmand referring to the documents that were required in order to\r\nmake certain booking entries at American regarding the\r\nrestructuring of the Windbrook loan.  The government objected based\r\non relevance.  The court queried where the original documents\r\nsupporting the book entries referred to in the letter were, and\r\ndefense counsel stated that he did not have them.  The court then\r\nexcluded the exhibit on the basis that this evidence was \"secondary\r\nat best\" and explained, \"I think we need something a little\r\nbetter.\"  The court also stated, \"Certainly, you can ask this\r\nwitness if he has a recollection if this was recorded on the\r\nbooks.\"  Defense counsel failed to ask that question.  The district\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Reeder had failed\r\nto lay a proper foundation for the admissibility of the Durfee\r\nletter by failing to produce the documents that would support the\r\naccounting entries discussed in the letter.\r\nLater, Reeder sought testimony from Durfee as to whether\r\nthe Windbrook loan was restructured so that it became a receivable\r\nof Resolute rather than Diamond.  As discussed above, the district\r\ncourt did not exceed its discretion in determining that the\r\nrelevance of that testimony was substantially outweighed by the\r\nconfusion it would bring to the case.  Moreover, Durfee was allowed\r\nto testify that he was aware of the Windbrook loan and of the wire\r\ntransfers from Diamond's account at Fleet Bank, thereby supporting\r\nReeder's defense that many people were aware of the loan.\r\nOn re-cross examination of Ormand, Reeder sought to\r\nintroduce an August 9, 1988, letter Ormand sent to one of\r\nResolute's other lawyers that discussed some of the transactions\r\ninvolved in the restructuring of the Windbrook loan.  Ormand\r\ntestified that he did not know if a copy was mailed to Comey,\r\nDiamond's President, but that a copy \"probably was sent\" to her. \r\nComey had testified that she did not remember receiving the letter. \r\nThe district court sustained the government's objection that the\r\nletter was inadmissible hearsay and irrelevant.  Reeder argues that\r\nthis evidence would have demonstrated that Diamond executives were\r\naware of the restructuring, and would have refuted Comey's prior\r\ntestimony that she had difficulty obtaining information about the\r\nwhereabouts of the LACOP money.\r\nThe district court's ruling was proper.  First, the\r\ndocument was inadmissible hearsay with respect to the facts\r\ncontained within it.  Second, the document was not admissible to\r\nimpeach Comey, because Reeder failed to establish a proper\r\nfoundation that the letter was even sent to Comey, let alone\r\nwhether she received it.  Third, the district court's decision that\r\nthe evidence was outside the limited scope of a re-cross\r\nexamination was not an abuse of discretion.  Fourth, the district\r\ncourt's decision that evidence relating to the details of the\r\nrestructuring was irrelevant was not an abuse of discretion.\r\nFinally, Reeder sought to introduce notes Ormand took\r\nduring a March 1988 conversation with Susan Gallinger, Resolute's\r\nlocal counsel in Arizona, in which they discussed the feasibility\r\nof having Diamond purchase the liens.  The court properly sustained\r\nthe government's objection that the notes were inadmissible\r\nhearsay.  Reeder does not even attempt to argue that the district\r\ncourt's ruling was erroneous.  Nor does Reeder explain how this\r\nevidence was relevant to demonstrating that regulators or insurance\r\ncompany executives were aware of the Windbrook loan, or how the\r\nexclusion of this evidence affected his defense.  Thus, the\r\nevidence was properly excluded.\r\nContrary to Reeder's assertion, the district court's\r\nevidentiary rulings taken together did not amount to a Sixth\r\nAmendment violation eviscerating his defense.  Under the\r\nConstitution, a defendant \"does not have an unfettered right to\r\noffer [evidence] that is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise\r\ninadmissible under standard rules of evidence.\"  Montana v.Egelhoff, 518 U.S. 37, 42 (1996) (quoting Taylor v. Illinois, 484\r\nU.S. 400, 410 (1988)); United States v. Kepreos, 759 F.2d 961, 964\r\n(1st Cir.) (same), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 901 (1985).  The district\r\ncourt's rulings were proper and within its discretion.\r\nVII.  Sentencing Issues\r\nReeder was sentenced under Guideline  2F1.1 of the 1988\r\nSentencing Guidelines Manual.  His base offense level was 6.  The\r\ncourt imposed an 11-level upward adjustment because the amount of\r\nloss involved exceeded $5 million.  In imposing the upward\r\nadjustment, the district court found that the loss in this case was\r\n$16.5 million, the money Reeder had Christopher divert from the\r\nFleet Bank account for Reeder's benefit.  The court added two more\r\noffense levels because the offense involved more than minimal\r\nplanning or a scheme to defraud more than one victim, and imposed\r\na four-level role in the offense enhancement.  As a result,\r\nReeder's total offense level was determined to be 23.  Reeder was\r\nassigned to Criminal History Category I, resulting in a guidelines\r\nrange of 46-57 months.  The district court sentenced him to 46\r\nmonths of imprisonment.  Reeder argues that the district court: (1)\r\nincorrectly calculated the amount of the loss; and (2) incorrectly\r\nimposed a four-level role in the offense enhancement.  Neither\r\nargument is persuasive.\r\nA.  Loss calculation\r\nReeder challenges the district court's loss calculation.\r\nHe argues that the $16.5 million figure cannot be used in\r\ncalculating his offense level because the government argued in the\r\nChristopher case that Christopher alone was responsible for that\r\nloss.\r\nUnder the Guidelines, loss is the \"value of the property\r\ntaken.\"  U.S.S.G.  2B1.1 comment. 2 (1988) (cross-referenced from\r\n2F1.1)).  After adding 11 levels to Reeder's base offense level\r\nbecause the amount of loss exceeded $5 million, the court declined\r\nto grant a downward departure based on Reeder's argument that the\r\nloss amount overstated the seriousness of his offense because\r\nChristopher contributed to the loss.\r\n\"[T]he victim loss table in  U.S.S.G. 2F1.1(b)(1)\r\npresumes that the defendant alone is responsible for the entire\r\namount of victim loss specified in the particular loss range\r\nselected by the sentencing court.\"  United States v. Gregorio, 956\r\nF.2d 341, 346 (1st Cir. 1992).  Any portion of the total loss\r\nsustained by the victim as a consequence of factors extraneous to\r\nthe defendant's criminal conduct is not deducted from total \"victim\r\nloss\" prior to the determination of the applicable guideline\r\nsentencing range pursuant to  U.S.S.G.  2F1.1(b)(1).  See id. at\r\n347 (\"victim loss\" table encapsulates \"heartland\" sentencing\r\nformula for reflecting approximate total \"victim loss\" in the\r\nguideline sentencing range).  Rather, whatever distortive effects\r\nextraneous causes may have had on the total \"victim loss\"\r\ncalculation may warrant a departure from the applicable guideline\r\nsentencing range.  See  U.S.S.G. 2F1.1, comment. (n. 10)\r\n(\"downward departure may be warranted\" where \"total dollar loss\r\nthat results from the offense may overstate its seriousness,\" which\r\n\"typically occur[s]\" when defendant's fraud \"is not the sole cause\r\nof the loss\"); United States v. Kopp, 951 F.2d 521, 531 (3d Cir.\r\n1991) (\"To the extent actual loss had other, more proximate causes,\r\na discretionary downward departure -- but not a mandatory 'loss'\r\nadjustment -- might be appropriate.\").\r\nWe lack jurisdiction to review the district court's\r\ndecision not to depart downward under the long-standing rule that\r\n\"a criminal defendant cannot ground an appeal on a sentencing\r\ncourt's discretionary decision not to depart below the guideline\r\nsentencing range.\"  United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st\r\nCir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1119 (1995);  see generally,\r\nUnited States v. Tucker, 892 F.2d 8, 9 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding\r\nthat the defendant may not appeal a district court's decision not\r\nto depart downward).\r\nReeder attempts to circumvent the limitations on this\r\nCourt's review of departure decisions by recasting his argument as\r\nan attack on the loss amount used in calculating the adjusted\r\noffense level.  This Court has clearly held, however, that \r\n\n[a]ny portion of the total loss sustained by\r\nthe victim as a consequence of factors\r\nextraneous to the defendant's criminal conduct\r\nis not deducted from total \"victim loss\" prior\r\nto the determination of the applicable\r\nguideline sentencing range . . . . Rather,\r\nwhatever distortive effects extraneous causes\r\nmay have had on the total \"victim loss\"\r\ncalculation may warrant a departure from the\r\napplicable [guideline range].\r\n\nUnited States v. Shattuck, 961 F.2d 1012, 1016-17 (1st Cir. 1992). \r\nThus, Reeder's argument that the district court erred in failing to\r\nconsider other causes, such as Christopher's participation, for the\r\nloss in calculating Reeder's adjusted offense level is incorrect as\r\na matter of law.\r\nSecond, Reeder argues that the loss amount attributed to\r\nhim should be offset by the property that was eventually forfeited\r\nto the insurance companies.  That contention is foreclosed by our\r\ndecision in Christopher.  As we stated there: \"To reduce the loss\r\nby the value of the foreclosed collateral . . . would double count:\r\nthe insurance companies were entitled to the protection of lien-\r\nfree collateral without having to reduce their own capital in order\r\nto pay off the liens.\"  Christopher, 142 F.3d at 55.  Thus,\r\nReeder's effort to distinguish himself from Christopher on the\r\nbasis that Reeder contributed properties to the companies is\r\nunavailing.  If not for Reeder's diversion of funds, the insurance\r\ncompanies would have the forfeited collateral and the $16.5\r\nmillion.  As the district court stated, \"What [Reeder] want[s] is\r\ncredit for what he left in the bank after he robbed it.\"     B.  Offense Enhancement\r\nReeder challenges the four-level enhancement for his role\r\nas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved (1)\r\nfive or more participants or (2) was otherwise extensive.  See \r\nU.S.S.G.  3B1.1(a).  Reeder contends only that he did not lead or\r\norganize five or more persons who were \"criminally responsible\" for\r\nthe offense.  He makes no argument that the criminal activity was\r\nnot \"otherwise extensive,\" the basis for the district court's\r\nenhancement.  United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 413 (1st Cir.\r\n1995) (extensiveness prong does not depend on number of\r\nparticipants).  Reeder's assertion that Christopher was the true\r\nleader is irrelevant.  The district court found that Reeder had\r\nultimate control of Resolute, placed Christopher in charge of the\r\ninsurance companies, and directed the disposition of monies taken\r\nfrom the companies.  A careful review of the record leaves no doubt\r\nas to the extensiveness of the criminal enterprise.\r\n                  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm.\n",

Our\r\npresentation of the facts draws considerably on our recent opinion\r\nin United States v. Christopher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197916\"><a href=\"/opinion/197916/united-states-v-christopher/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nIn mid-1987, Charles Christopher and other investors\r\nformed a holding company called Resolute Holdings, Inc.\r\n(\"Resolute\") for the purpose of acquiring insurance companies. \r\nResolute sought to acquire American Universal Insurance Company\r\n(\"American\"), an insurer headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island,\r\nand Diamond Benefits Life Insurance Company (\"Diamond\"), an insurer\r\nthat was licensed in Arizona and had its principal offices in\r\nCalifornia.  Resolute, however, was a shell company, with no assets\r\nexcept $250,000 in working capital.  In late 1987, Christopher and\r\nResolute enlisted the participation of Reeder, a California\r\ndeveloper who had real estate holdings and controlled several\r\ncompanies, including Hill Top Developers (\"Hill Top\").  Reeder\r\nagreed to contribute capital to the insurance companies in exchange\r\nfor a share in Resolute.\r\nIn early February 1988, Reeder negotiated a deal with\r\nResolute.  Under the terms of Reeder's deal with Resolute, in\r\nexchange for Reeder's capital contribution to the insurance\r\ncompanies, Reeder received a 60% share of Resolute and about $2\r\nmillion in yearly profit participation.  Reeder thus acquired a\r\ncontrolling interest in Resolute, although the formal transfer of\r\nResolute shares to Reeder did not become official until June 1988.\r\nIn addition to reaching an agreement with the respective\r\nsellers of American and Diamond, Resolute had to obtain the\r\napproval of state insurance regulatory authorities.  By statute,\r\nthe Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation (\"RIDBR\") had to\r\napprove the sale of American, and the Departments of Insurance in\r\nboth Arizona and California had to approve the sale of Diamond. \r\nResolute submitted an application, known as a Form A statement, to\r\neach of those three states.  Each Form A required the disclosure of\r\nextensive background and financial information about the\r\nindividuals involved in the acquisition, their business plan for\r\nthe company, and the financial means by which the company would be\r\nacquired, so that the regulators could assess whether the\r\nacquisition would jeopardize the interests of policyholders.\r\nAs part of its acquisition plan submitted to the\r\ninsurance regulators, Resolute agreed to capitalize the insurance\r\ncompanies by contributing Reeder's $50 million promissory note,\r\nsecured by Heritage Ranch and Indian Palms, to American.  To\r\ncapitalize Diamond, Resolute agreed to contribute Reeder's $12\r\nmillion promissory note, secured by Indian Springs.\r\nThe acquisition of Diamond had an additional component. \r\nResolute had negotiated for Diamond to assume a block of annuity\r\npolicies from the Life Assurance Company of Pennsylvania (\"LACOP\"). \r\nAs consideration for its assumption of about $31 million in LACOP's\r\nannuity obligations, Diamond was to receive about $29.4 million in\r\ncash from LACOP.  Of that sum, $18 million was to be delivered to\r\nDiamond at closing, with the remainder to follow several months\r\nlater.\r\nAt the time of Resolute's Form A applications, all of the\r\nReeder properties securing Reeder's promissory notes -- Heritage\r\nRanch, Indian Palms, and Indian Springs -- had extensive liens on\r\nthem.  On Heritage Ranch and Indian Palms alone, the total was\r\nabout $17 million.  Those preexisting liens were significant\r\nbecause they meant that American's and Diamond's security interests\r\nwould be subordinated to other mortgages on the properties.  In\r\naddition, pre-existing liens on the collateral decreased the value\r\nof the promissory notes, thereby decreasing the amount of capital\r\nwith which the insurance companies could do business.\r\nIn February 1988, Reeder made a deal with Christopher\r\nthat Resolute would purchase Reeder's liens from the banks so that\r\nthe closings could go forward.  Reeder and Resolute made repeated\r\nrepresentations to the insurance regulators that the pre-existing\r\nliens on the Reeder properties would be cleared by closing.  At the\r\nsame time that these representations were being made, however,\r\nReeder was repeatedly advised that Resolute had no means by which\r\nto pay the debt.\r\nIn the Form A filings submitted to Rhode Island, Arizona,\r\nand California, Resolute represented that all pre-existing liens on\r\nthe collateral securing its promissory notes to the insurance\r\ncompanies would be discharged at or before closing on Resolute's\r\nacquisition.\r\nOn March 10, 1988, Arizona approved Resolute's\r\nacquisition of Diamond.  Resolute understood that, by Diamond's\r\nclosing, it still had to provide documentation demonstrating that\r\nthe pre-existing liens on the property securing the notes to\r\nDiamond had been cleared.\r\nThe Rhode Island regulators were particularly concerned\r\nabout the encumbrances on the property securing the promissory note\r\nto American.  In late April, RIDBR chief legal counsel Nancy Mayer\r\nwrote to Resolute asking whether Reeder's corporations owned\r\nHeritage Ranch and Indian Palms \"free and clear of all\r\nencumbrances.\"\r\nReeder later admitted that he knew that the liens would\r\nnot be paid off by the closings on the insurance companies, despite\r\nthe representations to the regulators.  Nevertheless, Reeder was\r\nstill actively involved in the acquisition of the insurance\r\ncompanies.  On May 24, Reeder had a meeting with Christopher and\r\nseveral other Resolute principals to decide who was going to run\r\nthe insurance companies.  Reeder, soon to be the majority\r\nshareholder of Resolute, had the ultimate authority to make that\r\ndecision.  Against the strong opposition of the other Resolute\r\nprincipals, Reeder placed Christopher in charge of the insurance\r\ncompanies.\r\nThe RIDBR scheduled an approval hearing on the American\r\nacquisition for May 26.  On May 24, just two days prior to that\r\nhearing -- when Reeder knew that the American closing was imminent\r\n-- Reeder signed a number of documents relating to the purchase of\r\nAmerican, including a capitalization agreement that was submitted\r\nto the RIDBR as part of the Form A application.  In the\r\ncapitalization agreement, Reeder represented that, \"[t]here are no\r\nactions, suits or proceedings, pending or threatened, to the\r\ncurrent actual knowledge of the Makers, effecting [sic] the $50\r\nMillion Note or any portion of the property, at law or in equity or\r\nbefore or by any federal, state, municipal or other governmental\r\ndepartment, commission, [or] board.\"  This statement was not true. \r\nReeder knew that suits were threatened against both Heritage Ranch\r\nand Indian Palms, the two properties securing the $50 million\r\npromissory note to American.\r\nAt the time Reeder signed the capitalization agreement,\r\nReeder had a $10 million note outstanding with Continental Bank,\r\nsecured by Heritage Ranch.  Reeder had missed a $2.3 million\r\namortization payment due in October 1987.  In a meeting with\r\nContinental in December 1987, Reeder told the bank that he did not\r\nhave the cash to meet his obligations under the loan.  On March 11,\r\n1988, Continental notified Reeder that he was in default and that\r\nthe bank might institute foreclosure proceedings.  On April 29,\r\nContinental demanded full payment on the loan, and on June 3, 1988,\r\nContinental filed for foreclosure on Heritage Ranch.\r\nReeder was also delinquent on several loans he had\r\noutstanding with Home Federal Bank (\"Home Fed\").  Reeder owed Home\r\nFed more than $7 million for loans that were secured by both\r\nHeritage Ranch and Indian Palms, and he had not made payments on\r\ncertain loans since June 1987.  On May 12, Home Fed demanded\r\npayment in full on one of the loans secured by Heritage Ranch.\r\nOn May 26, 1988, Rhode Island held the approval hearing\r\non the proposed acquisition of American by Resolute.  Resolute\r\nmaintained its position that it would pay off the pre-existing\r\nliens on the Reeder properties securing the promissory note by\r\nclosing.  Indeed, at some point that day, although not at the\r\nformal hearing, RIDBR Chief Counsel Mayer was told that the pre-\r\nexisting liens on the Reeder properties had been cleared.\r\nOn May 27, 1988, the RIDBR issued a conditional order\r\napproving Resolute's acquisition of American.  Although the\r\ntransaction closed that day, the order made clear that the transfer\r\nof ownership would not become final until Resolute submitted final\r\ntitle insurance policies for Heritage Ranch and Indian Palms \"to be\r\neffective as of the closing date which indicat[e]\" that \"all\r\nmortgages, deeds of trust and the like have been paid in full and\r\ndischarged.\"  On June 7, 1988, California issued an order approving\r\nResolute's acquisition of Diamond, which Arizona had already\r\napproved on March 10.  The extensive liens on Heritage Ranch,\r\nIndian Palms, and Indian Springs were not paid off by May 27, when\r\nthe American purchase closed, nor by June 14, when the Diamond\r\npurchase closed.\r\nOn May 28, 1988, Christopher told Reeder that the\r\nregulators had approved the American acquisition.  A few days\r\nlater, Reeder and Christopher had a private meeting to discuss the\r\nacquisitions at Reeder's office in California.  Christopher\r\nconfirmed that the liens on Reeder's properties had not yet been\r\ndischarged.  Reeder became angry when Christopher informed him that\r\nthe Rhode Island regulators had amended the release clause\r\nprovision of Reeder's promissory note to American.\r\nThe release clause governed the rate at which Reeder had\r\nto pay down the balance on the $50 million promissory note to\r\nAmerican if he sold portions of the properties securing the note. \r\nUnder the original provision, Reeder was required to pay American\r\nonly 110% of the appraised value of each lot sold, even though the\r\nlots could be sold for a price considerably higher than the\r\nappraised value.  Under the amended release clause, all monies\r\nreceived from the sales of portions of the properties securing the\r\nnote had to be applied to reducing the principal balance of the\r\nnote.  Reeder could not receive any monies from the sale of the\r\nlots until the $50 million note had been paid off in its entirety. \r\nNor could Reeder take money from the insurance companies for\r\ndevelopment costs associated with Heritage Ranch or Indian Palms. \r\nReeder found the amended release clause to be \"untenable,\" because\r\nit deprived him of the steady cash flow he had expected from the\r\nsale of lots at Heritage Ranch and Indian Palms.\r\nReeder arranged with Christopher, in an oral agreement\r\nwith no documentation, for an $18 million \"loan\" to Hill Top.  The\r\n\"loan\" was to be secured by Windbrook Country Club, yet another of\r\nReeder's properties, which was worth only $3 million.  Although\r\nReeder later said that, he expected that Resolute would be the\r\nentity loaning Hill Top funds under the Windbrook \"loan,\" Reeder\r\nknew that Resolute had no assets except the insurance companies. \r\nReeder also knew that, upon Resolute's acquisition of Diamond,\r\nDiamond was to receive the  LACOP annuity money, the first\r\ninstallment of which was in the amount of $18 million -- the same\r\namount as the Windbrook loan.\r\nOn June 13, Reeder signed the documents for the Windbrook\r\nloan.  Under the terms of the Windbrook loan, Diamond -- not\r\nResolute -- agreed to lend Hill Top up to $18 million to pay off\r\nliens on Heritage Ranch, Indian Palms, and Windbrook Country Club. \r\nThe documents were dated June 15, 1988 -- the day after the\r\nexpected Diamond closing.\r\nThe Windbrook loan violated state regulatory\r\nrequirements.  Under Arizona insurance regulations, Diamond could\r\nnot advance loan proceeds in an amount greater than the value of\r\nthe collateral backing the loan.  In addition, it could not invest\r\nmore than 10% of its assets in a single investment.   No waiver was\r\nrequested or received for the $18 million Windbrook loan.  In\r\naddition, the insurance regulators required that the money to pay\r\noff the liens come from an external source.\r\nAfter Reeder's private meeting with Christopher about the\r\nWindbrook loan, Reeder began settlement negotiations with\r\nContinental and Home Fed over his outstanding loan obligations.  On\r\nJune 7, Reeder reached a settlement with Continental for a\r\n\"discounted note payoff\" in which Reeder agreed to pay off his $10\r\nmillion note to Continental for about $8.7 million.  Reeder\r\narranged for the payment to be due on June 16 -- two days after the\r\nanticipated Diamond closing.\r\nOn June 10, Resolute shareholders met in Dallas, Texas\r\nfor their first meeting.  One of Reeder's attorneys, Arthur Karma\r\nattended the meeting as a proxy for Reeder, the controlling\r\nshareholder.  Pursuant to Reeder's instructions, Karma voted to\r\nmake Christopher a director of both insurance companies, as well as\r\nthe new President of American and the CEO of Diamond.  In addition,\r\nReeder had twice instructed Karma to make certain that Christopher\r\npaid off the Continental loan, which Reeder had settled a few days\r\nearlier.  Karma related Reeder's message to Christopher, and\r\nChristopher said the liens would be paid in the next few days.\r\nUnbeknownst to Colleen Comey, the President of Diamond,\r\non June 13, the day before the closing on Diamond, Christopher\r\ndirected Keith Bell, an employee of American, to open an account in\r\nDiamond's name at Fleet Bank in Providence, Rhode Island.  On\r\nJune 15, the day after Diamond's closing, Christopher directed Bell\r\nto have LACOP transfer the first installment of $18 million owed to\r\nDiamond to the Fleet Bank account.\r\nOnce the $18 million was deposited in the Fleet Bank\r\naccount, Christopher directed Bell to make a series of wire\r\ndisbursements.  Five of those transfers were pursuant to Reeder's\r\ndirections and for Reeder's benefit.\r\nOn June 16, Reeder caused $8.7 million to be sent from\r\nthe Diamond account to Continental Bank in Chicago, per the\r\nsettlement he had reached with the bank on June 7.  This payment\r\nextinguished the most substantial pre-existing lien on Heritage\r\nRanch.\r\nAlso on June 16, 1988, Reeder caused $465,000 to be\r\ntransferred to an account of the Burrillville Land Company in Santa\r\nMonica, California.  Reeder had no interest in that company or its\r\naccounts.  Burrillville, however, was managed by Carlsberg\r\nManagement, which was closely associated with Reeder's businesses. \r\nThen, on June 17, through written instructions, Reeder had the\r\naccount manager, Theresa DeLeon, allocate the $465,000 into three\r\nseparate checks for $100,000, $315,000, and $50,000, all payable to\r\nHill Top.\r\nOn June 23, 1988, Reeder caused $825,000 to be\r\ntransferred to the client trust account of James Patison, the\r\nlawyer who had negotiated the Home Fed settlement for Reeder. \r\nReeder stated that this $825,000 transfer, which he discussed with\r\nChristopher at their private meeting in early June, involved\r\npayments to Reeder of funds he felt he was owed by Home Fed in\r\nconnection with two joint ventures Home Fed and Reeder had engaged\r\nin:  Whimpy Gentry and Rancho 187.  Reeder's settlement agreement\r\nwith Home Fed, however, stated that it resolved all disputes\r\nbetween the parties, including those two matters.  Reeder admitted\r\nthat the insurance companies were wholly unrelated to those two\r\nprojects.  Reeder also admitted that the $825,000 transfer\r\nrepresented a portion of the discount he was able to negotiate in\r\nhis settlement with Home Fed.\r\nOn June 23, 1988, Reeder caused $459,000 to be\r\ntransferred to Carlsberg Management.  As with the earlier transfer\r\nto Burrillville, Reeder gave DeLeon written instructions on how to\r\ndisburse the funds.  The same day the funds were received, DeLeon\r\ncut two checks: one for $384,000 payable to Hill Top, and one for\r\n$75,000 payable to a Reeder intercorporate account.  Reeder stated\r\nthat this wire transfer, as well as the prior June 16 transfer of\r\n$465,000, represented the approximately $1 million discount he had\r\nnegotiated on his outstanding debt with Continental Bank.  Reeder\r\nalso admitted that he had made an agreement with Christopher at\r\ntheir early June meeting to take these amounts, as compensation for\r\nthe amended release clause, for development costs at Heritage  \r\nRanch -- a use that was prohibited by the regulators.\r\nReeder had signed the settlement agreement with Home Fed\r\non June 22, which required him to pay Home Fed approximately $5.9\r\nmillion.  The Diamond account at Fleet Bank, however, had been\r\nnearly exhausted by this time and did not have sufficient funds to\r\ncover that amount.  Therefore, $3 million was transferred to\r\nDiamond's Fleet account from an American account without any\r\njustification or supporting documentation.\r\nThen, on June 24, 1988, Reeder caused approximately $5.9\r\nmillion to be transferred from the Fleet account to Home Fed in\r\npayment of Reeder's obligations to that bank.\r\nThe total amount taken from the insurance companies for\r\nReeder's benefit was approximately $16.5 million, consisting of\r\n$13.5 million taken from Diamond and $3 million taken from\r\nAmerican.\r\nBy August 1988, Colleen Comey, Diamond's President, had\r\nbecome concerned about the whereabouts of the LACOP money.  At that\r\npoint, as annuity holders attempted to cash in their policies,\r\nDiamond was writing checks that were returned for insufficient\r\nfunds.  When Comey began inquiring whether the LACOP money had been\r\nreceived, she learned that it was gone.  In trying to determine how\r\nthe money had been spent, she was unable to reconstruct the\r\ntransactions.  Finally, after failing to receive an adequate\r\nexplanation from Christopher, Comey called Reeder to report her\r\nconcerns about the missing $18 million and make further inquiries. \r\nReeder expressed no surprise at all when Comey informed him of the\r\nmissing $18 million, but he gave her no information about the\r\nmissing money, simply telling her to speak to Christopher or\r\nWilliam Geary, another Resolute principal.  On September 22, 1988,\r\nconcerned that the second installment of $10 million soon due from\r\nLACOP would likewise disappear, Comey froze the Fleet account and\r\nalerted regulators. The next day she was fired.\r\n                  DISCUSSION\r\nI.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nWhen a defendant challenges his criminal conviction,\r\nclaiming that the government failed to present sufficient evidence\r\nto prove the defendant guilty of the charged crime, the court must\r\n\"view the evidence, together with all reasonable inferences that\r\nmay be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the\r\ngovernment,\" United States v.

Wire Fraud\r\nReeder argues that his wire fraud convictions cannot\r\nstand because there is no evidence in the record that he knew that\r\nChristopher's assurances concerning the liens were false, much less\r\nthat he shared Christopher's intent to deceive and defraud the\r\nregulators.  See Defendant's Br. at 21.  We find his argument\r\nunpersuasive.\r\nTo prove wire fraud, the government must establish beyond\r\na reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant's knowing and willing\r\nparticipation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with the specific\r\nintent to defraud; and (2) the use of interstate wire\r\ncommunications in furtherance of the scheme.  See United States v.\r\nSawyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196785\"><a href=\"/opinion/196785/united-states-v-sawyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 723 (1st Cir. 1996).  \r\nReeder challenges only the intent element.  He concedes\r\nthat Resolute and Christopher made numerous representations to the\r\nregulators that the liens on Reeder's properties would be paid off\r\nby closing.  He also admits that Christopher made these\r\nmisrepresentations with the intent to deceive as part of a scheme\r\nto defraud the insurance regulators.  Reeder's argument is that the\r\nevidence does not demonstrate that he knew those representations to\r\nbe false because he allegedly believed that Resolute would pay off\r\nthe liens.\r\nAt trial, Reeder testified that he did not expect that\r\nthe liens would be paid off by closing, and that he did not think\r\nthat Resolute would pay off the liens before closing.  Reeder's own\r\ntestimony provided evidence that, despite the repeated\r\nrepresentations made to the insurance regulators that the pre-\r\nexisting liens on his properties would be cleared by closing,\r\nReeder knew that the liens would not be discharged at that time.\r\nFurthermore, Reeder was the de facto majority shareholder\r\nof Resolute.  He admitted that the huge amount of money he was\r\nfronting for the insurance companies was too much to be put at risk\r\nwithout control of Resolute.  Although Reeder did not formally\r\nreceive his shares in Resolute until June 1988, the jury was\r\nentitled to infer that he was the one making decisions for Resolute\r\nbefore that time, as he was on May 24 when he placed Christopher in\r\ncharge of the insurance companies.  The evidence further showed\r\nthat Reeder kept in close and direct contact with Christopher\r\nthroughout the acquisition process, and Jarrell Ormand, Resolute's\r\nlawyer in Texas, communicated with Reeder in responding to\r\ninquiries from the RIDBR.  From this evidence, the jury could infer\r\nthat Reeder was intimately involved with Resolute's effort to\r\nacquire the insurance companies and responsible for the\r\nrepresentations made to the regulators on behalf of Resolute that\r\nthe liens on his properties would be cleared by closing.\r\nThe evidence also demonstrated that Reeder knew that\r\nResolute had no means by which to pay off the liens.  In letters on\r\nMarch 11, May 13, and May 20, Karma and his law partner, David\r\nBence, informed Reeder of their increasing concern over Resolute's\r\nfailure to make any arrangements to discharge the debt.  Reeder,\r\nhowever, ignored their pleas for a meeting, and instead made his\r\nown false representation to the regulators that no suits were\r\nthreatened against the properties backing his promissory note to\r\nAmerican, even though two banks were about to initiate foreclosure\r\nproceedings.  From this sequence of events, the jury could\r\nreasonably infer that Reeder was aware of the fact that the liens\r\non his properties would not be paid off by closing, and that he\r\nintended to deceive the regulators when he and Resolute made the\r\nrepeated representations that his properties would be unencumbered\r\nupon Resolute's acquisition of the insurance companies.

Cassiere, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194928\"><a href=\"/opinion/194928/united-states-v-cassiere/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1024 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"Guilty\r\nknowledge may be inferred where instances of fraud are repeatedly\r\nbrought to a defendant's attention without prompting alteration of\r\nhis facilitative conduct.\") (quotation omitted).\r\nIn support of his assertion that he believed that\r\nResolute would discharge his liens, Reeder relies primarily on\r\nstatements made by him, his corporations, or Christopher and his\r\nagents that Resolute would pay off the liens.  The simple fact that\r\nthose statements were made, however, does not prove that Reeder\r\nbelieved them.  Moreover, the jury was entitled not only to\r\ndisbelieve Reeder's statements, but also \"[to] legitimately . . .\r\npresume[] that the fabrication[s] w[ere] all the more proof of\r\n[his] guilt.\"  United States v. Jimnez-Prez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519199\"><a href=\"/opinion/519199/united-states-v-joaquin-jimenez-perez-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (1st.\r\nCir. 1989).\r\nReeder's participation in making misrepresentations to\r\nthe regulators, his use of the wires to divert $16.5 million of the\r\ninsurance companies' funds, and his fraudulent efforts to conceal\r\nhis actions overwhelmingly establish his intentional participation\r\nin the scheme to defraud.  Based on this evidence, a rational trier\r\nof fact could easily have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nB.  Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property (\"ITSP\")\r\nReeder contends that his ITSP convictions must be\r\noverturned because the government failed to prove that he knew that\r\nthe property was taken by fraud.  We disagree.\r\nTo convict on the five ITSP counts, the jury had to find\r\nthat Reeder transported in interstate commerce $5,000 or more that\r\nhe knew to have been stolen, converted, or taken by fraud.  SeeDowling v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111502\"><a href=\"/opinion/111502/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 214 (1985) (stating the\r\nelements of 18 U.S.C.  2314).  Reeder agrees that Christopher\r\nengaged in a scheme to defraud, and, as explained above, the\r\nevidence demonstrates that, after the insurance companies were\r\nacquired, Reeder entered into an agreement with Christopher to\r\ndivert $16.5 million of the insurance companies' funds for his own\r\npurposes and structured the transactions to conceal his activities. \r\nBased on that evidence alone, the jury could reasonably infer that\r\nReeder knew that the money he transported had been taken by fraud.\r\nII.  Government's Closing Argument\r\nReeder argues that his convictions must be reversed\r\nbecause the government's closing argument misled the jury into\r\nfinding guilt based on conduct not amounting to fraud.  At trial,\r\nReeder did not object to any portion of the prosecutor's closing\r\nargument.  Therefore, his claim is reviewed only for plain error. \r\nSee United States v. Young, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111353\"><a href=\"/opinion/111353/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6, 14-15 (1985).\r\nReeder contends that the prosecutor argued that the jury\r\ncould convict Reeder of wire fraud based: (1) on his admission that\r\nhe took $1 million from the insurance companies in response to the\r\namended release clause; (2) on his violation of a state regulation\r\nby failing to secure a waiver from Arizona for the Windbrook loan;\r\nor (3) on his failure to comply with the Windbrook contract terms\r\nby taking money for purposes other than the discharge of liens. \r\nReeder contends that such proof would be insufficient to sustain\r\nhis convictions because it would not constitute \"a fraud in\r\nobtaining the property.\"  Defendant's Br. at 30.\r\nContrary to Reeder's assertions, the government did not\r\nargue to the jury that it could convict Reeder of fraud if it found\r\nsimply that he had taken $1 million from the insurance companies,\r\nviolated a state regulation, or disregarded the loan terms.\r\nWe consider the prosecutor's comments within the\r\nframework and context of the entire case. See United States v.Morales-Cartagena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601780\"><a href=\"/opinion/601780/united-states-v-angel-luis-morales-cartagena-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 854 (1st Cir. 1993).  Evidence at\r\ntrial demonstrated that Reeder: (1) admitted that he took $1\r\nmillion from the insurance companies; (2) failed to disclose or\r\nsecure a waiver from the state regulators for the Windbrook \"loan\"\r\ndespite his knowledge that insurance company transactions were\r\nsubject to strict oversight; and (3) took money from the insurance\r\ncompanies for purposes unrelated to the business of the insurance\r\ncompanies and not covered by the terms of the Windbrook \"loan.\"\r\nIn his closing argument, the prosecutor argued that this\r\nevidence, in the context of and in combination with other evidence,\r\ndemonstrated Reeder's knowing participation in the fraudulent\r\ndiversion of insurance company assets and his intent to defraud. \r\nSee, e.g., United States v. Woodward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198059\"><a href=\"/opinion/198059/united-states-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (1st Cir.\r\n1998) (violation of state law probative of intent to deceive in\r\nmail fraud case); see id. at 57 (\"The jury was entitled to infer\r\n[defendant's] intent from the circumstances surrounding his\r\nactions, from indirect, as opposed to direct, evidence.\")\r\n(quotation omitted); see also United States v. Tajeddini, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610547\"><a href=\"/opinion/610547/united-states-v-hojatollah-tajeddini/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1278</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1282 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"[T]he prosecutor is entitled, in\r\nclosing, to ask the jury to draw warrantable inferences from the\r\nevidence admitted during trial.\").\r\nThere is no reason to believe that the jury erroneously\r\nconcluded that it could convict simply because Reeder violated a\r\nregulatory order or breached a contract.  Defense counsel\r\nrepeatedly warned the jury that Reeder was \"not on trial for\r\nviolating a conditional order\" or \"for violation of a state\r\nstatute.\"  They further informed the jury that \"[t]his is not a\r\nbreach of contract case,\" and that the jury had to decide whether\r\nReeder \"knowingly and willfully obtain[ed] the money through deceit\r\nor fraud.\"  Furthermore, the trial court's instructions cured any\r\nalleged error in the closing argument.  The court correctly\r\ninstructed the jury on the elements of the offense for both the\r\nwire fraud and the ITSP counts.  The court specifically instructed\r\nthe jury that \"[t]he violation of an insurance regulatory order or\r\nstate law is not itself a federal crime.\"\r\nIII.  Variance\r\nReeder argues that the alleged theories of conviction\r\noffered by the prosecution in its closing argument varied from the\r\ntheory of conviction alleged in the indictment.  Specifically, he\r\ncontends that the government urged the jury to convict on what he\r\nterms \"non-fraud\" theories: (1) the admission that Reeder took $1\r\nmillion; (2) the failure to get a waiver for the Windbrook loan;\r\nand (3) the failure to comply with the contract terms.  He urges\r\nthis Court to reverse because these \"non-fraud\" theories of\r\nconviction varied from the theory of fraud charged in the\r\nindictment.  Reeder argues that his rights were substantially\r\naffected by the alleged variance because the jury was allowed to\r\nconvict on a theory insufficient to constitute the federal crime of\r\nwire fraud.  Reeder's variance argument is simply a restatement of\r\nhis claim that the jury may have convicted him on a legally\r\ninsufficient theory based on the government's closing argument. \r\nCouched in different terms, it is still unconvincing.\r\nA variance occurs when the proof at trial paints a\r\nportrait that differs materially from the scenario detailed in the\r\nindictment.  See United States v. Vavlitis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195045\"><a href=\"/opinion/195045/united-states-v-vavlitis/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 210 (1st\r\nCir. 1993).  A variance requires reversal of a conviction only if\r\nit is both material and prejudicial, for example, if the variance\r\nworks a substantial interference with the defendant's right to be\r\ninformed of the charges.  See Vavlitis, 9 F.3d at 210.  When, as\r\nhere, the indictment gives a defendant particular notice of the\r\nevents charged, and the proof at trial centers on those events,\r\nminor differences in the details of the facts charged, as\r\ncontrasted to those proved, are unlikely to be either material or\r\nprejudicial.\r\nThere was no variance between the evidence presented at\r\ntrial and the indictment.  The proof at trial is necessarily more\r\ndetailed than the facts alleged in the indictment, which is simply\r\na \"plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential\r\nfacts constituting the offense charged.\"  Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1). \r\nThe indictment charged a scheme to defraud encompassing the\r\nacquisition of insurance companies and the diversion of the\r\ncompanies' assets.  Paragraphs 28 to 44 of the Redacted Indictment\r\ndiscuss the fraudulent activity undertaken after the acquisition of\r\nthe insurance companies, and specifically refer to the Windbrook\r\nloan. See RI  36-38.  To the extent that: (1) the admission\r\nconcerning taking $1 million because of the amended release clause;\r\n(2) the failure to secure a waiver for the Windbrook loan; and (3)\r\nthe failure to comply with the Windbrook loan terms were not\r\nspecifically detailed in the indictment, these facts did not\r\nmaterially vary the nature of the charged fraudulent scheme.\r\nNo prejudice resulted because Reeder was not deprived \"of\r\nsufficiently specific information to prepare a defense, unfairly\r\nsurprise[d] . . . at trial, or isolate[d] . . . from the\r\nconstitutional protection against double jeopardy.\"  United States\r\nv.

Unanimity\r\nReeder argues that the district court erred in failing to\r\ninstruct the jurors that they had to unanimously agree on \"the\r\ntheories and acts of fraud\" underlying their guilty verdict.  We\r\nfind no such error.\r\nIn Schad v. Arizona, the Supreme Court held that, in\r\nreturning general verdicts in cases in which the government has\r\nalleged in a single count that the defendant committed the offense\r\nby one or more specified means, jurors are not required to agree\r\nupon a single means of commission.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112637\"><a href=\"/opinion/112637/schad-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631 (1991)\r\n(plurality opinion); id. at 649 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and\r\nconcurring in the judgment) (explaining that, for example, where \"a\r\nwoman's charred body has been found in a house, and there is ample\r\nevidence that the defendant set out to kill her,\" the jury does not\r\nhave to agree on whether defendant \"strangled victim to death,\" or\r\n\"left her unconscious and set the fire to kill her\").  While a jury\r\nmust agree on all of the elements of an offense, it need not agree\r\non the means by which all the elements were accomplished. \r\nHere, the jury was instructed that one of the elements of\r\nthe wire fraud counts was the defendant's knowing participation in\r\na scheme to defraud.  The government alleged and proved a single\r\nscheme to defraud.  While the jurors had to unanimously agree that\r\nReeder knowingly participated in a scheme to defraud -- an element\r\nof the crime -- they did not, contrary to Reeder's contention, have\r\nto unanimously agree on each piece of evidence offered to prove\r\nReeder's participation.\r\nV.  Attorney-Client Privilege\r\nAt trial, Reeder objected to the district court's\r\nadmission of Karma's testimony about his 1991 conversation with\r\nReeder, during which Reeder asked for Karma's help in covering up\r\nhis use of insurance company money.  The district court found that\r\nKarma's testimony was not protected by the attorney-client\r\nprivilege on two bases.  First, the court determined that the\r\nconversation was admissible under the crime-fraud exception to the\r\nattorney-client privilege.  Second, the court determined that\r\nReeder had waived the attorney-client privilege by failing to\r\nobject to Karma's extensive prior testimony about his\r\ncommunications with Reeder relating to the insurance company\r\ntransactions.  We agree with the district court that Reeder's \r\nconversation with Karma was admissible under the crime-fraud\r\nexception.\r\nThe importance and sanctity of the attorney-client\r\nprivilege is well established.

'I can get my friends to write new\r\ninvoices and we'll pay them as of 1988.'\"  Karma told Reeder that\r\nto do so would be asking 20-30 people to commit fraud, that he did\r\nnot want any part of it, and he advised Reeder not to do it. \r\nReeder then stated, \"I thought maybe you could come up with some\r\nidea.\"  Karma once again refused to help Reeder cover up the\r\ntransactions,  responding, \"Wayne, it's a crime.  I don't want\r\nanything to do with it.  Don't ever discuss it with me again.\"  The\r\ndistrict court's determination that the government made a prima\r\nfacie showing that Reeder solicited Karma's assistance to cover up\r\nhis criminal conduct was not an abuse of discretion.  Reeder sought\r\nKarma's services to enable him to commit what he knew or reasonably\r\nshould have known to be fraud.  See Rakes, 136 F.3d at 4.\r\nReeder argues that the crime-fraud exception does not\r\napply because he was simply asking Karma's advice about whether he\r\ncould solve a problem in a particular manner.  The record belies\r\nReeder's assertion.  Reeder did not merely ask Karma whether\r\nbackdating invoices would be illegal, which would be equivalent to\r\nReeder's hypothetical about \"the head of a corporation asking his\r\ncounsel if he can condition a campaign contribution to a politician\r\non the politician's promise to support legislation.\"  Here, Reeder\r\ntwice asked for Karma's help in a cover-up of Reeder's fraudulent\r\ndiversion of the insurance companies' money.  See Subpoenas, 144\r\nF.3d at 660 (\"The exception does not apply if the assistance is\r\nsought only to disclose past wrongdoing, . . . but it does apply if\r\nthe assistance was used to cover up and perpetuate the crime or\r\nfraud.\").  Therefore, the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in admitting Karma's testimony under the crime-fraud\r\nexception.\r\nBecause we hold that the conversation was admissible\r\nunder the crime-fraud exception, there is no need to reach the\r\nwaiver issue.\r\nVI.  Evidentiary Rulings\r\nReeder challenges several of the district court's\r\nevidentiary rulings. We review a district court's rulings on\r\nadmissibility and relevance for abuse of discretion.  See Cassiere,\r\n4 F.3d at 1018.  Under Fed. R. Evid. 403, relevant evidence may be\r\nexcluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the\r\njury.  This Court grants the trial court \"especially wide latitude\"\r\nwhen Rule 403 balancing is the subject of review.  See United\r\nStates v. Rivera-Gmez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705988\"><a href=\"/opinion/705988/united-states-v-luis-raul-rivera-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 996 (1st Cir. 1995).  \"[O]nly\r\nrarely -- and in extraordinary circumstances -- will we, from the\r\nvista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-\r\nthe-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative\r\nvalue and unfair effect.\"  Williams v. Drake, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198058\"><a href=\"/opinion/198058/williams-v-drake/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1st\r\nCir. 1998) (quotation omitted).\r\nFirst, Reeder argues that the district court erred in\r\nexcluding testimony from Karma and Reeder that the Windbrook loan\r\nwas restructured to substitute Resolute for Diamond as the payor. \r\nThe crime was completed when Reeder made the wire transfers in June\r\n1988, thereby diverting the insurance companies' funds for his own\r\npurposes.  Evidence of elaborate accounting transactions undertaken\r\nafter June 1988 to restructure the Windbrook loan are irrelevant to\r\nReeder's state of mind at the time that he misappropriated the\r\n$16.5 million.  In any event, any error in the exclusion was\r\nharmless because the district court allowed both Reeder and Ormand\r\nto testify that the Windbrook loan was rebooked as a loan from\r\nResolute.  See United States v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564957\"><a href=\"/opinion/564957/united-states-v-kenneth-michael-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1488 (1st\r\nCir. 1991) (any error in the exclusion of evidence is rendered\r\nharmless where \"defendant's theory . . . was manifested to the jury\r\nthrough testimony which was allowed\").\r\nSecond, Reeder challenges the district court's exclusion\r\nof notes taken by Bence, Karma's law partner, during a June 13,\r\n1988, conversation with Ormand, to the effect that Ormand did not\r\nthink that the Windbrook loan violated state insurance laws.  This\r\nevidence was inadmissible because Reeder failed to lay a proper\r\nevidentiary foundation.  Reeder sought to introduce this exhibit\r\nthrough Karma.  Karma testified, however, that he did not know what\r\nBence discussed with Ormand that day.  Reeder thus sought to\r\nintroduce \"Mr. Ormand's opinion as expressed to Mr. Bence as\r\nrecorded by Mr. Bence on a paper that's in this witness's [Karma's]\r\nfile,\" about a conversation that Karma had already testified he\r\nknew nothing about.  The district court suggested that the document\r\nmight be admissible through Ormand, that defense counsel could\r\noffer it through Bence, or that Reeder could testify about it. \r\nReeder did not pursue any of these avenues.  Consequently, the\r\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in determining that\r\nthis document could not be introduced through Karma.\r\nThird, Reeder argues that the district court erroneously\r\nexcluded evidence demonstrating that various people knew about the\r\nWindbrook loan.  Reeder sought to introduce through Durfee,\r\nAmerican's Chief Financial Officer, a letter that Durfee wrote to\r\nOrmand referring to the documents that were required in order to\r\nmake certain booking entries at American regarding the\r\nrestructuring of the Windbrook loan.  The government objected based\r\non relevance.  The court queried where the original documents\r\nsupporting the book entries referred to in the letter were, and\r\ndefense counsel stated that he did not have them.  The court then\r\nexcluded the exhibit on the basis that this evidence was \"secondary\r\nat best\" and explained, \"I think we need something a little\r\nbetter.\"  The court also stated, \"Certainly, you can ask this\r\nwitness if he has a recollection if this was recorded on the\r\nbooks.\"  Defense counsel failed to ask that question.  The district\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Reeder had failed\r\nto lay a proper foundation for the admissibility of the Durfee\r\nletter by failing to produce the documents that would support the\r\naccounting entries discussed in the letter.\r\nLater, Reeder sought testimony from Durfee as to whether\r\nthe Windbrook loan was restructured so that it became a receivable\r\nof Resolute rather than Diamond.  As discussed above, the district\r\ncourt did not exceed its discretion in determining that the\r\nrelevance of that testimony was substantially outweighed by the\r\nconfusion it would bring to the case.  Moreover, Durfee was allowed\r\nto testify that he was aware of the Windbrook loan and of the wire\r\ntransfers from Diamond's account at Fleet Bank, thereby supporting\r\nReeder's defense that many people were aware of the loan.\r\nOn re-cross examination of Ormand, Reeder sought to\r\nintroduce an August 9, 1988, letter Ormand sent to one of\r\nResolute's other lawyers that discussed some of the transactions\r\ninvolved in the restructuring of the Windbrook loan.  Ormand\r\ntestified that he did not know if a copy was mailed to Comey,\r\nDiamond's President, but that a copy \"probably was sent\" to her. \r\nComey had testified that she did not remember receiving the letter. \r\nThe district court sustained the government's objection that the\r\nletter was inadmissible hearsay and irrelevant.  Reeder argues that\r\nthis evidence would have demonstrated that Diamond executives were\r\naware of the restructuring, and would have refuted Comey's prior\r\ntestimony that she had difficulty obtaining information about the\r\nwhereabouts of the LACOP money.\r\nThe district court's ruling was proper.  First, the\r\ndocument was inadmissible hearsay with respect to the facts\r\ncontained within it.  Second, the document was not admissible to\r\nimpeach Comey, because Reeder failed to establish a proper\r\nfoundation that the letter was even sent to Comey, let alone\r\nwhether she received it.  Third, the district court's decision that\r\nthe evidence was outside the limited scope of a re-cross\r\nexamination was not an abuse of discretion.  Fourth, the district\r\ncourt's decision that evidence relating to the details of the\r\nrestructuring was irrelevant was not an abuse of discretion.\r\nFinally, Reeder sought to introduce notes Ormand took\r\nduring a March 1988 conversation with Susan Gallinger, Resolute's\r\nlocal counsel in Arizona, in which they discussed the feasibility\r\nof having Diamond purchase the liens.  The court properly sustained\r\nthe government's objection that the notes were inadmissible\r\nhearsay.  Reeder does not even attempt to argue that the district\r\ncourt's ruling was erroneous.  Nor does Reeder explain how this\r\nevidence was relevant to demonstrating that regulators or insurance\r\ncompany executives were aware of the Windbrook loan, or how the\r\nexclusion of this evidence affected his defense.  Thus, the\r\nevidence was properly excluded.\r\nContrary to Reeder's assertion, the district court's\r\nevidentiary rulings taken together did not amount to a Sixth\r\nAmendment violation eviscerating his defense.  Under the\r\nConstitution, a defendant \"does not have an unfettered right to\r\noffer [evidence] that is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise\r\ninadmissible under standard rules of evidence.\"  Montana v.Egelhoff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118043\"><a href=\"/opinion/118043/montana-v-egelhoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42 (1996) (quoting Taylor v.

The district\r\ncourt's rulings were proper and within its discretion.\r\nVII.  Sentencing Issues\r\nReeder was sentenced under Guideline  2F1.1 of the 1988\r\nSentencing Guidelines Manual.  His base offense level was 6.  The\r\ncourt imposed an 11-level upward adjustment because the amount of\r\nloss involved exceeded $5 million.  In imposing the upward\r\nadjustment, the district court found that the loss in this case was\r\n$16.5 million, the money Reeder had Christopher divert from the\r\nFleet Bank account for Reeder's benefit.  The court added two more\r\noffense levels because the offense involved more than minimal\r\nplanning or a scheme to defraud more than one victim, and imposed\r\na four-level role in the offense enhancement.  As a result,\r\nReeder's total offense level was determined to be 23.  Reeder was\r\nassigned to Criminal History Category I, resulting in a guidelines\r\nrange of 46-57 months.  The district court sentenced him to 46\r\nmonths of imprisonment.  Reeder argues that the district court: (1)\r\nincorrectly calculated the amount of the loss; and (2) incorrectly\r\nimposed a four-level role in the offense enhancement.  Neither\r\nargument is persuasive.\r\nA.  Loss calculation\r\nReeder challenges the district court's loss calculation.\r\nHe argues that the $16.5 million figure cannot be used in\r\ncalculating his offense level because the government argued in the\r\nChristopher case that Christopher alone was responsible for that\r\nloss.\r\nUnder the Guidelines, loss is the \"value of the property\r\ntaken.\"  U.S.S.G.  2B1.1 comment. 2 (1988) (cross-referenced from\r\n2F1.1)).  After adding 11 levels to Reeder's base offense level\r\nbecause the amount of loss exceeded $5 million, the court declined\r\nto grant a downward departure based on Reeder's argument that the\r\nloss amount overstated the seriousness of his offense because\r\nChristopher contributed to the loss.\r\n\"[T]he victim loss table in  U.S.S.G. 2F1.1(b)(1)\r\npresumes that the defendant alone is responsible for the entire\r\namount of victim loss specified in the particular loss range\r\nselected by the sentencing court.\"  United States v. Gregorio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577673\"><a href=\"/opinion/577673/united-states-v-william-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (1st Cir. 1992).  Any portion of the total loss\r\nsustained by the victim as a consequence of factors extraneous to\r\nthe defendant's criminal conduct is not deducted from total \"victim\r\nloss\" prior to the determination of the applicable guideline\r\nsentencing range pursuant to  U.S.S.G.  2F1.1(b)(1).  See id. at\r\n347 (\"victim loss\" table encapsulates \"heartland\" sentencing\r\nformula for reflecting approximate total \"victim loss\" in the\r\nguideline sentencing range).  Rather, whatever distortive effects\r\nextraneous causes may have had on the total \"victim loss\"\r\ncalculation may warrant a departure from the applicable guideline\r\nsentencing range.  See  U.S.S.G. 2F1.1, comment. (n. 10)\r\n(\"downward departure may be warranted\" where \"total dollar loss\r\nthat results from the offense may overstate its seriousness,\" which\r\n\"typically occur[s]\" when defendant's fraud \"is not the sole cause\r\nof the loss\"); United States v. Kopp, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 531 (3d Cir.\r\n1991) (\"To the extent actual loss had other, more proximate causes,\r\na discretionary downward departure -- but not a mandatory 'loss'\r\nadjustment -- might be appropriate.\").\r\nWe lack jurisdiction to review the district court's\r\ndecision not to depart downward under the long-standing rule that\r\n\"a criminal defendant cannot ground an appeal on a sentencing\r\ncourt's discretionary decision not to depart below the guideline\r\nsentencing range.\"  United States v. Pierro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195522\"><a href=\"/opinion/195522/united-states-v-pierro/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619 (1st\r\nCir. 1994), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1119</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995);  see generally,\r\nUnited States v. Tucker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533861\"><a href=\"/opinion/533861/united-states-v-forrest-s-tucker/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding\r\nthat the defendant may not appeal a district court's decision not\r\nto depart downward).\r\nReeder attempts to circumvent the limitations on this\r\nCourt's review of departure decisions by recasting his argument as\r\nan attack on the loss amount used in calculating the adjusted\r\noffense level.  This Court has clearly held, however, that \r\n\n[a]ny portion of the total loss sustained by\r\nthe victim as a consequence of factors\r\nextraneous to the defendant's criminal conduct\r\nis not deducted from total \"victim loss\" prior\r\nto the determination of the applicable\r\nguideline sentencing range . . . . Rather,\r\nwhatever distortive effects extraneous causes\r\nmay have had on the total \"victim loss\"\r\ncalculation may warrant a departure from the\r\napplicable [guideline range].\r\n\nUnited States v. Shattuck, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581517\"><a href=\"/opinion/581517/united-states-v-lewis-donald-shattuck/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1012</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1016-17 (1st Cir. 1992). \r\nThus, Reeder's argument that the district court erred in failing to\r\nconsider other causes, such as Christopher's participation, for the\r\nloss in calculating Reeder's adjusted offense level is incorrect as\r\na matter of law.\r\nSecond, Reeder argues that the loss amount attributed to\r\nhim should be offset by the property that was eventually forfeited\r\nto the insurance companies.  That contention is foreclosed by our\r\ndecision in Christopher.  As we stated there: \"To reduce the loss\r\nby the value of the foreclosed collateral . . . would double count:\r\nthe insurance companies were entitled to the protection of lien-\r\nfree collateral without having to reduce their own capital in order\r\nto pay off the liens.\"  Christopher, 142 F.3d at 55.  Thus,\r\nReeder's effort to distinguish himself from Christopher on the\r\nbasis that Reeder contributed properties to the companies is\r\nunavailing.  If not for Reeder's diversion of funds, the insurance\r\ncompanies would have the forfeited collateral and the $16.5\r\nmillion.  As the district court stated, \"What [Reeder] want[s] is\r\ncredit for what he left in the bank after he robbed it.\"     B.  Offense Enhancement\r\nReeder challenges the four-level enhancement for his role\r\nas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved (1)\r\nfive or more participants or (2) was otherwise extensive.  See \r\nU.S.S.G.  3B1.1(a).  Reeder contends only that he did not lead or\r\norganize five or more persons who were \"criminally responsible\" for\r\nthe offense.  He makes no argument that the criminal activity was\r\nnot \"otherwise extensive,\" the basis for the district court's\r\nenhancement.  United States v. Rostoff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196027\"><a href=\"/opinion/196027/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 413 (1st Cir.\r\n1995) (extensiveness prong does not depend on number of\r\nparticipants).  Reeder's assertion that Christopher was the true\r\nleader is irrelevant.  The district court found that Reeder had\r\nultimate control of Resolute, placed Christopher in charge of the\r\ninsurance companies, and directed the disposition of monies taken\r\nfrom the companies.  A careful review of the record leaves no doubt\r\nas to the extensiveness of the criminal enterprise.\r\n                  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm.\n</pre>",
