Pasfield, Environment and Natural Resources Division,\r\nAppellate Section, Lois J. Schiffer, Assistant Attorney General,\r\nand John McNeil, Regional Criminal Enforcement Counsel,\r\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, were on brief for the United\r\nStates.   \r\n\nMarch 5, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  This is an appeal from a sentence\r\nimposed under the Sentencing Guidelines, and the issues are\r\npeculiarly complicated.  Because the criminal charges at issue were\r\nresolved by a guilty plea, we draw the facts of the case primarily\r\nfrom the presentence report, the sentencing transcript and various\r\nother materials before the district court.  See United States v.\r\nGill, 99 F.3d 484, 485 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nIn March 1993, a Canadian company called City Sales, Inc.\r\n(\"City Sales\") began purchasing a chlorofluorocarbon called CFC-12,\r\npopularly known as freon, from a Canadian supplier and shipping it\r\nto commercial buyers in the United States.   City Sales was then\r\nowned and managed day-to-day by Larry J. LeBlanc, who was\r\nresponsible for negotiating the terms of the freon purchases in\r\nCanada and who directed City Sales employees to arrange for the\r\ntransportation of the freon into the United States. \r\nDuring the pertinent period, U.S. law prohibited the\r\nimportation of chlorofluorocarbons such as freon unless the\r\nimporter (in this case, City Sales) possessed an \"unexpended\r\nconsumption allowance\" for each kilogram of the chemical.  42\r\nU.S.C.  7671a(a); 40 C.F.R.  82.4.  The United States had\r\ninstituted restrictions on the importation of certain CFCs in 1990\r\npursuant to an international treaty (the Montreal Protocol) aimed\r\nat phasing out their production and consumption in the interest of\r\nglobal environmental protection.  See 42 U.S.C.  7671 et seq.; 40\r\nC.F.R.  82.1 et seq. \r\nSuspicious of LeBlanc's actions, Canadian authorities\r\nnotified LeBlanc in June 1993 that City Sales would not be granted\r\nadditional CFC-12 export permits until City Sales could prove that\r\nit or its U.S. customers had the consumption allowances required to\r\nconduct the freon transactions at issue. Nevertheless, LeBlanc\r\ninstructed his staff to continue selling freon to U.S. consumers,\r\nand according to the presentence report, LeBlanc sold more than\r\n$800,000 worth of freon to U.S. customers between September 1993\r\nand July 1994.  The United States also suffered excise tax losses, \r\n26 U.S.C.  4681, estimated to be more than half a million dollars,\r\non the freon thus imported.\r\nOn April 29, 1997, a federal grand jury indicted LeBlanc\r\non 21 counts.  Thereafter, pursuant to a plea agreement, LeBlanc\r\npled guilty to 8 counts of violating the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.\r\n7413(c)(1), for knowingly causing the importation of freon into\r\nthe United States without the required consumption allowances, and\r\nto 6 counts--covering 6 of the same 8 transactions--of violating 18\r\nU.S.C.  545, a customs statute, for knowingly bringing into the\r\nUnited States merchandise contrary to law.  The remaining counts,\r\ninvolving charges of false representations on customs documents and\r\na catch-all conspiracy count, were dismissed.\r\nThe federal probation office's presentence report, the \r\nprosecution, and the defendant each took a different view as to how\r\nLeBlanc's sentence should be computed.  At the sentencing, everyone\r\n(including the judge) agreed that the counts to which LeBlanc pled\r\nguilty should be \"grouped\" as \"closely related counts\" under\r\nU.S.S.G.  3D1.2.  We accept the conclusion as plausible on the\r\npresent facts  without independently endorsing it.  See SEC v.\r\nLehman Brothers, Inc., 157 F.3d 2, 5 (1st Cir. 1998). \r\nWhere all counts fall within a single group of closely\r\nrelated counts, the base offense level for the entire group is the\r\nhighest offense level applicable to any single count or, if the\r\noffense level is determined largely by an aggregate amount (e.g.,\r\ndrug quantity), by  the level determined after such aggregation. \r\nU.S.S.G.  3D1.3.  To make this determination requires a count-by-\r\ncount calculation.  At this point, two different guidelines\r\npresented themselves for consideration, LeBlanc having pled guilty\r\nto 14 counts comprising offenses under two different statutes.  \r\nEnvironmental violations fall under part Q of the\r\nguidelines, and two different part Q guidelines specifically refer\r\nto the Clean Air Act provision to which LeBlanc pled.  U.S.S.G. \r\n2Q1.2, 2Q1.3.  The former applies to mishandling or unlawfully\r\ntransporting \"hazardous or toxic substances\" and the latter to\r\nmishandling of other environmental pollutants.  No one has argued\r\nthat freon falls into the former category, so we pass by this\r\npossibility.  Under the latter guideline, the base offense level is\r\n6, subject to various possible upward adjustments (not based on\r\namount).\r\nThe other pertinent guideline is U.S.S.G.  2T3.1, which\r\nappears in the guidelines part T governing \"customs taxes\" and\r\nwhich applies to \"evading import duties or restrictions\r\n(smuggling)\"; its statutory cross references specifically include\r\n18 U.S.C.  545, to which LeBlanc pled.  This guideline bases the\r\noffense level primarily on the amount of the lost customs taxes\r\ninflicted as measured by a general tax loss table.  U.S.S.G. \r\n2T4.1.  However, because no duty was payable on the importation of\r\nfreon, LeBlanc's base offense level under the guideline would have\r\nbeen 4, for offenses where \"the tax loss did not exceed $100.\"\r\nAfter a two-day sentencing hearing, the district court\r\nconcluded that LeBlanc should be sentenced under the customs tax\r\nguideline and associated tax loss table based upon the amount of\r\nfederal excise taxes on freon that the U.S. producers avoided by\r\ndealing with LeBlanc.  See 26 U.S.C.  4681.  The probation\r\nofficer's report, whose figures are not challenged, stated that the\r\nfreon involved in the counts of conviction represented $546,000 in\r\nlost excise taxes and an offense level of 17 under the standard tax\r\ntable.  The government supported this approach, although it urged\r\nuse of a larger excise tax figure.\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, the district court relied\r\nupon application note 2 of the customs tax guideline, which reads\r\nin full:\r\nParticular attention should be given to those\r\nitems for which entry is prohibited, limited,\r\nor restricted.  Especially when such items are\r\nharmful or protective quotas are in effect,\r\nthe duties evaded on such items may not\r\nadequately reflect the harm to society or\r\nprotected industries resulting from their\r\nimportation.  In such instances, an upward\r\ndeparture may be warranted.  A sentence based\r\nupon an alternative measure of the \"duty\"\r\nevaded, such as the increase in market value\r\ndue to importation, or 25 percent of the\r\nitems' fair market value in the United States\r\nif the increase in market value due to\r\nimportation is not readily ascertainable,\r\nmight be considered.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.  2T3.1 app. note 2 (emphasis added).  Apparently viewing\r\nthe excise tax as an \"alternative measure\" specifically\r\ncontemplated by the application note, the district court declined\r\nthe government's request to label its assessment a \"departure.\"\r\nHaving set 17 as the base offense level, the court\r\nreduced the figure by 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility,\r\nU.S.S.G.  3E1.1(a), and refused the government's request to make\r\nan upward adjustment for LeBlanc's role in the offense.  The\r\nresulting offense level of 14 produced a guideline range of 15 to\r\n21 months in prison.  The court sentenced LeBlanc to 15 months\r\nimprisonment and a $28,000 fine.  LeBlanc now appeals, arguing\r\nprimarily (as he did below) that the environmental offense\r\nguideline should have been used to set his sentence.\r\nInterpretation of the guidelines presents issues of law\r\nsubject to plenary review.  See United States v. Lombard, 5 F.3d\r\n568, 569 (1st Cir. 1993).  In this case, we believe that the\r\ndistrict court was misled by the government and the probation\r\nofficer; their common initial resort to the customs guideline to\r\nset the adjusted offense level does not comport with the\r\nguidelines' provisions and sequences for calculating the offense\r\nlevel or departing from it.  Whether the district judge might yet\r\ncome out at the same place, after following the guidelines and\r\nconsciously exercising his discretion to depart, is a different\r\nmatter.\r\nWhere counts are grouped as closely related, the grouping\r\nrules are quite specific: the next step is to determine the highest \r\noffense level applicable to any one count among all of the counts\r\nthus grouped.  See U.S.S.G.  3D1.3(a).  For this purpose it is the\r\n(partly) adjusted offense level and not the base offense level that\r\ncontrols.  Id. app. note 1.  Here, the base offense level for each\r\nof the customs counts was 4 and no specific adjustment was\r\nproposed; the offense level for each of the environmental offense\r\ncounts was 6, even if no specific offense adjustments applied.  For\r\nthis reason alone, the environmental offense guidelines' offense\r\nlevel of 6  represented the controlling offense level, subject to\r\nremaining adjustments and possible departure.\r\nIn this case, there is a further and independent reason\r\nwhy this course was required.  Quite apart from the grouping rules,\r\nthe customs tax guideline itself--in the guideline and not the\r\ncommentary--contains the following cross reference: \"If the offense\r\ninvolves a contraband item covered by another offense guideline,\r\napply that offense guideline if the resulting offense level is\r\ngreater than that determined above [i.e., by the tax table or the\r\ndefault figure of 4].\"  U.S.S.G.  2T3.1(c).  A common meaning of\r\n\"contraband\" encompasses items \"imported into a country against its\r\nlaws.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 322 (6th ed. 1990); cf. Fine v. St.\r\nPaul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 567 F. Supp. 1252, 1255-57 (E.D. La.\r\n1983).\r\nThe district court may well have thought that the base  \r\noffense level of 17, reached under its \"alternative measure\"\r\napproach approved in application note 2 of the customs guideline,\r\nrepresented the proper comparison with the offense level 6 reached\r\nunder the environmental guideline.  But while application note 2 is\r\nsomewhat terse, its \"alternative measure\" language contemplates\r\nthat it be implemented by a departure  from the guideline, although\r\none expressly permitted by it (sometimes called a \"guided\r\ndeparture\").  A close reading of the application note (quoted\r\nabove) supports the government's concession that the \"alternative\r\nmeasure\" is to be achieved by a departure.  Thus, the controlling\r\noffense level after the grouping-rule computation was 6 under the\r\nenvironmental offense guideline, assuming no specific offense\r\nadjustment.\r\nBut why, someone might ask, should the comparison be made\r\nof offense levels before possible departures rather than afterward? \r\nThe short answer, but not the only one, is that the guidelines so\r\ninstruct.  This is explicit in the grouping guideline which\r\nprovides that, in determining the highest-level count, \"[t]he\r\n'offense level' for a count refers to the offense level from\r\nChapter Two after all adjustments from Parts A, B, and C of Chapter\r\nThree.\"  U.S.S.G.  3D1.3 app. note 1.  And, in the sequence of\r\nsteps prescribed for application of the guidelines, id.  1B1,\r\ndeparting (under part K of chapter 5) comes only at the very end of\r\nthe process after the offense level is established.\r\nThe longer answer is fundamental to the departure concept\r\nembodied in the guidelines.  The idea, simply put, is that the\r\nadjusted offense level and criminal history computed under the\r\nguidelines create a presumptive, deliberately narrow range or\r\nbaseline for the sentence; in the interest of equal treatment, most\r\ndefendants sharing these pertinent characteristics will get a\r\nsentence within the range.  And departures will have to be\r\nconsidered, justified, and subject to appeal as departures from\r\nthat baseline which otherwise must apply to offenses within the\r\n\"heartland\" represented by the prescribed guideline range.  SeeUnited States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 949-50 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nThe government has written an able brief in support of\r\nits view that the district judge properly resorted to the customs\r\nguideline at the outset and erred only in failing to call his\r\nultimate decision a departure.  But its technical parsing of the\r\nguidelines is not persuasive: it misreads the grouping rules (seenote 1, above); and it violates the directive that a prescribed\r\ncomparison of offense levels within the grouping rules or as\r\nbetween different guidelines means the initial adjusted offense\r\nlevels and not the levels computed after departure.  U.S.S.G. \r\n1B1, 3D1.3, app. note 1.\r\nThe government's broader argument is that it would be\r\nabsurd to punish LeBlanc under the environmental guideline based on\r\nan offense level of 6 when that guideline is not correlated with\r\nquantity and is ill-adapted to measuring the full range of harms\r\ncaused by LeBlanc's scheme.  But that is a possible reason for a\r\ndeparture (which might take the judge back to the tax table as a\r\nuseful analogy) and not a reason for bypassing the steps, or\r\ndistorting the concepts, that underlie the guidelines and must be\r\nfollowed uniformly in many different contexts.\r\nIn this case, a departure could readily be justified. \r\nEven if the customs and environmental offenses are grouped as\r\nclosely related, they fail to account at all for a third threat to\r\nthe public caused by LeBlanc's conduct:  namely, a loss of revenues\r\nthrough excise tax losses.  A departure on this ground is not an\r\nend-run around the remarkably lenient grouping rules.  The excise\r\ntax loss was not reflected at all in the offense level under either\r\nthe environmental offense guideline or the customs guideline.\r\nFurther, the environmental harm in this case itself may\r\nbe outside the heartland of its guideline, making it an \"atypical\"\r\ncase.  Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 49.  Unlike the ordinary\r\n\"mishandling\" of pollutants, for which 6 is the base offense level,\r\nLeBlanc's offense may have disrupted, if only at the margin, a\r\nmajor program designed to deal with a world-wide threat of\r\nstratospheric ozone depletion.  The problem is not the specific\r\nrelease of LeBlanc's freon--which might otherwise have occurred in\r\nCanada--but the tendency of such smuggling to undermine the\r\nincentive structure for American industry to switch to new, less\r\nthreatening substitutes.\r\nAs the government explained at LeBlanc's sentencing\r\nhearing, a flood of relatively inexpensive, black market freon in\r\nthe United States may have hampered the creation of markets for the\r\nmore expensive replacement products U.S. industry has developed. \r\nOf course, calibrating this harm is much more difficult than using\r\nthe tax loss table to measure the excise tax loss.  Departures are\r\ndiscretionary, and the district judge is free to depart solely to\r\ntake into account the fiscal loss which is easily calibrated and\r\nmore easily justified as a departure. \r\nLeBlanc has offered an ingenious reason for objecting to\r\nthe use of the tax loss table even as a measure of fiscal loss.  He\r\npoints out that the table is primarily directed to wilful tax\r\nevasion, which involves a scienter element that (put very loosely)\r\ninvolves a conscious effort to cheat the government on taxes.  SeeU.S.S.G.  2T1.1.  Indeed, the absence of such a motive led us to\r\nsustain a downward departure in a case where the applicable\r\nguideline literally called for use of the tax loss table.  United\r\nStates v. Brennick, 134 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 1998).  LeBlanc says\r\nthat there is no proof that he intended to evade, or assist others\r\nin evading, excise taxes at all.\r\nThis may be so, but the table is pertinent here merely to\r\nhelp the district court to measure a reasonable departure, if the\r\njudge wants to depart.  While LeBlanc may not have wilfully\r\nintended to deprive the government of taxes, his wilfulness in\r\nviolating the environmental statute seems apparent from June 1993\r\nonward; other lost excise taxes were disregarded (see note 2\r\nabove); and (as noted above) the tax table ignores other harm done\r\nby LeBlanc to the CFC regime that may well be outside the heartland\r\nof the environmental offense guideline.  On balance, the tax loss\r\ntable may be generous to LeBlanc, and its use here surely would not\r\nbe \"unreasonable.\"  18 U.S.C.  3742(f); Cali, 87 F.3d at 581.\r\nIn one sense, a remand may be a waste of time.  The\r\ndistrict judge obviously preferred the \"alternative measure\" that\r\nproduced after adjustment an offense level of 14; nothing obliged\r\nhim to adopt  it.  His preference may not be changed by calling it\r\na departure or by appreciating that, absent a departure, the\r\ngoverning offense level would effectively be computed under the\r\nenvironmental offense guideline.  The government claims that\r\nseveral district courts have used the excise tax calculation in\r\nfreon cases, and the government professes to endorse the general\r\napproach.\r\nNevertheless, the likelihood and lawfulness of a similar\r\nresult does not let us depart for the district judge.  The initial\r\ndecision to depart must be made by the district judge, appreciating\r\nthat a departure is what is involved.  Still, it may ward off a\r\nfurther useless appeal for us to repeat that on the present facts\r\na departure would be permissible and that a departure to an\r\nadjusted base offense level of 14 would not strike us as\r\nunreasonable, if the district judge chose to impose it.\r\nThe sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for re-\r\nsentencing in accordance with this opinion.\n",

This guideline bases the\r\noffense level primarily on the amount of the lost customs taxes\r\ninflicted as measured by a general tax loss table.  U.S.S.G. \r\n2T4.1.  However, because no duty was payable on the importation of\r\nfreon, LeBlanc's base offense level under the guideline would have\r\nbeen 4, for offenses where \"the tax loss did not exceed $100.\"\r\nAfter a two-day sentencing hearing, the district court\r\nconcluded that LeBlanc should be sentenced under the customs tax\r\nguideline and associated tax loss table based upon the amount of\r\nfederal excise taxes on freon that the U.S. producers avoided by\r\ndealing with LeBlanc.  See 26 U.S.C.  4681.  The probation\r\nofficer's report, whose figures are not challenged, stated that the\r\nfreon involved in the counts of conviction represented $546,000 in\r\nlost excise taxes and an offense level of 17 under the standard tax\r\ntable.  The government supported this approach, although it urged\r\nuse of a larger excise tax figure.\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, the district court relied\r\nupon application note 2 of the customs tax guideline, which reads\r\nin full:\r\nParticular attention should be given to those\r\nitems for which entry is prohibited, limited,\r\nor restricted.  Especially when such items are\r\nharmful or protective quotas are in effect,\r\nthe duties evaded on such items may not\r\nadequately reflect the harm to society or\r\nprotected industries resulting from their\r\nimportation.  In such instances, an upward\r\ndeparture may be warranted.  A sentence based\r\nupon an alternative measure of the \"duty\"\r\nevaded, such as the increase in market value\r\ndue to importation, or 25 percent of the\r\nitems' fair market value in the United States\r\nif the increase in market value due to\r\nimportation is not readily ascertainable,\r\nmight be considered.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.  2T3.1 app. note 2 (emphasis added).  Apparently viewing\r\nthe excise tax as an \"alternative measure\" specifically\r\ncontemplated by the application note, the district court declined\r\nthe government's request to label its assessment a \"departure.\"\r\nHaving set 17 as the base offense level, the court\r\nreduced the figure by 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility,\r\nU.S.S.G.  3E1.1(a), and refused the government's request to make\r\nan upward adjustment for LeBlanc's role in the offense.  The\r\nresulting offense level of 14 produced a guideline range of 15 to\r\n21 months in prison.  The court sentenced LeBlanc to 15 months\r\nimprisonment and a $28,000 fine.  LeBlanc now appeals, arguing\r\nprimarily (as he did below) that the environmental offense\r\nguideline should have been used to set his sentence.\r\nInterpretation of the guidelines presents issues of law\r\nsubject to plenary review.  See United States v. Lombard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194934\"><a href=\"/opinion/194934/united-states-v-lombardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569 (1st Cir. 1993).  In this case, we believe that the\r\ndistrict court was misled by the government and the probation\r\nofficer; their common initial resort to the customs guideline to\r\nset the adjusted offense level does not comport with the\r\nguidelines' provisions and sequences for calculating the offense\r\nlevel or departing from it.  Whether the district judge might yet\r\ncome out at the same place, after following the guidelines and\r\nconsciously exercising his discretion to depart, is a different\r\nmatter.\r\nWhere counts are grouped as closely related, the grouping\r\nrules are quite specific: the next step is to determine the highest \r\noffense level applicable to any one count among all of the counts\r\nthus grouped.  See U.S.S.G.  3D1.3(a).  For this purpose it is the\r\n(partly) adjusted offense level and not the base offense level that\r\ncontrols.  Id. app. note 1.  Here, the base offense level for each\r\nof the customs counts was 4 and no specific adjustment was\r\nproposed; the offense level for each of the environmental offense\r\ncounts was 6, even if no specific offense adjustments applied.  For\r\nthis reason alone, the environmental offense guidelines' offense\r\nlevel of 6  represented the controlling offense level, subject to\r\nremaining adjustments and possible departure.\r\nIn this case, there is a further and independent reason\r\nwhy this course was required.  Quite apart from the grouping rules,\r\nthe customs tax guideline itself--in the guideline and not the\r\ncommentary--contains the following cross reference: \"If the offense\r\ninvolves a contraband item covered by another offense guideline,\r\napply that offense guideline if the resulting offense level is\r\ngreater than that determined above [i.e., by the tax table or the\r\ndefault figure of 4].\"  U.S.S.G.  2T3.1(c).  A common meaning of\r\n\"contraband\" encompasses items \"imported into a country against its\r\nlaws.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 322 (6th ed. 1990); cf. Fine v. St.\r\nPaul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1252</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1255-57 (E.D. La.\r\n1983).\r\nThe district court may well have thought that the base  \r\noffense level of 17, reached under its \"alternative measure\"\r\napproach approved in application note 2 of the customs guideline,\r\nrepresented the proper comparison with the offense level 6 reached\r\nunder the environmental guideline.  But while application note 2 is\r\nsomewhat terse, its \"alternative measure\" language contemplates\r\nthat it be implemented by a departure  from the guideline, although\r\none expressly permitted by it (sometimes called a \"guided\r\ndeparture\").  A close reading of the application note (quoted\r\nabove) supports the government's concession that the \"alternative\r\nmeasure\" is to be achieved by a departure.  Thus, the controlling\r\noffense level after the grouping-rule computation was 6 under the\r\nenvironmental offense guideline, assuming no specific offense\r\nadjustment.\r\nBut why, someone might ask, should the comparison be made\r\nof offense levels before possible departures rather than afterward? \r\nThe short answer, but not the only one, is that the guidelines so\r\ninstruct.  This is explicit in the grouping guideline which\r\nprovides that, in determining the highest-level count, \"[t]he\r\n'offense level' for a count refers to the offense level from\r\nChapter Two after all adjustments from Parts A, B, and C of Chapter\r\nThree.\"  U.S.S.G.  3D1.3 app. note 1.  And, in the sequence of\r\nsteps prescribed for application of the guidelines, id.  1B1,\r\ndeparting (under part K of chapter 5) comes only at the very end of\r\nthe process after the offense level is established.\r\nThe longer answer is fundamental to the departure concept\r\nembodied in the guidelines.  The idea, simply put, is that the\r\nadjusted offense level and criminal history computed under the\r\nguidelines create a presumptive, deliberately narrow range or\r\nbaseline for the sentence; in the interest of equal treatment, most\r\ndefendants sharing these pertinent characteristics will get a\r\nsentence within the range.  And departures will have to be\r\nconsidered, justified, and subject to appeal as departures from\r\nthat baseline which otherwise must apply to offenses within the\r\n\"heartland\" represented by the prescribed guideline range.  SeeUnited States v. Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 949-50 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nThe government has written an able brief in support of\r\nits view that the district judge properly resorted to the customs\r\nguideline at the outset and erred only in failing to call his\r\nultimate decision a departure.  But its technical parsing of the\r\nguidelines is not persuasive: it misreads the grouping rules (seenote 1, above); and it violates the directive that a prescribed\r\ncomparison of offense levels within the grouping rules or as\r\nbetween different guidelines means the initial adjusted offense\r\nlevels and not the levels computed after departure.  U.S.S.G. \r\n1B1, 3D1.3, app. note 1.\r\nThe government's broader argument is that it would be\r\nabsurd to punish LeBlanc under the environmental guideline based on\r\nan offense level of 6 when that guideline is not correlated with\r\nquantity and is ill-adapted to measuring the full range of harms\r\ncaused by LeBlanc's scheme.  But that is a possible reason for a\r\ndeparture (which might take the judge back to the tax table as a\r\nuseful analogy) and not a reason for bypassing the steps, or\r\ndistorting the concepts, that underlie the guidelines and must be\r\nfollowed uniformly in many different contexts.\r\nIn this case, a departure could readily be justified. \r\nEven if the customs and environmental offenses are grouped as\r\nclosely related, they fail to account at all for a third threat to\r\nthe public caused by LeBlanc's conduct:  namely, a loss of revenues\r\nthrough excise tax losses.  A departure on this ground is not an\r\nend-run around the remarkably lenient grouping rules.  The excise\r\ntax loss was not reflected at all in the offense level under either\r\nthe environmental offense guideline or the customs guideline.\r\nFurther, the environmental harm in this case itself may\r\nbe outside the heartland of its guideline, making it an \"atypical\"\r\ncase.  Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 49.  Unlike the ordinary\r\n\"mishandling\" of pollutants, for which 6 is the base offense level,\r\nLeBlanc's offense may have disrupted, if only at the margin, a\r\nmajor program designed to deal with a world-wide threat of\r\nstratospheric ozone depletion.  The problem is not the specific\r\nrelease of LeBlanc's freon--which might otherwise have occurred in\r\nCanada--but the tendency of such smuggling to undermine the\r\nincentive structure for American industry to switch to new, less\r\nthreatening substitutes.\r\nAs the government explained at LeBlanc's sentencing\r\nhearing, a flood of relatively inexpensive, black market freon in\r\nthe United States may have hampered the creation of markets for the\r\nmore expensive replacement products U.S. industry has developed. \r\nOf course, calibrating this harm is much more difficult than using\r\nthe tax loss table to measure the excise tax loss.  Departures are\r\ndiscretionary, and the district judge is free to depart solely to\r\ntake into account the fiscal loss which is easily calibrated and\r\nmore easily justified as a departure. \r\nLeBlanc has offered an ingenious reason for objecting to\r\nthe use of the tax loss table even as a measure of fiscal loss.  He\r\npoints out that the table is primarily directed to wilful tax\r\nevasion, which involves a scienter element that (put very loosely)\r\ninvolves a conscious effort to cheat the government on taxes.  SeeU.S.S.G.  2T1.1.  Indeed, the absence of such a motive led us to\r\nsustain a downward departure in a case where the applicable\r\nguideline literally called for use of the tax loss table.  United\r\nStates v. Brennick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197736\"><a href=\"/opinion/197736/united-states-v-brennick/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (1st Cir. 1998).  LeBlanc says\r\nthat there is no proof that he intended to evade, or assist others\r\nin evading, excise taxes at all.\r\nThis may be so, but the table is pertinent here merely to\r\nhelp the district court to measure a reasonable departure, if the\r\njudge wants to depart.  While LeBlanc may not have wilfully\r\nintended to deprive the government of taxes, his wilfulness in\r\nviolating the environmental statute seems apparent from June 1993\r\nonward; other lost excise taxes were disregarded (see note 2\r\nabove); and (as noted above) the tax table ignores other harm done\r\nby LeBlanc to the CFC regime that may well be outside the heartland\r\nof the environmental offense guideline.  On balance, the tax loss\r\ntable may be generous to LeBlanc, and its use here surely would not\r\nbe \"unreasonable.\"  18 U.S.C.  3742(f); Cali, 87 F.3d at 581.\r\nIn one sense, a remand may be a waste of time.  The\r\ndistrict judge obviously preferred the \"alternative measure\" that\r\nproduced after adjustment an offense level of 14; nothing obliged\r\nhim to adopt  it.  His preference may not be changed by calling it\r\na departure or by appreciating that, absent a departure, the\r\ngoverning offense level would effectively be computed under the\r\nenvironmental offense guideline.  The government claims that\r\nseveral district courts have used the excise tax calculation in\r\nfreon cases, and the government professes to endorse the general\r\napproach.\r\nNevertheless, the likelihood and lawfulness of a similar\r\nresult does not let us depart for the district judge.  The initial\r\ndecision to depart must be made by the district judge, appreciating\r\nthat a departure is what is involved.  Still, it may ward off a\r\nfurther useless appeal for us to repeat that on the present facts\r\na departure would be permissible and that a departure to an\r\nadjusted base offense level of 14 would not strike us as\r\nunreasonable, if the district judge chose to impose it.\r\nThe sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for re-\r\nsentencing in accordance with this opinion.\n</pre>",
