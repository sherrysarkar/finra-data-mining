Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Michael Kevin Dupont on brief pro se.\r\n Nancy Ankers White, Special Assistant Attorney General, and\r\nDavid J. Rentsch, Counsel, Department of Correction, on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nJuly 15, 1998\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  In these consolidated appeals, Michael\r\nKevin DuPont appeals from the denial of preliminary injunction\r\nmotions he filed in two civil rights cases.  Having limited our\r\nconsideration to issues squarely presented to the district\r\ncourt and properly preserved for appellate consideration, we\r\naffirm for the following reasons.  \r\n          First, the appellate brief largely reasserts\r\narguments which were rejected by this court in a prior appeal. \r\nSee DuPont v. Dubois, 99 F.3d 1128, 1996 WL 649340 (1st Cir.\r\n1996) (unpublished per curiam).  We have found nothing in it\r\nwhich would cause us to revisit the conclusions reached in that\r\nappeal.\r\n          Second, in appeal No. 97-2134, the district judge\r\ndenied preliminary injunctive relief without prejudice,\r\napparently for procedural reasons (the motions had been filed\r\nbefore the complaint had been screened under 28 U.S.C.  1915A\r\nand before the defendants had been served).  On appeal, DuPont\r\nhas made no attempt to explain how the court's ruling\r\nconstituted an abuse of discretion or legal error, thereby\r\nwaiving his claims as to this appeal.  See Playboy Enterprises,\r\nInc. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Puerto Rico, 906 F.2d 25, 40 (1stCir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 959 (1990) (an issue not\r\nadequately raised in the appellate brief is waived) (citation\r\nomitted).  \r\n          Finally, the motions filed by DuPont, which were\r\nsummarily denied by the district court in appeal Nos. 97-1786\r\nand 97-1167, were conclusory and failed to show an entitlement\r\nto injunctive relief.  \"[A] preliminary injunction is an\r\nextraordinary remedy that may be granted only by a clear\r\ndemonstration by a plaintiff of the merits of such a request.\" \r\nSee 13 Moore's Fed. Prac.  65.20, at 65-29 (3d ed. 1998)\r\n(footnotes omitted).  Under the circumstances, the district\r\njudge did not abuse his discretion or commit legal error in\r\nsummarily denying the motions.  See Narragansett Indian Tribev. Guilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir. 1991)  (\"Unless a mistake\r\nof law or an abuse of discretion is made manifest, we will not\r\ndisturb the [denial of a preliminary injunction motion.]\")\r\n(quotation marks and citation omitted).  \r\n          Affirmed.\n",
