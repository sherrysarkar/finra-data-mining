Singer and Rudman &\nWinchell, LLC were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n    *Of the      Northern   District     of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f                           September 13, 2001\n\n\n            CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.           This appeal from\n\nadverse rulings in the district court concerns the sale of\n\neighty acres of undeveloped waterfront land in Lubec, Maine.\n\nOwned by plaintiff-appellant Merrill Kearney, the land was sold\n\nat auction on his behalf by defendant-appellee J.P. King Auction\n\nCompany (“King Auction”) on May 14, 1997.\n\n            The auction did not go well.        Only two bidders were\n\npresent and one withdrew when the price per acre rose to $100.\n\nThe remaining bidder offered $8,000, a hugely undervalued price\n\nby both parties’ estimates.     (Kearney, himself, had only several\n\nmonths earlier purchased the land for $90,000.)          Forced by the\n\nMaine Superior Court to convey the land for $8,000 to the bidder\n\nat the auction, Kearney sued King Auction alleging breach of\n\ncontract,    negligence,    breach   of   fiduciary    duty,   negligent\n\nmisrepresentation,    fraudulent        misrepresentation,      punitive\n\ndamages, negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress, and unfair trade practices.1\n\nThe district court entered summary judgment in favor of King\n\n\n\n    1  Suit was brought in United States District Court in the\nDistrict of Maine under diversity jurisdiction as King Auction\nis an Alabama corporation and Kearney a citizen of Maine.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fAuction on all counts but breach of fiduciary duty, negligent\n\ninfliction of emotional distress and unfair trade practices.\n\nPlaintiff now appeals from that ruling, but only with respect to\n\nhis claims of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation and\n\npunitive damages.   The breach of fiduciary duty claim was tried\n\nto the jury, which found for King Auction.2   Plaintiff appeals\n\nfrom that result, alleging error in the trial court’s exclusion\n\nof certain evidence.\n\n         We consider, first, the district court’s dismissal of\n\nclaims upon summary judgment, and second, the correctness of the\n\ndistrict court’s ruling excluding evidence at trial.   Discerning\n\nno error, we affirm in all respects.3\n\nI.       Factual Background4\n\n\n     2Before trial, Kearney had voluntarily dismissed his claim\nof unfair trade practices. At trial, the district court granted\nKing Auction’s motion for judgment as a matter of law on\nKearney’s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress,\na determination from which no appeal has been taken.\n     3Defendants filed a cross-appeal conditioned on this court\nreversing in some part the judgment of the district court. As\nwe affirm that judgment in all respects, defendants’ cross-\nappeal is moot.\n     4The facts described below are taken from the record before\nthe district court at summary judgment, which contained\nextensive deposition testimony and documentary evidence.      In\nPart III of this opinion, when we discuss the evidentiary ruling\nat trial, we do so in the context of further evidence admitted\nduring trial, which, in order to keep separate from the analysis\nof the evidence at summary judgment, we do not describe until\nPart III.\n\n                               -3-\n\f                     In February 1997, Kearney purchased eighty acres of\n\nundeveloped waterfront land in Lubec, Maine, for $90,000.                                    By\n\nhis own account, he had spent considerable time surveying the\n\nland       before          negotiating      from   $300,000,    the       original       asking\n\nprice,          to    the    final   sale     price    of    $90,000.           He   thereupon\n\nattempted             to    sell   the   land      himself    for    a    profit,       placing\n\nadvertisements in various national and international newspapers\n\nsuch       as    the       Wall    Street    Journal    and    the       Hong    Kong    Daily.\n\nShortly thereafter, Donald Long, a Canadian businessman and\n\nacquaintance of Kearney’s, offered to buy the eighty acres for\n\n$1.8 million.                The two men entered into an informal written\n\nagreement at the end of February 1997.5\n\n                     Before formalization of the deal between Long and\n\nKearney, Michael Keracher from King Auction called Kearney with\n\nan offer to evaluate the land.                         Keracher had seen Kearney’s\n\nadvertisement and thought King Auction could sell Kearney’s land\n\nfor him at a competitive price.                     During that first conversation,\n\nKearney told Keracher that he had an offer from Long for $1.8\n\nmillion, which hadn’t been “completely finalized.”                                      Kearney\n\ntestified that Keracher told him that “the property was just\n\n\n       5\n      The deal between Long and Kearney was that Long would pay\nKearney $200,000 Canadian as a down payment and would pay off\nthe balance overtime at seven percent interest. The date of the\nagreement was February 28, 1997 and was to be finalized on March\n8, 1997.\n\n                                                -4-\n\fworth a lot more money that what [Kearney] was getting out of\n\nit . . . .    He said, I will fly up right now . . . and look at\n\nit and I can give you an evaluation of what I think . . . .\n\n[I]t would be worth your while, because it isn’t going to cost\n\nyou anything for me to check it out . . . .”            Kearney testified\n\nthat he was inclined to show Keracher the land, but not before\n\nspeaking with Long.\n\n           Long did not insist that the agreement between him and\n\nKearney was binding to the extent of precluding Kearney from\n\nshowing Keracher the land.           Long did express his skepticism,\n\nhowever, with regard to Keracher’s offer to sell the land for\n\nmore than the $1.8 million Long had offered.            Kearney testified\n\nthat Long “wanted to know how anybody else could get so much\n\nmoney out of it, and he wanted to meet with him [Keracher].”              So\n\nKeracher flew up to Maine from Alabama a few days later to visit\n\nwith Kearney and Long and to see the eighty acres in Lubec.\n\n           Keracher spent no more than one hour on the property,\n\nwhich was covered with more than twenty inches of snow at the\n\ntime.    Keracher testified that he did not speak with local real\n\nestate   agents   or   visit   any    other   parcels   of   land    nearby.\n\nKearney testified that Keracher “mentioned numbers, three to ten\n\nmillion dollars for the property” and that “[Keracher] felt it\n\nwould bring a minimum of three million dollars.”                    Although\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fKearney fell short of testifying that he understood Keracher to\n\nbe guaranteeing an auction price of at least three million\n\ndollars, Kearney did say that Keracher “just said many, many\n\ntimes . . . I’m sure it would bring in three million dollars.”\n\nWhen Kearney was asked “did you believe that you were being\n\nguaranteed   that    he    would   get   a   price   like   that?”,   Kearney\n\nresponded, “I believed that he was going to get three million\n\ndollars or more out of it . . . .             I felt that, sure enough,\n\nthey [King Auction] were going to get me over -- if they were\n\ngoing to get me over 1.8 million that it would be my interest to\n\ngo   with   them.”        Long   testified    to     essentially    the   same\n\nstatement.    Long explained that although Keracher “would not\n\nguarantee it, . . . he said he would get a minimum of 3.5\n\n[million dollars], and he thought up to ten million dollars.”\n\n            After viewing the property, Kearney drove Keracher\n\nfurther north to Fredericton, in New Brunswick, Canada, to visit\n\nLong who was waiting for them in a Sheraton Hotel.                    Kearney\n\ndescribed the meeting in the hotel room during which Long asked\n\nKeracher how King Auction “could get so much money out of th[e]\n\nproperty.”      Both       Kearney   and      Long    describe     Keracher’s\n\nexplanation as being that King Auction drew “heavy hitters,”\n\npeople both Keracher and Long described as “Hollywood people”\n\nand “big movie stars . . . [who] like places like that that’s\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fisolated.”      The implication was that those “heavy hitters” would\n\nbid up the price of the land.                Long reiterated, however, that\n\neven though “[Keracher] was quite sure that he could get [$3-$10\n\nmillion] out of it . . . it was an auction, so – you know–.”\n\nAsked    if    Long    meant    that    he     understood    there    to   be    no\n\nguarantees, Long replied “Well, that was . . . my opinion.”\n\n              Keracher denied speaking to Kearney or to Long about\n\nthe dollar amount the land could bring at auction.                  He explained\n\nthat “[w]e never do that,” speaking to the King Auction policy\n\nthat forbids agents from evaluating the object to be auctioned.\n\n“That is one thing that we are told by King [Auction], by our\n\ncompany, you never mention value.              You can’t.”    Keracher did say\n\nthat he recalls telling both Long and Kearney that the land was\n\nunique because of its size and its location on the ocean.                        He\n\nsaid that he had “looked at materials, advertisements, other\n\nadvertisements for land for sale in Maine, and had only been\n\nable to come across smaller parcels, five acres, three acres,\n\ntwo acres, ten acres.           And [Kearney’s land] was unique in that\n\nrespect, that it was a larger parcel.                It was eighty acres of\n\nwhat    they   said    was     ocean   front    property.”      Keracher     also\n\ntestified that he told Kearney that                  King Auction had been\n\nsuccessful     in     selling    “premier      properties”   such    as    his   --\n\npremier properties being defined by King Auction as worth over\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fa million dollars -- and that King Auction sells such properties\n\non a regular basis.   Keracher gave Kearney a list of people who\n\nhad sold their property through King Auction in the past as\n\nreferences, encouraging Kearney to call them.\n\n            At the end of the meeting between Long, Kearney and\n\nKeracher, Long agreed to let Kearney out of their informal\n\ncontract.    Kearney and Keracher then drove to the Bangor, Maine\n\nairport to return Keracher to Alabama.       During that drive,\n\nKearney and Keracher discussed the details of the auction, in\n\nparticular, what kind of auction it would be and who would pay\n\nthe up-front costs.   Keracher estimated the cost of the auction\n\nand advertising would run around $40,000.    Kearney did not want\n\nto pay it all, and the two men discussed the possibility of\n\nsplitting the cost.    The two men also discussed the possibility\n\nof the auction being an absolute auction, an auction with a\n\nreserve, or an auction with a published reserve.        Keracher\n\ndescribed an auction with reserve as less risky because the\n\nseller “can either accept or reject the highest bid.”   Likewise,\n\nan auction with a published reserve announces in advance that\n\nthe seller is not going to sell the property for less than a\n\ncertain amount of dollars.   The absolute auction as described by\n\nKeracher to Kearney “attracts the most interest because people\n\nread that its going to sell without reserve . . . and you can\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fexpect to bring in more bidders, and because of more bidders\n\nyou’ll have more competition, and hopefully you’ll get . . . the\n\nmarket value of the property.”              The risks of the absolute\n\nauction described by Keracher to Kearney were that the seller\n\n“take[s] what it brings . . . no matter what [King Auction]\n\ndo[es],    no   matter   how    beautiful   a   brochure    [King   Auction]\n\nprint[s], no matter how many ads [King Auction] place[s], at\n\nsome point in time [the] property must stand on its own.                  It\n\nwill bring what it’s worth.”\n\n            By plaintiff’s own account, the drive to Bangor airport\n\ndid not resolve the details of the auction.                Both Kearney and\n\nKeracher testified that no final agreement had been reached.\n\nNot until further telephone calls and discussions regarding the\n\nabove mentioned decisions, did Kearney and Keracher agree that\n\nthey would split the cost of the auction and that the auction\n\nwould proceed as an absolute auction rather than one with a\n\nreserve.    Kearney did say that Keracher expressed his preference\n\nto proceed with an absolute auction, feeling that it would\n\nattract more bidders.          To the same end, Keracher testified that\n\nKearney “may have said . . . [that he was] not afraid of an\n\nabsolute auction.”6\n\n\n    6   Apparently, Kearney had described to Keracher two other\nproperty auctions he had attended, one that was cancelled before\nit started and another that did not result in a sale. It was at\n\n                                     -9-\n\f         After a month and a half of sending various copies of\n\nthe auction contract to each other, on April 17, 1997, Kearney\n\nsigned King Auction’s agreement, initialing every page.   Kearney\n\nsaid he did not read the contract “word for word, but I looked\n\nthrough it.”    Kearney explains that he did not read the contract\n\nthoroughly because he had confidence in Keracher – “I had a\n\nhundred percent trust in him . . . [he] was a professional, and\n\nhe was an expert in what he was doing.”\n\n         The contract specifies the duties of King Auction, such\n\nas to “prepare and distribute advertising and sales literature\n\nin a manner reasonably calculated to advise persons who might be\n\ninterested in the PROPERTY and the sale thereof” and to “prepare\n\na full-color, descriptive sales brochure with photographs of the\n\nproperty.”     The contract also contains a disclaimer that the\n\nseller, Kearney,\n\n         acknowledges and understands that neither\n         KING nor any of its agents, employees, or\n         representatives have guaranteed or promised\n         that the PROPERTY, in whole or in part,\n         shall produce a specific price or that a\n         certain minimum price will be bid at the\n         AUCTION. SELLER is not relying on KING for\n         advice on the following: legal; accounting;\n         taxes; or the laws, rules or regulations of\n         any government. This AGREEMENT contains the\n         entire understanding of the parties, and all\n         prior understandings and negotiations have\n         been merged herein. SELLER is not relying\n\n\nthe latter auction where he learned of the property at issue.\n\n                                -10-\n\f            upon any statements or representations made\n            by or on behalf of KING that are not\n            specifically set forth in this AGREEMENT.\n\n            In     fulfillment     of   its     duties,      King    Auction      then\n\nadvertised the auction in nation-wide newspapers and magazines,\n\nprepared    full-color       brochures,        and   mailed    several      thousand\n\nbrochures     to    people    on    their      mailing       list.        Keracher’s\n\nundisputed       deposition    testimony       was    that    approximately        130\n\npeople responded to the advertisements requesting brochures and\n\nfifty people responded after receiving those brochures.                             Of\n\nthose, between eight and twelve people paid twenty-five dollars\n\neach to receive full property information packages.                            None,\n\nhowever, showed up at the auction.\n\n            Only two people attended the auction to bid on the\n\nproperty.    At this point, Keracher alleges that he asked Kearney\n\nif he wanted to continue with the auction and Kearney said yes.\n\nKearney contends to the contrary, testifying that it was he who\n\nwanted to stop the auction but Keracher would not listen and\n\nproceeded anyway.          Kearney claims that at that point he felt\n\nthat King Auction failed to successfully advertise to attract\n\nbidders.     He said that he also felt that King Auction failed to\n\nhonor his wishes as his agent to stop the auction when only two\n\nbidders showed up.           When the auction started and one bidder\n\ndropped    out     after   the     price    per      acre   rose     to   $100,    the\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fauctioneer attempted to change the auction from absolute to\n\nreserve.     This attempt failed.       The first bidder, successfully\n\nbidding $8,000 for the property, sued Kearney in Maine Superior\n\nCourt winning a judgment that ordered Kearney to convey the\n\nland.\n\n            This lawsuit by Kearney against King Auction followed.\n\nAll other claims being disposed of prior to trial, the jury\n\ndecided only Kearney’s claim against King Auction for breach of\n\nfiduciary duty.       It found no such breach, apparently believing\n\nthat King Auction, despite holding the auction when only two\n\nbidders were present, nevertheless fulfilled its fiduciary duty\n\nto Kearney.       Judgment was entered for King Auction.\n\nII.     Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n            A.       Misrepresentation Claims\n\n            Kearney’s misrepresentation claims were premised on\n\nKeracher’s statements to him that (1) at auction Kearney’s\n\neighty acres in Lubec would sell for between $3 and $10 million,\n\nand   (2)   the    auction   would   attract   “heavy   hitters.” 7   The\n\n\n\n      7\n      Although Keracher disputes that he ever made these precise\nstatements, for purposes of summary judgment, we take the record\nin the light most favorable to the Kearney, the non-moving\nparty. New York State Dairy Foods, Inc. v. Northeast Dairy\nCompact Comm’n, 198 F.3d 1,3 (1st Cir. 1999).          Kearney’s\ntestimony, along with Long’s, allow us to comfortably conclude\nfor summary judgment purposes that a fact finder could find that\nthese statements were made as both of these men say they were.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fdefendants contend that these statements, assuming they were\n\nmade, are not actionable under Maine common law as they are not\n\nstatements of present fact but expressions about belief about\n\nand hope for the future.    Defendants further contend that the\n\nrecord at summary judgment fails to create a jury question as to\n\nKearney’s justifiable reliance on these statements to support\n\neither cause of action.8   Determining, as we do, that defendants\n\nare correct with regard to their first contention – that, as a\n\nmatter of Maine law, neither statements are of present fact,\n\nhence, not actionable under Maine law as misrepresentations – we\n\naffirm the district court’s judgment.9\n\n\n    8  Claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation,\nalthough obviously distinct, both require that the defendant\nhave made a false representation of present fact and that the\nplaintiff justifiably relied on the representation as true. As\nclaims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation share\nthese two elements, we do not distinguish the two for purposes\nof this appeal. We note, too, that the plaintiff in his brief\ncollapsed his analysis of the two misrepresentation claims for\nthe   same   reason.      For   the   elements   of   fraudulent\nmisrepresentation, see, e.g. Glynn v. Atlantic Seaboard Corp.,\n728 A.2d 117, 119 (Me. 1999)(citing Letellier v. Small, 400 A.2d\n371, 376 (Me. 1979)).         For the elements of negligent\nmisrepresentation, see, e.g., Bowers v. Allied Inv. Corp., 822\nF.Supp. 835, 839 (D. Me. 1993) (citing Diversified Foods, Inc.\nv. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 605 A.2d 609, 615 (Me. 1992)).\n    9  Plaintiff contends that we are barred from deciding this\nappeal on this ground because King failed to raise this argument\nbelow. The record at the district court shows, however, that\nthis argument was before the trial court and that it was at\nleast one basis of its ruling granting King’s motion for summary\njudgment.\n     With respect to the fraud claim, the district court ruled\n\n                               -13-\n\f         Last year, in Vielleux v. Nat’l Broadcasting Co., 206\n\nF.3d 92 (1st Cir. 2000), this court considered the evolving\n\nMaine common law of misrepresentation when the basis of the\n\nclaim is a statement that might be construed as an opinion or\n\npromise of future performance.\n\n         Traditionally, an action for deceit could be\n         brought under Maine law only if the\n         challenged misrepresentation was of past or\n         existing fact, not just of opinion or of\n         promises for future performance. See Wildes\n\n\nthat Kearney failed to proffer sufficient evidence from which a\nreasonable jury could find that King Auction recklessly\ndisregarded the truth of the above statements.     The district\ncourt said that although King Auction was wrong, “being wrong\ndoes not make its statements intentional misrepresentations. ...\nAdditionally, it is dubious whether Kearney could justifiably\nrely on King’s representations. See generally Eaton v. Sontag,\n387 A.2d 33, 37-9 (Me. 1978)(“dealer’s talk”).” Kearney v. J.P.\nKing Auction Co., Inc., No. 99-137-B, 2000 WL 761793, at *3 (D.\nMe. 2000, March 2, 2000)(some citations omitted). With respect\nto the negligence claim, the district court concluded that there\nwas no evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that\n“the information supplied was false or that Kearney could\nreasonably rely upon it.” Id. Both of these rulings were in\nresponse to substantially the same arguments raised on appeal by\nKing: that (1) the statements are nonactionable statements of\nopinion and (2) Kearney could not justifiably rely on either\nstatement.\n     Moreover, an appellate court is not constrained to affirm\non the grounds relied upon below.       See Mesnick v. General\nElectric Co., 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991) (“Since\nappellate review of a grant of summary judgment is plenary, the\ncourt of appeals, like the district court, must view the entire\nrecord in the light most hospitable to the party opposing\nsummary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that\nparty's favor . . . . An appellate panel is not restricted to\nthe district court's reasoning but can affirm a summary judgment\non   any  independently   sufficient   ground.”)(citations   and\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n                             -14-\n\f            v. Pens Unlimited Co., 389 A.2d 837, 840\n            (Me. 1978). Even “a preconceived intention\n            not to perform” was said to be incapable of\n            turning a breach of a promise . . . to do\n            something in the future into an action for\n            deceit. Shine v. Dodge, 130 Me. 440, 157 A.\n            318, 319 (Me. 1931).\n                   In the Wildes case, however, the Maine\n            Supreme Judicial Court pointed to a sentence\n            in Shine, supra, as broadening the blanket\n            rule.   Allowing a finding of deceit to be\n            based   on   a   disingenuous    promise   of\n            employment, the Wildes court quoted Shine:\n            “The relationship of the parties or the\n            opportunity afforded for investigation and\n            the reliance . . . may transform into an\n            averment of fact that which under ordinary\n            circumstances would be merely an expression\n            of opinion.”     389 A.2d at 840 (quoting\n            Shine, 157 A. at 318).\n\nVielleux,    206   F.3d    at    119-20.         This   court’s   conclusion    in\n\nVielleux    was    that    “in       appropriate    circumstances,       promises\n\nconcerning    future      performance       may    be   sufficiently     akin   to\n\naverments     of    fact        as     to   be     actionable     under    Maine\n\nmisrepresentation law.”          Id.    As the two statements at issue are\n\nboth statements about the hoped-for outcome of the auction,\n\ni.e., a future event at which Keracher arguably promised “heavy\n\nhitters” would be present and that the land would sell for\n\nbetween $3 and $10 million, the question is whether this case\n\npresents the “appropriate circumstance[]” in which Keracher’s\n\n“promises    concerning      [the      outcome     of   the   auction]    may   be\n\nsufficiently akin to averments of fact as to be actionable under\n\nMaine law,” id.        In other words, we must decide whether the\n\n                                        -15-\n\finteraction between Kearney and Keracher was such that Kearney\n\n“justifiably       understood        [Keracher’s      promises      of       future\n\nperformance] as being of fact and not mere opinion.”                     Wildes,\n\n389 A.2d at 840.\n\n            The Maine cases in which statements of opinion “have\n\nbeen justifiably understood as being of fact” have arisen under\n\ncircumstances in which the plaintiff is “at the mercy of the\n\ndefendant,” such as in employment situations where an employer,\n\nwith     full    knowledge     of     imminent       corporate      downsizing,\n\nnevertheless promises a position to a new salesperson.                       Id. at\n\n840-41.    See also Boivin v. Jones & Vining, Inc., 578 A.2d 187,\n\n188-89    (Me.    1990)   (upholding      a   jury    verdict    in    favor       of\n\nplaintiff-employee for misrepresentation claim the basis of\n\nwhich was defendant-employer’s promise of continued employment\n\nmade with knowledge that such continued employment was likely\n\nunfeasible).      We drew upon this reasoning in Veilleux as support\n\nfor upholding (in relevant part) a jury verdict in favor of\n\nplaintiffs’ claim for a misrepresentation where the plaintiffs\n\nwere not employees suing their employer over promises of further\n\nemployment,      but,   when   the    statements     were   made,     were    in   a\n\nsimilarly vulnerable position.\n\n            In Veilleux, the defendants were truck drivers who were\n\nbeing featured in a television news program and were promised by\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fthe   defendant    news    station      that,    among   other   things,    an\n\norganization antagonistic to their profession (Parents Against\n\nTired Truckers (PATT)), would not be included in the program.\n\nOne factor influencing this court’s conclusion that the jury\n\ncould reasonably construe that promise as an averment of present\n\nfact was that the news station’s statements concerned “aspects\n\nof the program within [its] exclusive control [and] upon which\n\n[plaintiff] reasonably could have relied.”               Veilleux, 206 F.3d\n\nat 120.   We went on to explain that “[the plaintiff] was not in\n\na position to know about, investigate or influence defendant’s\n\ninclusion of PATT in the program; he was ’at the mercy of the\n\ndefendant[s]’     with    regard   to    their    representations.”        Id.\n\n(citing Wildes, 389 A.2d at 840) (citations omitted).               Equally\n\nimportant, however, to this court’s conclusion in Veilleux that\n\nthe relevant statement was an actionable misrepresentation more\n\nclosely akin to an averment of present fact than of future\n\nperformance was that at the time the statement was made,\n\n          a jury could reasonably find . . . that the\n          defendants deliberately concealed from [one\n          plaintiff], at the time they told him that\n          PATT would not be included, the fact that\n          they had already filmed and recorded taped\n          comments highly critical of truckers from\n          PATT’s co-founders . . . in preparation for\n          use in the projected program . . . .    The\n          program was therefore already a work in\n          progress when the misrepresentation was\n          made. A promise not to include PATT and the\n          concealment of prior PATT filming can be\n\n                                     -17-\n\f            regarded under the rational of Wildes and\n            Boivin as pertaining to existing “facts”\n            rather than mere opinions or projections.\n            Accordingly, we do not think the fact that\n            defendants’   alleged   representation    to\n            exclude PATT also pertained to a time in the\n            future (i.e., when the completed program\n            would be aired) prevents it from being\n            actionable as a misrepresentation of fact\n            under recent Maine law.\n\nVeilleux, 206 F.3d at 120-21.\n\n            None   of     the   factors     present    in    Veilleux   --     a\n\ndefendant’s exclusive control over and deliberate concealment of\n\ncritical information -- which factors track those considered and\n\nrelied upon by Maine courts, are present in this case.                     With\n\nregard to the first statement about the market value of land to\n\nbe garnered at auction, the relationship between Kearney and\n\nKing Auction was not vulnerable or one-sided such that Kearney\n\ncould not undertake his own investigation into the market value\n\nof his property or the range of values of land sold by King at\n\nauction.     On the contrary, the evidence was undisputed that\n\nKeracher    encouraged     Kearney   to     inquire   into    King   Auction’s\n\nreferences, those presumably being individuals on behalf of whom\n\nKing   Auction     sold   premier    properties       and    individuals     who\n\npurchased such properties at auctions organized by King Auction.\n\nMoreover, Kearney had been to a couple of auctions himself and\n\nhad experience with evaluating, buying and selling land in\n\nMaine.     He, as much as King Auction, should have been able to\n\n                                     -18-\n\finvestigate whether or not the $3 to $10 million figure was a\n\nreasonable one for the price of waterfront land in Lubec, Maine.\n\nNor    was    there     any   evidence    that      Keracher      was   deliberately\n\nconcealing something from Kearney that would make Keracher’s\n\nestimate of $3 to $10 million more like an averment of present\n\nfact than of future aspirations.                    This statement is in stark\n\ncontrast to the one at issue in Veilleux where the promise not\n\nto include the PATT footage was made after that footage had\n\nalready been filmed.\n\n              As for the second statement about “heavy hitters”,\n\nthere is little evidence in the record tending to establish that\n\nKeracher was lying when he said that King Auction’s auctions\n\nattract “heavy hitters.”           Whereas plaintiff provided no evidence\n\nthat those “heavy hitters” did not exist or did not attend other\n\nKing    Auction       auctions,   it     is   undisputed     that       King   Auction\n\nprovided plaintiff a list of references of former clients and\n\nattendees, the relative wealth of which plaintiff could have\n\ninvestigated to assure himself of the truth of Keracher’s “heavy\n\nhitters” statement.             For ought that appears, King Auction’s\n\nother        auctions     had     attracted         “heavy       hitters”      however\n\nunsuccessful the later situation in Kearney’s case.                       To be sure,\n\nthe fact that Kearney’s own auction played to a total absence of\n\nthe    so-called      “heavy    hitters”      may    be   some    evidence     of   the\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\ffalsity of King Auction’s statement that its auctions drew\n\n“heavy hitters.”   Standing alone, however, it is not enough to\n\ncreate a jury question on the issue of misrepresentation.\n\n         Moreover, it is important to note that in stating that\n\nKing Auction’s auctions attract “heavy hitters,” Keracher did\n\nnot guarantee Kearney that those “heavy hitters” would show up\n\nat his auction.    A reasonable interpretation of the statement,\n\nespecially in light of the auction contract both parties signed\n\n(e.g., defining King Auction’s duty, in part, to “prepare and\n\ndistribute   advertising   and   sales   literature   in   a   manner\n\nreasonably calculated to advise persons who might be interested\n\nin the PROPERTY and the sale thereof”), is that King Auction’s\n\nclient list and reputation was such that its auctions could\n\nattract wealthy bidders who are prepared to pay a high price for\n\npremier properties.   It should have been obvious, however, from\n\nthe signed auction contract negotiated by both parties and the\n\nnature of voluntary auctions themselves, that King Auction had\n\nno real control over who chose to attend any of its auctions,\n\naside from doing its best to publicize the event and market the\n\nproperty, duties which Kearney failed to show that King Auction\n\ndid not fulfill.      On the contrary, the undisputed evidence\n\ndemonstrated that King Auction prepared and placed nation-wide\n\nadvertisements, printed and sent to individuals on its mailing\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\flist brochures describing the property, followed up with those\n\nindividuals      requesting      further      information   with    full-color\n\nbrochures.10       Plaintiff’s     only    counter-evidence     was    his   own\n\ndeposition testimony in which he states, without foundation,\n\nthat he felt that King Auction failed to successfully attract\n\nbidders.       This self-serving and conclusory statement of opinion\n\nhas no probative value as to the truth of Keracher’s statement\n\nthat    King    Auction’s    auctions      attract   “heavy   hitters”,      the\n\nquestion a jury was to have decided had the misrepresentation\n\nclaim survived.\n\n             In any event, both statements at issue here are akin\n\nto those in this court’s decision in Schott Motorcycle Supply,\n\nInc. v. American Honda Motor Co., 976 F.2d 58 (1st Cir. 1992) –\n\nstatements found to be nonactionable misrepresentations under\n\nMaine law.       In Schott, plaintiff, a motorcycle dealership, was\n\nallegedly      promised     by   the   defendant,    American      Honda   Motor\n\nCompany, that Honda Motor Company would remain just as committed\n\nto the motorcycle industry as it had in the past and that new\n\nHonda products and programs would cause an increase in Honda\n\nsales.      Allegedly relying on these assurances, plaintiff split\n\ninto two businesses, one exclusively selling Honda motorcycles,\n\n\n       10\n       That King Auction would retain a percentage of the price\nof the sale also suggested that it would have been against its\ninterest not to try to market the auction as best it could.\n\n                                       -21-\n\fand the other selling Harley Davidsons and golf carts.                      Within\n\nthree years, the business that was solely devoted to Honda\n\nmotorcycles        went    under,     due   in   whole    part,   contended      the\n\nplaintiff, to the defendant’s false assurances of continued\n\nproduct development and commitment.                This court, citing Boivin\n\nand Shine, supra, affirmed the district court’s dismissal of\n\nplaintiff’s fraud claim that was based on the above statements\n\nbecause      the    “alleged      misrepresentations       consisted      only    of\n\nopinions as to future events . . . .                These general statements\n\nin   the   context        of   the    franchisor-franchisee       communications\n\nconstitute nothing more than ’puffing’ or ’trade talk,’ upon\n\nwhich no reasonable person would rely.”                  Schott, 976 F.2d at 65\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n             Like the statements in Schott, the statements at issue\n\nhere   are    no    more       than   averments    of    the   defendants’    high\n\nexpectations       for     the   auction    King   Auction     was   to   oversee.\n\nIndeed, the district court, in ruling for the defendants on this\n\nissue, cited to Sontag v. Eaton, 387 A.2d 33 (Me. 1978), a case\n\nthat merely reaffirms what is black letter law in Maine:                      that\n\na statement made by a seller of land regarding its estimated\n\nvalue is “dealer’s talk” and cannot be actionable fraud should\n\nthe market price of the land be in actuality much lower.                         See\n\nid. at 37 (“[M]isrepresentations as to value and quality of land\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fmade by the vendor, even though made with fraudulent intent, are\n\nnot   actionable      .   .   .   .    Such   representations    are   ’dealer’s\n\ntalk.’”).      Although King Auction was not the owner of the land\n\nto be sold, King Auction was “selling” the benefits of its\n\nservices on the basis of the perceived quality of Kearney’s land\n\nand its expertise in the auction process.                As a businessman who\n\nsells   land    at    auction,        Keracher’s    statements   regarding   the\n\npotential “heavy hitters” at auction and the land’s hoped-for\n\nsale price of $3 to $10 million\n\n            should have been understood [by Kearney] to\n            be[] but the use of extravagant language of\n            the class known to every man of ordinary\n            experience as “dealer’s talk,” i.e., “that\n            picturesque and laudatory style affected by\n            nearly every trader in setting forth the\n            attractive qualities of the goods he offers\n            for sale,” and this even among friends. But\n            such is not actionable. The law recognizes\n            the   fact  that   sellers   may   naturally\n            overstate the value and quality of the\n            articles of property which they have to\n            sell. Everybody knows this, and a buyer has\n            no right to rely on such statements.\n\nId. at 37-38 (citations omitted).               See also id. at 38 (stating\n\nthat “[s]ince an express statement by the Eatons that their\n\nproperty    was      worth    eighty     thousand    ($80,000)   dollars,    the\n\nselling price, . . . would not be actionable fraud, but merely\n\nan opinion of the sellers which the buyers must expect to be\n\nlikely inflated as puffing or dealer’s talk, their failure to\n\ndisclose the alleged fact, if true, that the actual investments\n\n                                         -23-\n\fin the property did not reflect the true value of the property\n\nwould also not be actionable fraud”).\n\n               We    conclude,       therefore,    that     no     action     for\n\nmisrepresentation            lies     under    Maine      law     under     these\n\ncircumstances.         Summary judgment for the defendants on counts\n\nfour        (negligent      misrepresentation)     and     five     (fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation) was properly granted.\n\n               B.      Punitive Damages\n\n               As plaintiff had no viable misrepresentation claim,\n\nsupra,       his    claim   for     punitive   damages    for    those    alleged\n\nmisrepresentations also fails.11\n\nIII.         Evidentiary Ruling at Trial\n\n               During trial on plaintiff’s remaining claim for breach\n\nof fiduciary duty, plaintiff asked to introduce evidence of the\n\ntwo statements that were the basis of his previously dismissed\n\nmisrepresentation claims.              The trial court, questioning the\n\nrelevance of the statements to the claim the jury had to decide\n\n\n\n       11 In any case, the evidence before the district court at\nthe time of its summary judgment ruling fails to meet Maine’s\nmalice standard for punitive damages.     “Maine law requires a\nplaintiff to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendant was motived by ’ill will’ toward the plaintiff, or\nacted so ’outrageously’ that malice could be inferred.”\nVeilleux, 206 F.3d at 135 (citing Tuttle v. Raymond, 494 A.2d\n1353, 1361 (Me. 1985)).     See also Boivin (reversing a jury\nverdict for punitive damages despite upholding the jury finding\nfor fraud based on false assurances of future employment).\n\n                                        -24-\n\f(breach of fiduciary duty), ordered arguments and proffers on\n\nthe relevance issue for the following morning before the jury\n\nwas to be brought in.\n\n           Plaintiff’s    position     was    that    the   statements   were\n\nrelevant to the breach of fiduciary duty claim because they were\n\nmade during the scope of the agency relationship and, as he\n\ncontended they were false or misleading, they bore on the issue\n\nof whether Keracher breached his fiduciary duty to Kearney. 12\n\nDefendants’ position was that the statements were not relevant\n\nbecause    they   could   not   have   been    made    during   the   agency\n\nrelationship as they were undisputably made on the first day\n\nKearney and Keracher met and therefore before any fiduciary duty\n\narose.13   When the court pressed the plaintiff to substantiate\n\nhis position that the agency relationship between Kearney and\n\n\n     12Presumably, plaintiff relies here on a fiduciary’s duty\nof good faith and, in some instances, material disclosure. See,\ne.g., Glynn v. Atlantic Seaboard Corp., 728 A.2d 117 (Me.\n1999)(in case alleging, among other things, corporate fraud\namong officers, stating that “[w]here a fiduciary relationship\nexists between the parties, omission by silence may constitute\nthe supplying of false information”)(quotation marks omitted);\nEstate of Whitlock, 615 A.2d 1173, 1178 (Me. 1992)(in a case\nalleging fraud on the part of a trustee of an estate, stating\n\"[t]h[e] duty to make full disclosure and otherwise to exhibit\nextreme good faith runs through the whole law of fiduciary and\nconfidential relations ...\")(citing George G. Bogert, Trusts and\nTrustees § 544, at 407-08 (2d ed. 1978)).\n     13 This position was in addition to defendants’ assertion\nthat the statements, assuming they were made, were not false or\nmisleading.\n\n                                  -25-\n\fKing Auction began on the very first day Kearney met Keracher,\n\nplaintiff explained “that [a] fiduciary relationship is not a\n\nlightning bolt.        It’s more analogous to a web that’s being\n\nwoven.    And the web began when these gentlemen met and continued\n\nand was reenforced and developed until it matured on May 14 [the\n\ndate of the auction].      That is our position.”\n\n            The court continued to be perplexed by plaintiff’s\n\nposition regarding the statements’ relevancy, and asked the\n\nplaintiff    directly:     “when    is    the    first   manifestation   of\n\nagreement between King [Auction] and Kearney that there will be\n\nan auction and a relationship?”           To this, plaintiff’s counsel\n\nresponded:    “I would represent to you that in . . . the car as\n\nMr. Kearney drives back from Fredericton to Bangor to drop Mr.\n\nKeracher off at the airport, he will indicate to you that at\n\nthat time he had decided that it was — the property was going to\n\nbe auctioned and he and Mr. Keracher discussed the methodology\n\nof the auction . . . .      That’s why the conversations progressed\n\nthat far, because there had been an agreement in the course of\n\nthat car ride . . . .”       Having heard this apparent concession\n\nfrom     plaintiff’s    counsel    that    the    earliest    the   agency\n\nrelationship began was on the way from Canada to the Maine\n\nairport, the court then asked counsel when the statements were\n\nmade, to which he responded “A very precise question, and I have\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fto give you a precise answer.           We’re at the other end of the car\n\nride.   They’re before you get to Bangor.            They are part of what\n\nleads up to coming down to Bangor.”\n\n            Having   received     this    apparent    concession      that   the\n\nstatements at issue were made before an agency relationship\n\nbetween Kearney and King Auction had formed, the district court\n\nruled the statements irrelevant and inadmissible, stating that\n\n“the fiduciary obligation flows from the agency relationship.\n\nThat is not established until there is an agreement, whether it\n\nbe written or oral.         I understand what [plaintiff’s counsel] is\n\nproposing.    But these are matters that go to the inducement, the\n\nentering into the [agency] agreement.               They have already been\n\nruled upon in the summary judgment context.                   The questions\n\nbefore the jury will be breach of the fiduciary obligations that\n\nflow from the auction agency relationship.”                  In essence, the\n\ncourt concluded that without an agency relationship to create a\n\nfiduciary    duty    at   the   time    the   statements     were    made,   the\n\nstatements    were    not    relevant    to   any   breach    of    that   duty.\n\nBecause we can find no error, let alone reversible error, in\n\nthis reasoning, we affirm the district court’s exclusionary\n\nruling.\n\n            Implicit in the district court’s exclusionary ruling\n\nwas the court’s acceptance of the factual predicate that the\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\fagency relationship between the parties had not commenced until\n\nafter the statements were made.14         This factual predicate is not\n\nonly supported by plaintiff’s counsel’s concession at trial, it\n\nis independently supported elsewhere in the record.            Viewed as\n\na factual finding, it was not clearly erroneous.15         Kearney’s and\n\nLong’s    deposition   testimony    indicated     that   the   statements\n\nregarding the estimated value of land and King Auction’s “heavy\n\nhitters” were made just after Keracher had viewed the property\n\nand once again during the meeting with Mr. Long.          This coincides\n\nwith plaintiff’s concession at trial that the statements were\n\nmade before Keracher returned to Bangor to fly home, before, as\n\nplaintiff    also   concedes,   any       fiduciary   relationship    was\n\nmanifested between the parties.           It was, therefore, manifestly\n\nreasonable for the district court to find that the statements\n\n\n\n\n     14The parties devoted considerable time in the district\ncourt arguing about when precisely the fiduciary duty between\nKearney and King Auction arose. King Auction argued that the\nfiduciary relationship began only with the signing of the agency\ncontract.   Plaintiff argued that the fiduciary relationship\nbegan much earlier, sometime in the car ride back to Bangor.\nThe district court did not resolve the dispute, and neither do\nwe, because even if the relationship began during the ride back\nto Bangor, the statements sought to be admitted into evidence\nwere made before that relationship arose.\n     15We review preliminary findings of fact that form the\nbasis of evidentiary rulings for clear error. Baker v. Dalkon\nSheild Claimants Trust, 156 F.3d 248, 252 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n                                   -28-\n\fwere made prior to the beginning of the parties’ fiduciary\n\nrelationship.\n\n         This being so, the only remaining question is whether\n\nthese statements were nonetheless relevant to the breach of\n\nfiduciary duty claim even though made before the fiduciary\n\nrelationship began.       In ruling they were not relevant, the\n\ndistrict court said:       “[T]hese are matters that go to the\n\ninducement . . . [and] [t]hey have already been ruled upon in\n\nthe summary judgment context.”         In effect, the district court\n\nconcluded that plaintiff was impermissibly seeking to revive his\n\nmisrepresentation    claims,     claims   that    the   district   court\n\npreviously   (and,   as   we   have   already    concluded,   correctly)\n\ndismissed.   Plaintiff made no argument in the district court to\n\nrefute the court’s conclusion along these lines,              e.g., that\n\nthese statements were relevant, if at all, only to the dismissed\n\nmisrepresentation claims and not to the fiduciary duty claim.\n\nWe discern no abuse of discretion in this ruling.          Iacobucci v.\n\nBoulter, 193 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 1999) (standard of review).16\n\n\n    16 In any case, an erroneous evidentiary ruling requires\nvacation of a jury verdict (the remedy sought here) only if the\nruling excludes evidence and “the exclusion results in actual\nprejudice because it had a substantial and injurious effect or\ninfluence in determining the jury's verdict.” United States v.\nShay, 57 F.3d 126, 134 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Neither party has argued, one way or the other, that\nthe ruling had such a “substantial or injurious effect” on the\njury verdict. We eschew any such argument on their behalf.\n\n                                  -29-\n\f              Plaintiff raises for the first time on appeal a legal\n\ntheory   as    to   why   the    statements    could    be   relevant   to   the\n\nfiduciary duty claim.           He contends that even if the statements\n\nwere   not     actionable       misrepresentations      when   made,    once   a\n\nfiduciary duty was established and King Auction had reason to\n\nknow that Kearney was laboring under the misconception that his\n\nland would fetch $3 to $10 million at auction, King Auction had\n\na duty as Kearney’s agent to correct Kearney’s mislaid high-\n\nhopes.   Plaintiff bases this argument on the proposition that,\n\nas his fiduciary, King Auction (via Keracher) is obligated to\n\nfully disclose “all facts within [its] knowledge which bear\n\nmaterially upon [Kearney’s] interests.”                Goldberg Realty Group\n\nv. Weinstein, 669 A.2d 187, 190 (Me. 1996) (citing Jensen v.\n\nSnow, 131 A. 415, 418 (1933)).               This rule commonly arises in\n\nMaine law with regard to the sale of land by a seller’s agent.\n\n\n\n              The rule is premised on the fact that a real\n              estate agent is not hired simply to locate a\n              buyer, but to so do as the seller’s\n              fiduciary. . . .   There is no requirement\n              that the principal prove fraud or malice on\n              the part of the agent or that the principal\n              show actual harm caused by breach of the\n              agent’s   duty.      In  a   case   alleging\n              nondisclosure, . . . the only questions are\n              whether the information was material and\n              whether it was withheld by the fiduciary.\n              The rule encourages fiduciaries to avoid\n              temptation altogether by forcing full and\n              frank disclosures.\n\n                                      -30-\n\fId. (quotation marks omitted).17\n\n            Plaintiff can secure no benefit from this Maine common\n\nlaw rule.     Because the appellant never raised this theory of\n\nrelevance in the district court, he is precluded from presenting\n\nit for the first time on appeal.            See McCoy v. Massachusetts\n\nInstitute of Technology, 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 1991).             See\n\nalso Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec.\n\nCo., 840 F.2d 985, 990 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating that a party has\n\na   duty     “to   spell     out     its     arguments     squarely   and\n\ndistinctly . . . [rather than being] allowed to defeat ths\n\nsystem      by     seeding     the         record   with      mysterious\n\nreferences . . . hoping to set the stage for an ambush should\n\nthe ensuing ruling fail to suit”).           This sound rule of waiver\n\nprotects district courts from having to second-guess and read\n\nbetween the lines of the briefing presented to it by opposing\n\nparties.    As we have said, “[o]verburdened trial judges cannot\n\n\n\n\n    17 Although we affirm the jury verdict for King Auction, we\nnote that under Maine law the only apparent remedy for breach of\nfiduciary duty in this context would appear to be the return of\nthe broker’s commission, here some small percentage of the\n$8,000 for which the land sold. See Goldberg Realty Group, 669\nA.2d at 190 (reaffirming previous holding “that the broker\nforfeits any right to a commission if he breaches [fiduciary]\nduty” of material disclosure).\n\n                                   -31-\n\fbe expected to be mind readers.”    Id.18   Plaintiff’s waiver ends\n\nthe matter.19\n\n\n     18Plaintiff confuses this waiver principle with the rule\nallowing the court of appeals to affirm a district court’s\ngranting of summary judgment on a different basis than that\nrelied on below.      The former prevents an appellant from\noverturning the district court on the basis of an argument never\npresented to the district court, furthering considerations of\njudicial economy and basic fairness; the latter furthers the\nsame goals and reaffirms the long-standing Supreme Court\nprecedent that “[w]here the decision below is correct[,] it must\nbe affirmed by the appellate court though the lower tribunal\ngave a wrong reason for its action.” Riley Co. v. Commissioner,\n311 U.S. 55, 59 (1940)(citing Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U.S. 238,\n245 (1937)(“In the review of judicial proceedings the rule is\nsettled that, if the decision below is correct, it must be\naffirmed, although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or\ngave a wrong reason.”)). See also Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 822 (“An\nappellate panel is not restricted to the district court’s\nreasoning but can affirm a summary judgment on any independently\nsufficient ground.”); Chongris v. Board of Appeals, 811 F.2d 36,\n37 n. 1 (1st Cir. 1987)(citing “ample precedent [in this\ncircuit] for this sort of fluctuation”).\n     19We note, however, without deciding the issue, that even\nif there was no waiver here, it is by no means certain that\nplaintiff would prevail were we to reach the merits of his\nrelevancy argument.   For one thing, it is not clear that the\nMaine common law rule on which plaintiff relies applies equally\nin the present context as it does in the seller-real estate\nagent context.    For another thing, the statements’ relevance\ndepends upon a strained interpretation of Keracher’s deposition\ntestimony in which he says “I told Mr. Kearney, and would tell\nhim again, especially as we got nearer to the auction, if he\nwanted to sell this property to anyone for $1.8 million, I would\nsay do it, because ... our company would be paid a commission.”\n Far from suggesting (as plaintiff urges it does) that Keracher\nhad failed to accurately apprise Kearney of material information\nregarding the potential sale price of his land, this statement\ntends to suggest that Keracher, in performing his fiduciary\nduty, strove to counsel Kearney in such as way as to comport\nwith Kearney’s wishes and interests.     Finally, as we stated,\nsupra note 16, even assuming the district court erred in\n\n                             -32-\n\f          Finding no error in the district court’s exclusionary\n\nruling,   the   verdict   is   therefore   affirmed.   Defendants’\n\nconditional cross-appeal is dismissed as moot.\n\n\n\n\nexcluding the statements as irrelevant, plaintiff is faced with\nthe further hurdle of showing that excluding the evidence\nresulted in “actual prejudice because it had a substantial and\ninjurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s\nverdict.”   Shay, 57 F.3d at 134 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Plaintiff has failed to argue for, let alone make, a\nshowing of actual prejudice.\n\n                                -33-\n\f",

This appeal from\n\nadverse rulings in the district court concerns the sale of\n\neighty acres of undeveloped waterfront land in Lubec, Maine.\n\nOwned by plaintiff-appellant Merrill Kearney, the land was sold\n\nat auction on his behalf by defendant-appellee J.P. King Auction\n\nCompany (“King Auction”) on May 14, 1997.\n\n            The auction did not go well.        Only two bidders were\n\npresent and one withdrew when the price per acre rose to $100.\n\nThe remaining bidder offered $8,000, a hugely undervalued price\n\nby both parties’ estimates.     (Kearney, himself, had only several\n\nmonths earlier purchased the land for $90,000.)          Forced by the\n\nMaine Superior Court to convey the land for $8,000 to the bidder\n\nat the auction, Kearney sued King Auction alleging breach of\n\ncontract,    negligence,    breach   of   fiduciary    duty,   negligent\n\nmisrepresentation,    fraudulent        misrepresentation,      punitive\n\ndamages, negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress, and unfair trade practices.1\n\nThe district court entered summary judgment in favor of King\n\n\n\n    1  Suit was brought in United States District Court in the\nDistrict of Maine under diversity jurisdiction as King Auction\nis an Alabama corporation and Kearney a citizen of Maine.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fAuction on all counts but breach of fiduciary duty, negligent\n\ninfliction of emotional distress and unfair trade practices.\n\nPlaintiff now appeals from that ruling, but only with respect to\n\nhis claims of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation and\n\npunitive damages.   The breach of fiduciary duty claim was tried\n\nto the jury, which found for King Auction.2   Plaintiff appeals\n\nfrom that result, alleging error in the trial court’s exclusion\n\nof certain evidence.\n\n         We consider, first, the district court’s dismissal of\n\nclaims upon summary judgment, and second, the correctness of the\n\ndistrict court’s ruling excluding evidence at trial.   Discerning\n\nno error, we affirm in all respects.3\n\nI.       Factual Background4\n\n\n     2Before trial, Kearney had voluntarily dismissed his claim\nof unfair trade practices. At trial, the district court granted\nKing Auction’s motion for judgment as a matter of law on\nKearney’s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress,\na determination from which no appeal has been taken.\n     3Defendants filed a cross-appeal conditioned on this court\nreversing in some part the judgment of the district court. As\nwe affirm that judgment in all respects, defendants’ cross-\nappeal is moot.\n     4The facts described below are taken from the record before\nthe district court at summary judgment, which contained\nextensive deposition testimony and documentary evidence.      In\nPart III of this opinion, when we discuss the evidentiary ruling\nat trial, we do so in the context of further evidence admitted\nduring trial, which, in order to keep separate from the analysis\nof the evidence at summary judgment, we do not describe until\nPart III.\n\n                               -3-\n\f                     In February 1997, Kearney purchased eighty acres of\n\nundeveloped waterfront land in Lubec, Maine, for $90,000.                                    By\n\nhis own account, he had spent considerable time surveying the\n\nland       before          negotiating      from   $300,000,    the       original       asking\n\nprice,          to    the    final   sale     price    of    $90,000.           He   thereupon\n\nattempted             to    sell   the   land      himself    for    a    profit,       placing\n\nadvertisements in various national and international newspapers\n\nsuch       as    the       Wall    Street    Journal    and    the       Hong    Kong    Daily.\n\nShortly thereafter, Donald Long, a Canadian businessman and\n\nacquaintance of Kearney’s, offered to buy the eighty acres for\n\n$1.8 million.                The two men entered into an informal written\n\nagreement at the end of February 1997.5\n\n                     Before formalization of the deal between Long and\n\nKearney, Michael Keracher from King Auction called Kearney with\n\nan offer to evaluate the land.                         Keracher had seen Kearney’s\n\nadvertisement and thought King Auction could sell Kearney’s land\n\nfor him at a competitive price.                     During that first conversation,\n\nKearney told Keracher that he had an offer from Long for $1.8\n\nmillion, which hadn’t been “completely finalized.”                                      Kearney\n\ntestified that Keracher told him that “the property was just\n\n\n       5\n      The deal between Long and Kearney was that Long would pay\nKearney $200,000 Canadian as a down payment and would pay off\nthe balance overtime at seven percent interest. The date of the\nagreement was February 28, 1997 and was to be finalized on March\n8, 1997.\n\n                                                -4-\n\fworth a lot more money that what [Kearney] was getting out of\n\nit . . . .    He said, I will fly up right now . . . and look at\n\nit and I can give you an evaluation of what I think . . . .\n\n[I]t would be worth your while, because it isn’t going to cost\n\nyou anything for me to check it out . . . .”            Kearney testified\n\nthat he was inclined to show Keracher the land, but not before\n\nspeaking with Long.\n\n           Long did not insist that the agreement between him and\n\nKearney was binding to the extent of precluding Kearney from\n\nshowing Keracher the land.           Long did express his skepticism,\n\nhowever, with regard to Keracher’s offer to sell the land for\n\nmore than the $1.8 million Long had offered.            Kearney testified\n\nthat Long “wanted to know how anybody else could get so much\n\nmoney out of it, and he wanted to meet with him [Keracher].”              So\n\nKeracher flew up to Maine from Alabama a few days later to visit\n\nwith Kearney and Long and to see the eighty acres in Lubec.\n\n           Keracher spent no more than one hour on the property,\n\nwhich was covered with more than twenty inches of snow at the\n\ntime.    Keracher testified that he did not speak with local real\n\nestate   agents   or   visit   any    other   parcels   of   land    nearby.\n\nKearney testified that Keracher “mentioned numbers, three to ten\n\nmillion dollars for the property” and that “[Keracher] felt it\n\nwould bring a minimum of three million dollars.”                    Although\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fKearney fell short of testifying that he understood Keracher to\n\nbe guaranteeing an auction price of at least three million\n\ndollars, Kearney did say that Keracher “just said many, many\n\ntimes . . . I’m sure it would bring in three million dollars.”\n\nWhen Kearney was asked “did you believe that you were being\n\nguaranteed   that    he    would   get   a   price   like   that?”,   Kearney\n\nresponded, “I believed that he was going to get three million\n\ndollars or more out of it . . . .             I felt that, sure enough,\n\nthey [King Auction] were going to get me over -- if they were\n\ngoing to get me over 1.8 million that it would be my interest to\n\ngo   with   them.”        Long   testified    to     essentially    the   same\n\nstatement.    Long explained that although Keracher “would not\n\nguarantee it, . . . he said he would get a minimum of 3.5\n\n[million dollars], and he thought up to ten million dollars.”\n\n            After viewing the property, Kearney drove Keracher\n\nfurther north to Fredericton, in New Brunswick, Canada, to visit\n\nLong who was waiting for them in a Sheraton Hotel.                    Kearney\n\ndescribed the meeting in the hotel room during which Long asked\n\nKeracher how King Auction “could get so much money out of th[e]\n\nproperty.”      Both       Kearney   and      Long    describe     Keracher’s\n\nexplanation as being that King Auction drew “heavy hitters,”\n\npeople both Keracher and Long described as “Hollywood people”\n\nand “big movie stars . . . [who] like places like that that’s\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fisolated.”      The implication was that those “heavy hitters” would\n\nbid up the price of the land.                Long reiterated, however, that\n\neven though “[Keracher] was quite sure that he could get [$3-$10\n\nmillion] out of it . . . it was an auction, so – you know–.”\n\nAsked    if    Long    meant    that    he     understood    there    to   be    no\n\nguarantees, Long replied “Well, that was . . . my opinion.”\n\n              Keracher denied speaking to Kearney or to Long about\n\nthe dollar amount the land could bring at auction.                  He explained\n\nthat “[w]e never do that,” speaking to the King Auction policy\n\nthat forbids agents from evaluating the object to be auctioned.\n\n“That is one thing that we are told by King [Auction], by our\n\ncompany, you never mention value.              You can’t.”    Keracher did say\n\nthat he recalls telling both Long and Kearney that the land was\n\nunique because of its size and its location on the ocean.                        He\n\nsaid that he had “looked at materials, advertisements, other\n\nadvertisements for land for sale in Maine, and had only been\n\nable to come across smaller parcels, five acres, three acres,\n\ntwo acres, ten acres.           And [Kearney’s land] was unique in that\n\nrespect, that it was a larger parcel.                It was eighty acres of\n\nwhat    they   said    was     ocean   front    property.”      Keracher     also\n\ntestified that he told Kearney that                  King Auction had been\n\nsuccessful     in     selling    “premier      properties”   such    as    his   --\n\npremier properties being defined by King Auction as worth over\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fa million dollars -- and that King Auction sells such properties\n\non a regular basis.   Keracher gave Kearney a list of people who\n\nhad sold their property through King Auction in the past as\n\nreferences, encouraging Kearney to call them.\n\n            At the end of the meeting between Long, Kearney and\n\nKeracher, Long agreed to let Kearney out of their informal\n\ncontract.    Kearney and Keracher then drove to the Bangor, Maine\n\nairport to return Keracher to Alabama.       During that drive,\n\nKearney and Keracher discussed the details of the auction, in\n\nparticular, what kind of auction it would be and who would pay\n\nthe up-front costs.   Keracher estimated the cost of the auction\n\nand advertising would run around $40,000.    Kearney did not want\n\nto pay it all, and the two men discussed the possibility of\n\nsplitting the cost.    The two men also discussed the possibility\n\nof the auction being an absolute auction, an auction with a\n\nreserve, or an auction with a published reserve.        Keracher\n\ndescribed an auction with reserve as less risky because the\n\nseller “can either accept or reject the highest bid.”   Likewise,\n\nan auction with a published reserve announces in advance that\n\nthe seller is not going to sell the property for less than a\n\ncertain amount of dollars.   The absolute auction as described by\n\nKeracher to Kearney “attracts the most interest because people\n\nread that its going to sell without reserve . . . and you can\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fexpect to bring in more bidders, and because of more bidders\n\nyou’ll have more competition, and hopefully you’ll get . . . the\n\nmarket value of the property.”              The risks of the absolute\n\nauction described by Keracher to Kearney were that the seller\n\n“take[s] what it brings . . . no matter what [King Auction]\n\ndo[es],    no   matter   how    beautiful   a   brochure    [King   Auction]\n\nprint[s], no matter how many ads [King Auction] place[s], at\n\nsome point in time [the] property must stand on its own.                  It\n\nwill bring what it’s worth.”\n\n            By plaintiff’s own account, the drive to Bangor airport\n\ndid not resolve the details of the auction.                Both Kearney and\n\nKeracher testified that no final agreement had been reached.\n\nNot until further telephone calls and discussions regarding the\n\nabove mentioned decisions, did Kearney and Keracher agree that\n\nthey would split the cost of the auction and that the auction\n\nwould proceed as an absolute auction rather than one with a\n\nreserve.    Kearney did say that Keracher expressed his preference\n\nto proceed with an absolute auction, feeling that it would\n\nattract more bidders.          To the same end, Keracher testified that\n\nKearney “may have said . . . [that he was] not afraid of an\n\nabsolute auction.”6\n\n\n    6   Apparently, Kearney had described to Keracher two other\nproperty auctions he had attended, one that was cancelled before\nit started and another that did not result in a sale. It was at\n\n                                     -9-\n\f         After a month and a half of sending various copies of\n\nthe auction contract to each other, on April 17, 1997, Kearney\n\nsigned King Auction’s agreement, initialing every page.   Kearney\n\nsaid he did not read the contract “word for word, but I looked\n\nthrough it.”    Kearney explains that he did not read the contract\n\nthoroughly because he had confidence in Keracher – “I had a\n\nhundred percent trust in him . . . [he] was a professional, and\n\nhe was an expert in what he was doing.”\n\n         The contract specifies the duties of King Auction, such\n\nas to “prepare and distribute advertising and sales literature\n\nin a manner reasonably calculated to advise persons who might be\n\ninterested in the PROPERTY and the sale thereof” and to “prepare\n\na full-color, descriptive sales brochure with photographs of the\n\nproperty.”     The contract also contains a disclaimer that the\n\nseller, Kearney,\n\n         acknowledges and understands that neither\n         KING nor any of its agents, employees, or\n         representatives have guaranteed or promised\n         that the PROPERTY, in whole or in part,\n         shall produce a specific price or that a\n         certain minimum price will be bid at the\n         AUCTION. SELLER is not relying on KING for\n         advice on the following: legal; accounting;\n         taxes; or the laws, rules or regulations of\n         any government. This AGREEMENT contains the\n         entire understanding of the parties, and all\n         prior understandings and negotiations have\n         been merged herein. SELLER is not relying\n\n\nthe latter auction where he learned of the property at issue.\n\n                                -10-\n\f            upon any statements or representations made\n            by or on behalf of KING that are not\n            specifically set forth in this AGREEMENT.\n\n            In     fulfillment     of   its     duties,      King    Auction      then\n\nadvertised the auction in nation-wide newspapers and magazines,\n\nprepared    full-color       brochures,        and   mailed    several      thousand\n\nbrochures     to    people    on    their      mailing       list.        Keracher’s\n\nundisputed       deposition    testimony       was    that    approximately        130\n\npeople responded to the advertisements requesting brochures and\n\nfifty people responded after receiving those brochures.                             Of\n\nthose, between eight and twelve people paid twenty-five dollars\n\neach to receive full property information packages.                            None,\n\nhowever, showed up at the auction.\n\n            Only two people attended the auction to bid on the\n\nproperty.    At this point, Keracher alleges that he asked Kearney\n\nif he wanted to continue with the auction and Kearney said yes.\n\nKearney contends to the contrary, testifying that it was he who\n\nwanted to stop the auction but Keracher would not listen and\n\nproceeded anyway.          Kearney claims that at that point he felt\n\nthat King Auction failed to successfully advertise to attract\n\nbidders.     He said that he also felt that King Auction failed to\n\nhonor his wishes as his agent to stop the auction when only two\n\nbidders showed up.           When the auction started and one bidder\n\ndropped    out     after   the     price    per      acre   rose     to   $100,    the\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fauctioneer attempted to change the auction from absolute to\n\nreserve.     This attempt failed.       The first bidder, successfully\n\nbidding $8,000 for the property, sued Kearney in Maine Superior\n\nCourt winning a judgment that ordered Kearney to convey the\n\nland.\n\n            This lawsuit by Kearney against King Auction followed.\n\nAll other claims being disposed of prior to trial, the jury\n\ndecided only Kearney’s claim against King Auction for breach of\n\nfiduciary duty.       It found no such breach, apparently believing\n\nthat King Auction, despite holding the auction when only two\n\nbidders were present, nevertheless fulfilled its fiduciary duty\n\nto Kearney.       Judgment was entered for King Auction.\n\nII.     Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n            A.       Misrepresentation Claims\n\n            Kearney’s misrepresentation claims were premised on\n\nKeracher’s statements to him that (1) at auction Kearney’s\n\neighty acres in Lubec would sell for between $3 and $10 million,\n\nand   (2)   the    auction   would   attract   “heavy   hitters.” 7   The\n\n\n\n      7\n      Although Keracher disputes that he ever made these precise\nstatements, for purposes of summary judgment, we take the record\nin the light most favorable to the Kearney, the non-moving\nparty. New York State Dairy Foods, Inc. v. Northeast Dairy\nCompact Comm’n, 198 F.3d 1,3 (1st Cir. 1999).          Kearney’s\ntestimony, along with Long’s, allow us to comfortably conclude\nfor summary judgment purposes that a fact finder could find that\nthese statements were made as both of these men say they were.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fdefendants contend that these statements, assuming they were\n\nmade, are not actionable under Maine common law as they are not\n\nstatements of present fact but expressions about belief about\n\nand hope for the future.    Defendants further contend that the\n\nrecord at summary judgment fails to create a jury question as to\n\nKearney’s justifiable reliance on these statements to support\n\neither cause of action.8   Determining, as we do, that defendants\n\nare correct with regard to their first contention – that, as a\n\nmatter of Maine law, neither statements are of present fact,\n\nhence, not actionable under Maine law as misrepresentations – we\n\naffirm the district court’s judgment.9\n\n\n    8  Claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation,\nalthough obviously distinct, both require that the defendant\nhave made a false representation of present fact and that the\nplaintiff justifiably relied on the representation as true. As\nclaims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation share\nthese two elements, we do not distinguish the two for purposes\nof this appeal. We note, too, that the plaintiff in his brief\ncollapsed his analysis of the two misrepresentation claims for\nthe   same   reason.      For   the   elements   of   fraudulent\nmisrepresentation, see, e.g. Glynn v.

See Wildes\n\n\nthat Kearney failed to proffer sufficient evidence from which a\nreasonable jury could find that King Auction recklessly\ndisregarded the truth of the above statements.     The district\ncourt said that although King Auction was wrong, “being wrong\ndoes not make its statements intentional misrepresentations. ...\nAdditionally, it is dubious whether Kearney could justifiably\nrely on King’s representations.

Allowing a finding of deceit to be\n            based   on   a   disingenuous    promise   of\n            employment, the Wildes court quoted Shine:\n            “The relationship of the parties or the\n            opportunity afforded for investigation and\n            the reliance . . . may transform into an\n            averment of fact that which under ordinary\n            circumstances would be merely an expression\n            of opinion.”     389 A.2d at 840 (quoting\n            Shine, 157 A. at 318).\n\nVielleux,    206   F.3d    at    119-20.         This   court’s   conclusion    in\n\nVielleux    was    that    “in       appropriate    circumstances,       promises\n\nconcerning    future      performance       may    be   sufficiently     akin   to\n\naverments     of    fact        as     to   be     actionable     under    Maine\n\nmisrepresentation law.”          Id.    As the two statements at issue are\n\nboth statements about the hoped-for outcome of the auction,\n\ni.e., a future event at which Keracher arguably promised “heavy\n\nhitters” would be present and that the land would sell for\n\nbetween $3 and $10 million, the question is whether this case\n\npresents the “appropriate circumstance[]” in which Keracher’s\n\n“promises    concerning      [the      outcome     of   the   auction]    may   be\n\nsufficiently akin to averments of fact as to be actionable under\n\nMaine law,” id.        In other words, we must decide whether the\n\n                                        -15-\n\finteraction between Kearney and Keracher was such that Kearney\n\n“justifiably       understood        [Keracher’s      promises      of       future\n\nperformance] as being of fact and not mere opinion.”                     Wildes,\n\n389 A.2d at 840.\n\n            The Maine cases in which statements of opinion “have\n\nbeen justifiably understood as being of fact” have arisen under\n\ncircumstances in which the plaintiff is “at the mercy of the\n\ndefendant,” such as in employment situations where an employer,\n\nwith     full    knowledge     of     imminent       corporate      downsizing,\n\nnevertheless promises a position to a new salesperson.

We drew upon this reasoning in Veilleux as support\n\nfor upholding (in relevant part) a jury verdict in favor of\n\nplaintiffs’ claim for a misrepresentation where the plaintiffs\n\nwere not employees suing their employer over promises of further\n\nemployment,      but,   when   the    statements     were   made,     were    in   a\n\nsimilarly vulnerable position.\n\n            In Veilleux, the defendants were truck drivers who were\n\nbeing featured in a television news program and were promised by\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fthe   defendant    news    station      that,    among   other   things,    an\n\norganization antagonistic to their profession (Parents Against\n\nTired Truckers (PATT)), would not be included in the program.\n\nOne factor influencing this court’s conclusion that the jury\n\ncould reasonably construe that promise as an averment of present\n\nfact was that the news station’s statements concerned “aspects\n\nof the program within [its] exclusive control [and] upon which\n\n[plaintiff] reasonably could have relied.”               Veilleux, 206 F.3d\n\nat 120.

Equally\n\nimportant, however, to this court’s conclusion in Veilleux that\n\nthe relevant statement was an actionable misrepresentation more\n\nclosely akin to an averment of present fact than of future\n\nperformance was that at the time the statement was made,\n\n          a jury could reasonably find . . . that the\n          defendants deliberately concealed from [one\n          plaintiff], at the time they told him that\n          PATT would not be included, the fact that\n          they had already filmed and recorded taped\n          comments highly critical of truckers from\n          PATT’s co-founders . . . in preparation for\n          use in the projected program . . . .    The\n          program was therefore already a work in\n          progress when the misrepresentation was\n          made. A promise not to include PATT and the\n          concealment of prior PATT filming can be\n\n                                     -17-\n\f            regarded under the rational of Wildes and\n            Boivin as pertaining to existing “facts”\n            rather than mere opinions or projections.\n            Accordingly, we do not think the fact that\n            defendants’   alleged   representation    to\n            exclude PATT also pertained to a time in the\n            future (i.e., when the completed program\n            would be aired) prevents it from being\n            actionable as a misrepresentation of fact\n            under recent Maine law.\n\nVeilleux, 206 F.3d at 120-21.\n\n            None   of     the   factors     present    in    Veilleux   --     a\n\ndefendant’s exclusive control over and deliberate concealment of\n\ncritical information -- which factors track those considered and\n\nrelied upon by Maine courts, are present in this case.                     With\n\nregard to the first statement about the market value of land to\n\nbe garnered at auction, the relationship between Kearney and\n\nKing Auction was not vulnerable or one-sided such that Kearney\n\ncould not undertake his own investigation into the market value\n\nof his property or the range of values of land sold by King at\n\nauction.     On the contrary, the evidence was undisputed that\n\nKeracher    encouraged     Kearney   to     inquire   into    King   Auction’s\n\nreferences, those presumably being individuals on behalf of whom\n\nKing   Auction     sold   premier    properties       and    individuals     who\n\npurchased such properties at auctions organized by King Auction.\n\nMoreover, Kearney had been to a couple of auctions himself and\n\nhad experience with evaluating, buying and selling land in\n\nMaine.     He, as much as King Auction, should have been able to\n\n                                     -18-\n\finvestigate whether or not the $3 to $10 million figure was a\n\nreasonable one for the price of waterfront land in Lubec, Maine.\n\nNor    was    there     any   evidence    that      Keracher      was   deliberately\n\nconcealing something from Kearney that would make Keracher’s\n\nestimate of $3 to $10 million more like an averment of present\n\nfact than of future aspirations.                    This statement is in stark\n\ncontrast to the one at issue in Veilleux where the promise not\n\nto include the PATT footage was made after that footage had\n\nalready been filmed.\n\n              As for the second statement about “heavy hitters”,\n\nthere is little evidence in the record tending to establish that\n\nKeracher was lying when he said that King Auction’s auctions\n\nattract “heavy hitters.”           Whereas plaintiff provided no evidence\n\nthat those “heavy hitters” did not exist or did not attend other\n\nKing    Auction       auctions,   it     is   undisputed     that       King   Auction\n\nprovided plaintiff a list of references of former clients and\n\nattendees, the relative wealth of which plaintiff could have\n\ninvestigated to assure himself of the truth of Keracher’s “heavy\n\nhitters” statement.             For ought that appears, King Auction’s\n\nother        auctions     had     attracted         “heavy       hitters”      however\n\nunsuccessful the later situation in Kearney’s case.                       To be sure,\n\nthe fact that Kearney’s own auction played to a total absence of\n\nthe    so-called      “heavy    hitters”      may    be   some    evidence     of   the\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\ffalsity of King Auction’s statement that its auctions drew\n\n“heavy hitters.”   Standing alone, however, it is not enough to\n\ncreate a jury question on the issue of misrepresentation.\n\n         Moreover, it is important to note that in stating that\n\nKing Auction’s auctions attract “heavy hitters,” Keracher did\n\nnot guarantee Kearney that those “heavy hitters” would show up\n\nat his auction.    A reasonable interpretation of the statement,\n\nespecially in light of the auction contract both parties signed\n\n(e.g., defining King Auction’s duty, in part, to “prepare and\n\ndistribute   advertising   and   sales   literature   in   a   manner\n\nreasonably calculated to advise persons who might be interested\n\nin the PROPERTY and the sale thereof”), is that King Auction’s\n\nclient list and reputation was such that its auctions could\n\nattract wealthy bidders who are prepared to pay a high price for\n\npremier properties.   It should have been obvious, however, from\n\nthe signed auction contract negotiated by both parties and the\n\nnature of voluntary auctions themselves, that King Auction had\n\nno real control over who chose to attend any of its auctions,\n\naside from doing its best to publicize the event and market the\n\nproperty, duties which Kearney failed to show that King Auction\n\ndid not fulfill.      On the contrary, the undisputed evidence\n\ndemonstrated that King Auction prepared and placed nation-wide\n\nadvertisements, printed and sent to individuals on its mailing\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\flist brochures describing the property, followed up with those\n\nindividuals      requesting      further      information   with    full-color\n\nbrochures.10       Plaintiff’s     only    counter-evidence     was    his   own\n\ndeposition testimony in which he states, without foundation,\n\nthat he felt that King Auction failed to successfully attract\n\nbidders.       This self-serving and conclusory statement of opinion\n\nhas no probative value as to the truth of Keracher’s statement\n\nthat    King    Auction’s    auctions      attract   “heavy   hitters”,      the\n\nquestion a jury was to have decided had the misrepresentation\n\nclaim survived.\n\n             In any event, both statements at issue here are akin\n\nto those in this court’s decision in Schott Motorcycle Supply,\n\nInc. v.

In Schott, plaintiff, a motorcycle dealership, was\n\nallegedly      promised     by   the   defendant,    American      Honda   Motor\n\nCompany, that Honda Motor Company would remain just as committed\n\nto the motorcycle industry as it had in the past and that new\n\nHonda products and programs would cause an increase in Honda\n\nsales.      Allegedly relying on these assurances, plaintiff split\n\ninto two businesses, one exclusively selling Honda motorcycles,\n\n\n       10\n       That King Auction would retain a percentage of the price\nof the sale also suggested that it would have been against its\ninterest not to try to market the auction as best it could.\n\n                                       -21-\n\fand the other selling Harley Davidsons and golf carts.                      Within\n\nthree years, the business that was solely devoted to Honda\n\nmotorcycles        went    under,     due   in   whole    part,   contended      the\n\nplaintiff, to the defendant’s false assurances of continued\n\nproduct development and commitment.                This court, citing Boivin\n\nand Shine, supra, affirmed the district court’s dismissal of\n\nplaintiff’s fraud claim that was based on the above statements\n\nbecause      the    “alleged      misrepresentations       consisted      only    of\n\nopinions as to future events . . . .                These general statements\n\nin   the   context        of   the    franchisor-franchisee       communications\n\nconstitute nothing more than ’puffing’ or ’trade talk,’ upon\n\nwhich no reasonable person would rely.”                  Schott, 976 F.2d at 65\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n             Like the statements in Schott, the statements at issue\n\nhere   are    no    more       than   averments    of    the   defendants’    high\n\nexpectations       for     the   auction    King   Auction     was   to   oversee.\n\nIndeed, the district court, in ruling for the defendants on this\n\nissue, cited to Sontag v. Eaton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Me. 1978), a case\n\nthat merely reaffirms what is black letter law in Maine:                      that\n\na statement made by a seller of land regarding its estimated\n\nvalue is “dealer’s talk” and cannot be actionable fraud should\n\nthe market price of the land be in actuality much lower.                         See\n\nid. at 37 (“[M]isrepresentations as to value and quality of land\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fmade by the vendor, even though made with fraudulent intent, are\n\nnot   actionable      .   .   .   .    Such   representations    are   ’dealer’s\n\ntalk.’”).      Although King Auction was not the owner of the land\n\nto be sold, King Auction was “selling” the benefits of its\n\nservices on the basis of the perceived quality of Kearney’s land\n\nand its expertise in the auction process.                As a businessman who\n\nsells   land    at    auction,        Keracher’s    statements   regarding   the\n\npotential “heavy hitters” at auction and the land’s hoped-for\n\nsale price of $3 to $10 million\n\n            should have been understood [by Kearney] to\n            be[] but the use of extravagant language of\n            the class known to every man of ordinary\n            experience as “dealer’s talk,” i.e., “that\n            picturesque and laudatory style affected by\n            nearly every trader in setting forth the\n            attractive qualities of the goods he offers\n            for sale,” and this even among friends. But\n            such is not actionable. The law recognizes\n            the   fact  that   sellers   may   naturally\n            overstate the value and quality of the\n            articles of property which they have to\n            sell. Everybody knows this, and a buyer has\n            no right to rely on such statements.\n\nId. at 37-38 (citations omitted).               See also id. at 38 (stating\n\nthat “[s]ince an express statement by the Eatons that their\n\nproperty    was      worth    eighty     thousand    ($80,000)   dollars,    the\n\nselling price, . . . would not be actionable fraud, but merely\n\nan opinion of the sellers which the buyers must expect to be\n\nlikely inflated as puffing or dealer’s talk, their failure to\n\ndisclose the alleged fact, if true, that the actual investments\n\n                                         -23-\n\fin the property did not reflect the true value of the property\n\nwould also not be actionable fraud”).\n\n               We    conclude,       therefore,    that     no     action     for\n\nmisrepresentation            lies     under    Maine      law     under     these\n\ncircumstances.

Evidentiary Ruling at Trial\n\n               During trial on plaintiff’s remaining claim for breach\n\nof fiduciary duty, plaintiff asked to introduce evidence of the\n\ntwo statements that were the basis of his previously dismissed\n\nmisrepresentation claims.              The trial court, questioning the\n\nrelevance of the statements to the claim the jury had to decide\n\n\n\n       11 In any case, the evidence before the district court at\nthe time of its summary judgment ruling fails to meet Maine’s\nmalice standard for punitive damages.     “Maine law requires a\nplaintiff to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendant was motived by ’ill will’ toward the plaintiff, or\nacted so ’outrageously’ that malice could be inferred.”\nVeilleux, 206 F.3d at 135 (citing Tuttle v. Raymond, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1353</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1361 (Me. 1985)).     See also Boivin (reversing a jury\nverdict for punitive damages despite upholding the jury finding\nfor fraud based on false assurances of future employment).\n\n                                        -24-\n\f(breach of fiduciary duty), ordered arguments and proffers on\n\nthe relevance issue for the following morning before the jury\n\nwas to be brought in.\n\n           Plaintiff’s    position     was    that    the   statements   were\n\nrelevant to the breach of fiduciary duty claim because they were\n\nmade during the scope of the agency relationship and, as he\n\ncontended they were false or misleading, they bore on the issue\n\nof whether Keracher breached his fiduciary duty to Kearney. 12\n\nDefendants’ position was that the statements were not relevant\n\nbecause    they   could   not   have   been    made    during   the   agency\n\nrelationship as they were undisputably made on the first day\n\nKearney and Keracher met and therefore before any fiduciary duty\n\narose.13   When the court pressed the plaintiff to substantiate\n\nhis position that the agency relationship between Kearney and\n\n\n     12Presumably, plaintiff relies here on a fiduciary’s duty\nof good faith and, in some instances, material disclosure.

Bogert, Trusts and\nTrustees § 544, at 407-08 (2d ed. 1978)).\n     13 This position was in addition to defendants’ assertion\nthat the statements, assuming they were made, were not false or\nmisleading.\n\n                                  -25-\n\fKing Auction began on the very first day Kearney met Keracher,\n\nplaintiff explained “that [a] fiduciary relationship is not a\n\nlightning bolt.        It’s more analogous to a web that’s being\n\nwoven.    And the web began when these gentlemen met and continued\n\nand was reenforced and developed until it matured on May 14 [the\n\ndate of the auction].      That is our position.”\n\n            The court continued to be perplexed by plaintiff’s\n\nposition regarding the statements’ relevancy, and asked the\n\nplaintiff    directly:     “when    is    the    first   manifestation   of\n\nagreement between King [Auction] and Kearney that there will be\n\nan auction and a relationship?”           To this, plaintiff’s counsel\n\nresponded:    “I would represent to you that in . . . the car as\n\nMr. Kearney drives back from Fredericton to Bangor to drop Mr.\n\nKeracher off at the airport, he will indicate to you that at\n\nthat time he had decided that it was — the property was going to\n\nbe auctioned and he and Mr. Keracher discussed the methodology\n\nof the auction . . . .      That’s why the conversations progressed\n\nthat far, because there had been an agreement in the course of\n\nthat car ride . . . .”       Having heard this apparent concession\n\nfrom     plaintiff’s    counsel    that    the    earliest    the   agency\n\nrelationship began was on the way from Canada to the Maine\n\nairport, the court then asked counsel when the statements were\n\nmade, to which he responded “A very precise question, and I have\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fto give you a precise answer.           We’re at the other end of the car\n\nride.   They’re before you get to Bangor.            They are part of what\n\nleads up to coming down to Bangor.”\n\n            Having   received     this    apparent    concession      that   the\n\nstatements at issue were made before an agency relationship\n\nbetween Kearney and King Auction had formed, the district court\n\nruled the statements irrelevant and inadmissible, stating that\n\n“the fiduciary obligation flows from the agency relationship.\n\nThat is not established until there is an agreement, whether it\n\nbe written or oral.         I understand what [plaintiff’s counsel] is\n\nproposing.    But these are matters that go to the inducement, the\n\nentering into the [agency] agreement.               They have already been\n\nruled upon in the summary judgment context.                   The questions\n\nbefore the jury will be breach of the fiduciary obligations that\n\nflow from the auction agency relationship.”                  In essence, the\n\ncourt concluded that without an agency relationship to create a\n\nfiduciary    duty    at   the   time    the   statements     were    made,   the\n\nstatements    were    not    relevant    to   any   breach    of    that   duty.\n\nBecause we can find no error, let alone reversible error, in\n\nthis reasoning, we affirm the district court’s exclusionary\n\nruling.\n\n            Implicit in the district court’s exclusionary ruling\n\nwas the court’s acceptance of the factual predicate that the\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\fagency relationship between the parties had not commenced until\n\nafter the statements were made.14         This factual predicate is not\n\nonly supported by plaintiff’s counsel’s concession at trial, it\n\nis independently supported elsewhere in the record.            Viewed as\n\na factual finding, it was not clearly erroneous.15         Kearney’s and\n\nLong’s    deposition   testimony    indicated     that   the   statements\n\nregarding the estimated value of land and King Auction’s “heavy\n\nhitters” were made just after Keracher had viewed the property\n\nand once again during the meeting with Mr. Long.          This coincides\n\nwith plaintiff’s concession at trial that the statements were\n\nmade before Keracher returned to Bangor to fly home, before, as\n\nplaintiff    also   concedes,   any       fiduciary   relationship    was\n\nmanifested between the parties.           It was, therefore, manifestly\n\nreasonable for the district court to find that the statements\n\n\n\n\n     14The parties devoted considerable time in the district\ncourt arguing about when precisely the fiduciary duty between\nKearney and King Auction arose. King Auction argued that the\nfiduciary relationship began only with the signing of the agency\ncontract.   Plaintiff argued that the fiduciary relationship\nbegan much earlier, sometime in the car ride back to Bangor.\nThe district court did not resolve the dispute, and neither do\nwe, because even if the relationship began during the ride back\nto Bangor, the statements sought to be admitted into evidence\nwere made before that relationship arose.\n     15We review preliminary findings of fact that form the\nbasis of evidentiary rulings for clear error.

Plaintiff made no argument in the district court to\n\nrefute the court’s conclusion along these lines,              e.g., that\n\nthese statements were relevant, if at all, only to the dismissed\n\nmisrepresentation claims and not to the fiduciary duty claim.\n\nWe discern no abuse of discretion in this ruling.

He contends that even if the statements\n\nwere   not     actionable       misrepresentations      when   made,    once   a\n\nfiduciary duty was established and King Auction had reason to\n\nknow that Kearney was laboring under the misconception that his\n\nland would fetch $3 to $10 million at auction, King Auction had\n\na duty as Kearney’s agent to correct Kearney’s mislaid high-\n\nhopes.   Plaintiff bases this argument on the proposition that,\n\nas his fiduciary, King Auction (via Keracher) is obligated to\n\nfully disclose “all facts within [its] knowledge which bear\n\nmaterially upon [Kearney’s] interests.”                Goldberg Realty Group\n\nv.

This rule commonly arises in\n\nMaine law with regard to the sale of land by a seller’s agent.\n\n\n\n              The rule is premised on the fact that a real\n              estate agent is not hired simply to locate a\n              buyer, but to so do as the seller’s\n              fiduciary. . . .   There is no requirement\n              that the principal prove fraud or malice on\n              the part of the agent or that the principal\n              show actual harm caused by breach of the\n              agent’s   duty.      In  a   case   alleging\n              nondisclosure, . . . the only questions are\n              whether the information was material and\n              whether it was withheld by the fiduciary.\n              The rule encourages fiduciaries to avoid\n              temptation altogether by forcing full and\n              frank disclosures.\n\n                                      -30-\n\fId. (quotation marks omitted).17\n\n            Plaintiff can secure no benefit from this Maine common\n\nlaw rule.

This sound rule of waiver\n\nprotects district courts from having to second-guess and read\n\nbetween the lines of the briefing presented to it by opposing\n\nparties.    As we have said, “[o]verburdened trial judges cannot\n\n\n\n\n    17 Although we affirm the jury verdict for King Auction, we\nnote that under Maine law the only apparent remedy for breach of\nfiduciary duty in this context would appear to be the return of\nthe broker’s commission, here some small percentage of the\n$8,000 for which the land sold. See Goldberg Realty Group, 669\nA.2d at 190 (reaffirming previous holding “that the broker\nforfeits any right to a commission if he breaches [fiduciary]\nduty” of material disclosure).\n\n                                   -31-\n\fbe expected to be mind readers.”    Id.18   Plaintiff’s waiver ends\n\nthe matter.19\n\n\n     18Plaintiff confuses this waiver principle with the rule\nallowing the court of appeals to affirm a district court’s\ngranting of summary judgment on a different basis than that\nrelied on below.      The former prevents an appellant from\noverturning the district court on the basis of an argument never\npresented to the district court, furthering considerations of\njudicial economy and basic fairness; the latter furthers the\nsame goals and reaffirms the long-standing Supreme Court\nprecedent that “[w]here the decision below is correct[,] it must\nbe affirmed by the appellate court though the lower tribunal\ngave a wrong reason for its action.” Riley Co. v.

For one thing, it is not clear that the\nMaine common law rule on which plaintiff relies applies equally\nin the present context as it does in the seller-real estate\nagent context.    For another thing, the statements’ relevance\ndepends upon a strained interpretation of Keracher’s deposition\ntestimony in which he says “I told Mr. Kearney, and would tell\nhim again, especially as we got nearer to the auction, if he\nwanted to sell this property to anyone for $1.8 million, I would\nsay do it, because ... our company would be paid a commission.”\n Far from suggesting (as plaintiff urges it does) that Keracher\nhad failed to accurately apprise Kearney of material information\nregarding the potential sale price of his land, this statement\ntends to suggest that Keracher, in performing his fiduciary\nduty, strove to counsel Kearney in such as way as to comport\nwith Kearney’s wishes and interests.     Finally, as we stated,\nsupra note 16, even assuming the district court erred in\n\n                             -32-\n\f          Finding no error in the district court’s exclusionary\n\nruling,   the   verdict   is   therefore   affirmed.   Defendants’\n\nconditional cross-appeal is dismissed as moot.\n\n\n\n\nexcluding the statements as irrelevant, plaintiff is faced with\nthe further hurdle of showing that excluding the evidence\nresulted in “actual prejudice because it had a substantial and\ninjurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s\nverdict.”   Shay, 57 F.3d at 134 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Plaintiff has failed to argue for, let alone make, a\nshowing of actual prejudice.\n\n                                -33-\n\f</pre>",
