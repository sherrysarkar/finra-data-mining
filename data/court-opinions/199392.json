Litigation decisions made by\n\nparties    have    consequences.        This    case   involves      strategic\n\ndecisions made by parties in an attempt to obtain a benefit from\n\na particular ruling; when the court issued a contrary order,\n\nthose parties attempted to reverse course and get the district\n\ncourt to reach a different result under Rule 60(b), Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.   The    district     court   was   unsympathetic,        and   this    appeal\n\nfollowed.    Arthur F. Zang, Jr., and Harold P. Beck joined a\n\nnumber of other employees in filing state employment actions\n\nagainst six interrelated companies, including The Paul Revere\n\nVariable Annuity Insurance Company (\"Variable\").                     Variable,\n\nalone among the six companies, is a member of the National\n\nAssociation of Securities Dealers (\"NASD\").                    Based on that\n\nmembership the companies sought to compel arbitration against\n\nseventeen of the former employees by virtue of those employees'\n\nregistration      with   NASD.     Fifteen      of   the     seventeen     former\n\nemployees    then    voluntarily       dismissed     their    claims      against\n\nVariable and continued their claims against the remaining five\n\ncompanies; Zang and Beck remained steadfast and contested the\n\nmotions to compel arbitration.\n\n            The district court dismissed the motions to compel\n\narbitration as to the fifteen employees who no longer had claims\n\nagainst Variable and, after further argument, entered an order\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fcompelling Zang and Beck to submit their claims against the six\n\ncompanies to arbitration, finding that they both had entered\n\ninto enforceable arbitration agreements.        Faced with this court\n\norder, Zang and Beck reversed course and decided to dismiss\n\ntheir claims against Variable.           After doing so, they sought\n\nrelief from the district court's order under Rule 60(b), arguing\n\nthat the remaining five companies lacked standing on their own\n\nto compel arbitration.     The district court declined to grant\n\nrelief from its order, and Zang and Beck now appeal both that\n\ndenial and the initial order.       We affirm both orders.\n\n                                I.\n\n          In March 1997, Provident Companies, Inc. acquired The\n\nPaul   Revere   Corporation.   As    a   result,   Provident   combined\n\neffective control of its own wholly owned subsidiary, Provident\n\nLife & Accident Insurance Company, with control of The Paul\n\nRevere Variable Annuity Insurance Company and The Paul Revere\n\nProtective Life Insurance Company, two wholly owned subsidiaries\n\nof The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company, which, in turn, was\n\na wholly owned subsidiary of The Paul Revere Corporation.            In\n\nOctober 1997, a number of general managers for the Paul Revere\n\nfamily of companies, alleging that the termination of their\n\nemployment was imminent with the completion of the acquisition,\n\nfiled separate but substantially similar breach of contract\n\n\n                                -4-\n\factions in a Massachusetts trial court against all six of these\n\ncorporate entities.\n\n            As a condition of their employment, seventeen of the\n\ngeneral managers, including Zang and Beck, had registered with\n\nNASD and allegedly thereby promised to abide by NASD's rules and\n\nregulations as they were from time to time amended.                 At the time\n\nthat the employment actions were filed, the NASD Code mandated\n\narbitration of certain disputes if requested by a NASD member or\n\na person associated with a member.\n\n            Based    on    Variable's     membership     in    NASD,    the    six\n\ncompanies sought to compel arbitration of the dispute as to\n\nthose   seventeen         managers.      First,     in    January      1998    the\n\npetitioners filed a motion to compel arbitration in the state\n\ncourt, invoking the NASD Code, and asked the court to stay its\n\nhand or dismiss the case pending arbitration.                  Fifteen of the\n\nmanagers    then     voluntarily       dismissed    their     actions    against\n\nVariable     (ultimately)       with    prejudice,       removing      the    only\n\npetitioner from their cases who was a NASD member; Zang and Beck\n\nretained their claims against Variable.\n\n            Faced with the employees' objections to their motions,\n\nin   July   1998    the    companies    went   to   federal    district       court\n\nseeking orders staying the state court actions and compelling\n\narbitration by all seventeen former employees, invoking the\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fFederal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and\n\nresting jurisdiction on diversity, see 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a).                   In\n\nSeptember 1999, the district court denied the petition to compel\n\narbitration as to those fifteen managers who had dismissed\n\nVariable on the ground that the remaining petitioners, absent\n\nVariable     as   a   defendant,       lacked      standing     under   NASD's\n\narbitration protocol.       See Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins. Co.\n\nv. Thomas, 66 F. Supp. 2d 217, 223-28 (D. Mass. 1999).                      This\n\ncourt upheld that denial.          See Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins.\n\nCo. v. Kirschhofer, 226 F.3d 15, 18-26 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             Unlike   the    other     fifteen      managers,     instead     of\n\ndismissing Variable, Zang and Beck opted to retain their claims\n\nagainst Variable and contest the motion to compel arbitration on\n\nthe merits.       They did so, presumably, because their largest\n\ndollar value claims were against Variable.                Specifically, Zang\n\nand Beck (1) contested the existence of a binding agreement to\n\narbitrate, (2) contended that they lacked sufficient notice of\n\nthe   amendments      to    NASD     regulations      requiring     mandatory\n\narbitration to compel them to arbitrate their employment claims,\n\nand (3) argued that, in any case, their claims fell outside the\n\nscope of the NASD arbitration provision, both because they did\n\nnot   sell   securities     and    because   the   NASD   Code   provided     an\n\nexception from arbitration for insurance business.                 In October\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f1999, after issuing its orders dismissing the petitions against\n\nthe other managers, the district court held a status conference\n\nto determine the issues in dispute with regard to Zang and Beck.\n\nThe court ordered further briefing and denied further discovery.\n\nOn January 7, 2000, the court granted the petitions against Zang\n\nand Beck and ordered the parties to arbitrate.               Zang and Beck\n\nfiled a timely appeal.\n\n           On March 13, 2000, Zang and Beck dismissed their claims\n\nagainst Variable with prejudice in the state court actions.\n\nThey then moved the district court to amend its prior orders\n\nunder   Fed.   R.   Civ.   P.   60(b),    arguing   that   since   they   had\n\ndismissed the claims against Variable, none of the remaining\n\nparties had standing under the NASD arbitration protocol to\n\ncompel arbitration.        On September 26, 2000, the district court\n\nsummarily denied Zang and Beck's Rule 60(b) motions for relief\n\nfrom final judgment.        Again Zang and Beck filed an appeal, and\n\nthis court consolidated the two appeals.\n\n                                    II.\n\n           First, Zang and Beck seek relief from the final order\n\nof the district court compelling arbitration under Rule 60(b),\n\nFed. R. Civ. P., in light of their subsequent dismissal with\n\nprejudice of their claims against Variable.            Rule 60(b) affords\n\ndistrict courts the equitable power to relieve a party from the\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fforce of a final order or judgment under certain conditions\n\nwhere necessary to serve the ends of justice. 1        Zang and Beck\n\nargue that now that Variable is no longer a party to the ordered\n\narbitration,   the   remaining   parties   lack   standing   to   compel\n\narbitration under the NASD arbitration protocol.2 Therefore they\n\nassert on appeal that Rule 60(b) relief is warranted both under\n\nclause (5), because prospective application of the arbitration\n\norder is, they say, \"no longer equitable,\" and under clause (6),\n\n\n    1    Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) provides in relevant part:\n    On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may\n    relieve a party or his legal representative from a final\n    judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\n    * * *\n    (5) the judgement has been satisfied, released, or\n    discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has\n    been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer\n    equitable that the judgment should have prospective\n    application; or\n    (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation\n    of the judgment. . . .\n    2     While respondents argue standing and suggest in passing\nthat Article III standing is lacking, we note that standing in\nthe jurisdictional sense is not at issue.           Not only is\njurisdictional standing assessed in terms of the circumstances\nat the time the action is filed, see Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 569-70 n.4 (1992) (\"The existence of\nfederal jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they\nexist when the complaint is filed.\") (quoting Newman-Green, Inc.\nv. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U.S. 826, 830 (1989)) (emphasis\nomitted), but in any case the district court clearly still had\njurisdiction at the time it entered the order and, in fact,\nthere remains a live controversy here among diverse parties even\nafter the subsequent dismissal of Variable.         Instead, the\nquestion properly conceived is what entities have a right under\nthe NASD arbitration protocols to compel arbitration, and\nwhether that \"standing\" persists upon the dismissal of Variable.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fbecause the lack of standing of the remaining parties provides\n\na \"reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\"\n\n            This effort faces two formidable hurdles.        First, Rule\n\n60(b) relief is \"extraordinary relief\" reserved for \"exceptional\n\ncircumstances,\"    given   the     countervailing     interest    in    the\n\nfinality of such orders.         See United States v. One Urban Lot,\n\n882 F.2d 582, 585 (1st Cir. 1989) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     Moreover, the district court's decision to deny\n\nrelief under Rule 60(b) is, in turn, reviewed on appeal for\n\nabuse of discretion.    See Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 891\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (\"We will find an abuse of discretion [under\n\nRule 60(b)] only when we are left with a definite and firm\n\nconviction that the lower court committed a clear error of\n\njudgment . . . .\"), cert. denied 522 U.S. 1148 (1998).           Zang and\n\nBeck fail to clear these considerable hurdles.\n\nRule 60(b)(6)\n\n            The first five subsections of Rule 60(b) allow a court\n\nto relieve a party from a final judgment on several specified\n\ngrounds, such as mistake or excusable neglect, newly discovered\n\nevidence, or fraud.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).             Rule\n\n60(b)(6)    provides   federal    district   courts   with   a   residual\n\nreservoir of equitable power to grant discretionary relief from\n\na final judgment for \"any other reason justifying relief . . .\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f.\"     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).            This residual catchall\n\nprovision   allows   a   court   to   relieve   a   party   from   a   final\n\njudgment where such relief is appropriate to accomplish justice,\n\nbut the reasons for that relief are not encompassed by the other\n\nprovisions of the rule.     Zang and Beck argue that the fact that\n\nthe only petitioner with standing under the NASD Code to compel\n\narbitration (Variable) is no longer party to the case justifies\n\nrelief from the arbitration order issued by the district court.\n\nThis is not necessarily so, and the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in denying such relief.\n\n            District courts should grant Rule 60(b)(6) motions\n\n\"only where exceptional circumstances justifying extraordinary\n\nrelief exist.\"    Ahmed, 118 F.3d at 891, citing Valley Citizens\n\nfor a Safe Environment v. Aldridge, 969 F.2d 1315, 1317 (1st\n\nCir.    1992).   District    courts      have   \"broad    discretion\"     to\n\ndetermine whether such circumstances exist.              Valley Citizens,\n\n969 F.2d at 1317.    The bar for such relief is set high because,\n\nas the Supreme Court noted in Ackermann v. United States, 340\n\nU.S. 193, 198 (1950), \"[t]here must be an end to litigation\n\nsomeday . . .,\" and therefore district courts must weigh the\n\nreasons advanced for reopening the judgment against the desire\n\nto achieve finality in litigation.         E.g. Lussier v. Dugger, 904\n\nF.2d 661, 667 (11th Cir. 1990);          see also 11 Wright et al.,\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fFederal Practice and Procedure § 2857, at 256-57 (West 1995).\n\n           The reasons for relief advanced by Zang and Beck are\n\nnot so compelling as to require the district court to grant\n\ntheir Rule 60(b) motion.             The decision to persevere in their\n\nclaims against Variable upon the filing of the petitions to\n\ncompel arbitration in federal court was a \"free, calculated, and\n\ndeliberate\" choice.              Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.              The only\n\nrelevant     change    in    circumstance        since     the    entry    of   the\n\narbitration order is Zang and Beck's also \"free, calculated, and\n\ndeliberate\" choice to dismiss Variable from their state court\n\nactions.     Ordinarily, the discretionary power granted by Rule\n\n60(b)(6) is not for the purpose of relieving a party from such\n\n\"free, calculated, and deliberate\" choices made as part of a\n\nstrategy of litigation.           E.g. id. (\"free, calculated, deliberate\n\nchoices are not to be relieved from\");                   see also id. at 200\n\n(stating   that     \"by     no    stretch   of   the     imagination      can   the\n\nvoluntary,     deliberate,          free,     untrammeled        choice   by    the\n\npetitioner    not     to    appeal\"     compare     with    the     \"exceptional\n\ncircumstances\" found in other cases); 11 Wright et al., supra §\n\n2864, at 359.       The law presumes that parties will make choices\n\nto protect their legal interests, even though those choices may\n\nat times involve a calculated risk.                    Where a party makes a\n\nconsidered choice, though it may involve some calculated risk,\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fhe \"cannot be relieved of such a choice because hindsight seems\n\nto indicate to him\" that, as it turns out, his decision was\n\n\"probably wrong.\"    Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.\n\n          Zang and Beck are correct that the facts of Ackermann\n\nare different -- that case involved a decision not to pursue an\n\nappeal.   But still, the policy embodied in Ackermann applies\n\nwith equal force in this case.      Zang and Beck persisted in their\n\nclaim against Variable, cognizant of the risk that this would\n\nlead to mandatory arbitration.            Indeed, by the time of the\n\nOctober 1999 status conference, the September dismissals of the\n\npetitions against the other fifteen managers made clear that it\n\nwas reasonably likely that this consequence could be avoided by\n\ndismissing Variable.        Nonetheless Zang and Beck continued to\n\nlitigate against the petitions to compel arbitration rather than\n\ndismissing   Variable,   gambling    that    they   could       defeat   those\n\npetitions on the merits.      Only upon the district court's order\n\ncompelling   arbitration     did   Zang     and   Beck    opt    to    dismiss\n\nVariable, hoping thereby to evade the arbitration order.\n\n          Zang and Beck chose to retain their claim against\n\nVariable, fully aware that this choice increased the likelihood\n\nthat they would be compelled to arbitrate their claims.                    Now\n\nthat this likelihood has been borne out, they cannot reverse the\n\nconsequences   of   their   decision      after   the    fact   by    suddenly\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fchanging course and then asking the district court to correct\n\nfor   their    earlier     improvident    choice.      Rather,   the   rule\n\ncontemplates that a party will take the legal steps necessary to\n\nprotect his own interests, and instead acts to relieve a party\n\nfrom extraordinary predicaments where, because of exceptional\n\ncircumstances, the party would have been unable to do so.               The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief on\n\nthe grounds here.\n\nRule 60(b)(5)\n\n             On appeal, Zang and Beck also argue that their Rule\n\n60(b) motion falls within the fifth clause of the rule, which\n\nallows   a    court   to    relieve   parties       from   judgments   with\n\nprospective effect where, inter alia, \"it is no longer equitable\n\nthat the judgment should have prospective application.\"            Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b)(5).     Petitioners contend that Zang and Beck failed\n\nto argue adequately before the district court that their case\n\nfell within the scope of this provision, and that therefore the\n\nargument is waived.        Zang and Beck respond that they did raise\n\nthe argument, and in any event they say that motions under Rule\n\n60(b) need not specifically reference a particular subsection.\n\n             We need not reach the waiver question because it is\n\nclear that Zang and Beck do not qualify for relief under Rule\n\n60(b)(5). As an initial matter, Zang and Beck's claims fall far\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\foutside the cases with which the provision is particularly\n\nconcerned,      such    as   institutional        reform    litigation,       where,\n\nbecause    the    decree     involves       the    long-term     supervision      of\n\nchanging conduct or conditions, its prospective requirements may\n\nbe rendered inappropriate by unforeseen changes in circumstance\n\nsubsequent to the entry of the order.                      See, e.g.,     Rufo v.\n\nInmates    of    Suffolk     County   Jail,       502   U.S.    367,    379   (1992)\n\n(suggesting a flexible standard is required for decrees that\n\ninvolve \"the supervision of changing conduct or conditions\" and\n\nthus of necessity are \"provisional and tentative\").\n\n           Even if we were to indulge in respondents' favor the\n\nargument that the arbitration order falls within the scope of\n\nRule   60(b)(5),       qualifying     for    relief     under    this    provision\n\nrequires    a    clear     showing    of    inequity.          Historically,     the\n\nstandard for relief from a binding decree was quite high.                       E.g.\n\nUnited States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 119 (1932) (\"No\n\ndoubt the defendants will be better off if the injunction is\n\nrelaxed, but they are not suffering hardship so extreme and\n\nunexpected as to justify us in saying that they are the victims\n\nof oppression.         Nothing less than a clear showing of a grievous\n\nwrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead us to\n\nchange what was decreed . . . .\"); see also 11 Wright et al.,\n\nsupra, § 2863, at 340-41.             It is true the Supreme Court has\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\facknowledged that greater flexibility is required in considering\n\nrequests to modify institutional reform consent decrees.                 See\n\nRufo   v.   Inmates   of   Suffolk    County   Jail,   502   U.S.   at   383.\n\nNonetheless this court has since required a considerable showing\n\nto modify decrees in private contractual disputes that lack\n\nsubstantial bearing on the public interest.            See Alexis Lichine\n\n& Cie v. Sasha A. Lichine Estate Selections, Ltd., 45 F.3d 582,\n\n586-87 (1st Cir. 1995) (describing the continuum of cases in\n\nwhich Rule 60(b)(5) is invoked).        In considering the equities of\n\nsuch a modification, a court should look to such factors as the\n\ncircumstances leading to the decree, the level of hardship on\n\nthe \"burdened\" party, and the extent to which the change in\n\ncircumstances falls outside of those contemplated at the time\n\nthe decree was issued.       The order here resolved a contractual\n\ndispute between private parties with tenuous and tangential\n\nbearing at best on the public interest; the hardship of mandated\n\narbitration is limited; and the change of circumstances lay\n\nfully within the control of (and, indeed, was caused by) the\n\nparties requesting relief.       Such facts fail to demonstrate the\n\ntype of inequity to warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief.\n\n            Zang and Beck argue that a change in facts justifying\n\nrelief from the prospective effect of a final order under Rule\n\n60(b)(5) need not be \"unforeseen and unforeseeable.\"                     This\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fassertion is correct.     See Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County\n\nJail, 502 U.S. at 385.    From this assertion Zang and Beck reason\n\nby implication that Rule 60(b)(5) relief is appropriate here,\n\nwhere the circumstances at issue were within their control both\n\nbefore and after the issuance of the district court's order.\n\nBut there is considerable distance between facts that were\n\ncompletely   unforeseen   when   an     order   was   issued   and   those\n\ncircumstances that were in both the control and contemplation of\n\nthe parties, both before and at the time of the judgment; the\n\nline was not extended so far in Rufo.           Cf. id. (\"Litigants are\n\nnot required to anticipate every exigency that could conceivably\n\narise during the life of a consent decree.         Ordinarily, however,\n\nmodification should not be granted where a party relies upon\n\nevents that actually were anticipated at the time it entered\n\ninto a decree.\").   Rather, the policy underlying Ackermann --\n\nthat parties must live with the consequences of freely made,\n\ncalculated decisions reached for strategic reasons in the course\n\nof litigation --    applies with equal force in the context of\n\nRule 60(b)(5).   See, e.g., Valentine Sugars, Inc. v. Sudan, 34\n\nF.3d 320, 322 (5th Cir. 1994) (holding that Rule 60(b)(5) relief\n\nis not appropriate where the party not only foresaw the changed\n\nconditions but created them).\n\n         On these circumstances, Zang and Beck are not entitled\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fto   relief   from     the    district     court's       order   under   either\n\nsubsection (5) or (6) of Rule 60(b).             They are not free to test\n\nthe waters, fully litigating the merits of the arbitration\n\npetition in the district court, and then, displeased with the\n\noutcome, to escape the consequences of this choice by shifting\n\nto a different course after the fact.              The orders are binding,\n\nand the circumstances are not so exceptional or unforeseen as to\n\ncompel the district court to relieve the parties from their\n\nforce.   Any \"injustice\" wrought by these orders, if it exists at\n\nall, is not so extreme -- Zang and Beck retain a right to pursue\n\ntheir    claims   on    the    merits     in     the   pending    arbitration\n\nproceedings and receive compensation if they prevail, even if\n\nthis is not their preferred forum or format.                 Finding no abuse\n\nof discretion, we affirm the district court's denial of the Rule\n\n60(b) motion.\n\n                                    III.\n\n           Zang   and   Beck    also     raise    four    challenges     to   the\n\ndistrict court's initial determination granting the petition and\n\nordering arbitration.         First, Beck contends that petitioners\n\nfailed to present sufficient evidence of the existence of any\n\nagreement to arbitrate.         Next, Zang and Beck argue that there\n\nwas no knowing and voluntary agreement to mandatory arbitration.\n\nZang and Beck also contend that they were denied discovery about\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fmaterial issues of fact in dispute regarding the continued\n\nstanding of Variable to compel arbitration.                      Finally, Zang and\n\nBeck contend that even if the NASD arbitration provisions bound\n\nthem     to    arbitrate       some     disputes,       the    insurance      business\n\nexception in the NASD Code exempted these particular disputes\n\nfrom mandatory arbitration.                    We review the district court's\n\ngrant of the motion to compel arbitration de novo.                          See Bank v.\n\nInt'l Bus. Machines, Inc., 99 F.3d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nThe Existence of an Agreement to Arbitrate\n\n               First, Beck claims that the petitioners failed to prove\n\nthe existence of any signed agreement on his part in which he\n\nagreed    to    arbitration.            NASD    records    indicate     that       Beck's\n\nregistration       was       filed    and    approved     on   November      21,    1968.\n\nHowever, the NASD has not located an actual registration form\n\nsigned    by    Beck     in    1968.        Nevertheless,      the    district      court\n\nconcluded that Beck had signed the relevant forms, relying on\n\nsecondary       evidence.            Petitioners    filed      with    the    court    an\n\naffidavit       from     a    NASD     official     containing        the    following\n\nassertions: (1) that NASD records show that Beck's registration\n\nwas both filed and approved on November 21, 1968; (2) that when\n\nBeck registered in November 1968, NASD required registrants to\n\nsign a registration application as part of its regular business\n\npractice; and (3) that despite reasonable efforts, NASD had\n\n\n                                            -18-\n\ffailed to locate Beck's application forms.                 The parties do not\n\ndispute that the relevant registration form at the time was Form\n\nA-300, and petitioners also introduced a copy of Form A-300.\n\nBeck       states     only   that    he    does    not   recall   signing      the\n\napplication, and does not contend that the form was lost in bad\n\nfaith or contest that he was in fact registered.\n\n                On this record, the district court concluded that Beck\n\nhad signed and submitted Form A-300, in which he agreed to be\n\nbound      by   any   NASD   rules    as    they   existed   at   the   time    he\n\nregistered and \"as they may from time to time be adopted,\n\nchanged, or amended.\"3 As a result, the district court concluded\n\nthat Beck had agreed to be bound by the NASD rules in effect\n\nwhen he filed suit in October 1997, which at the time required\n\narbitration of employment disputes.\n\n                On appeal, Beck argues that the district court erred\n\nin finding this evidence sufficient to conclude that he had\n\nactually signed Form A-300.               Beck says that the absence of any\n\ntestimony regarding personal knowledge that Beck had signed the\n\nform, the failure to provide any explanation for the absence of\n\nthe form from the NASD's files, the fact that the NASD affidavit\n\n\n\n       3  Petitioners did produce the form Zang signed when he\nregistered in 1974, Form B-301, in which he likewise agreed to\nbe bound by all NASD regulations as they existed and are\n\"adopted, changed, or amended.\"\n\n                                          -19-\n\fcontains the admittedly false statement that Beck's application\n\ncontained an express arbitration provision, and the fact that\n\nthe   one    partial        registration     document   NASD    did   produce\n\nregarding Beck -- the face page of an amended registration form,\n\nForm U-4, from 1996 -- did not contain Beck's signature but\n\ninstead that of another Variable employee, all militate against\n\nthe district court's conclusion.\n\n             The district court's reliance on secondary evidence is\n\nappropriate.          See, e.g., Bituminous Cas. Corp. v. Vacuum Tanks,\n\nInc., 975 F.2d 1130, 1132 (5th Cir. 1992); Fed. R. Evid. 1004,\n\nadvisory committee's note (\"if failure to produce the original\n\nis satisfactorily explained, secondary evidence is admissible\").\n\nIn particular, testimony regarding a regular business practice\n\ncan be sufficient to establish the existence and content of\n\nmissing business documents.          See, e.g., Simas v. First Citizen's\n\nFed. Credit Union, 170 F.3d 37, 52 (1st Cir. 1999) (relying on\n\ntestimony        to     establish    the   existence    of     missing   loan\n\napplication); Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Glass, No. 94 Civ. 7375\n\n(WK), 1997 WL 289858, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 30, 1997) (relying on\n\nevidence of custom and practice to use standard engagement\n\nletter      to   establish     the   existence   and    terms    of   missing\n\nengagement letters).          The fact that the affidavit erroneously\n\nstated that the application Beck signed contained an express\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\farbitration clause is not directly contradictory, as there is no\n\ndispute that if Beck signed an application, it was Form A-300,\n\nand the contents of that form are not in question.   Similarly,\n\nthe fact that the single page found of the incomplete 1996\n\namended registration form did not contain Beck's signature is\n\nnot persuasive in challenging NASD's business practices, as the\n\none page found was the first page of a three page application\n\nform, and not the one on which NASD would have required an\n\nactual signature.\n\n         It is undisputed that Beck was in fact registered with\n\nNASD in 1968, and given the convincing evidence that he would\n\nnot have been registered without a signed Form A-300 in light of\n\nNASD's business practices, the district court was not in error\n\nto conclude that he had in fact signed and submitted the form.\n\nVoluntary and Knowing Agreement to Mandatory Arbitration\n\n         Zang and Beck also contend that even if they at one\n\ntime agreed to be bound by NASD rules as they were \"adopted,\n\nchanged, or amended,\" this agreement is not sufficient to compel\n\nthem to submit to mandatory arbitration where the documents they\n\nsigned are silent as to arbitration.   Agreements to arbitrate,\n\nthey say, must be knowing and voluntary, and the forms they\n\n(allegedly) signed did not contain any mandatory arbitration\n\nprovisions, much less one regarding employment disputes.\n\n\n                             -21-\n\f          Zang and Beck rely heavily on this court's opinion in\n\nRosenberg v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 170\n\nF.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1999), to argue that the agreements that they\n\nsigned cannot serve to compel arbitration in the absence of\n\nproof of more direct awareness of and consent to the arbitration\n\nrequirement.      However, Rosenberg is different from this case in\n\ntwo   respects.      First,   Rosenberg    was    concerned         only    with\n\ncompelling arbitration in the context of federal employment\n\ndiscrimination     claims   and   relied   in    part    on    congressional\n\nhistory   expressing     particular      concerns       on    the   issue     of\n\narbitration arising out of the strong public policy against such\n\ndiscrimination.      Id. at 17-21.    By contrast, this case involves\n\na straightforward contract dispute that does not raise the\n\npublic policy concerns addressed by statutory bars to employment\n\ndiscrimination.      Moreover, the defendant in Rosenberg, Merrill\n\nLynch, had agreed expressly to familiarize its employees with\n\nthe governing regulations, and had not notified the plaintiff of\n\nthe mandatory arbitration provision.         Id. at 19.        Here Variable\n\nmade no such promise,4 and therefore Rosenberg is inapposite on\n\n\n      4   While Zang and Beck argue that NASD Rule 3010 reflects\na commitment by Variable to notify them of changes in the NASD\nCode, this is simply not the case. Rather, Rule 3010 requires\nVariable to supervise its employees to ensure that they do not\nviolate securities laws, regulations, or NASD rules, and in this\ncontext, to keep employees abreast of such regulations to ensure\ncompliance. Rule 3010 does not reach the adoption of mandatory\n\n                                  -22-\n\fthis point as well.   Other courts have compelled arbitration on\n\nsimilar agreements to abide by rules as modified in the future.\n\nSee, e.g., R.J. O'Brien & Assoc. v. Pipkin, 64 F.3d 257 (7th\n\nCir. 1995); Geldermann v. CFTC, 836 F.2d 310 (7th Cir. 1987).\n\nZang and Beck are professionals who agreed to abide by the rules\n\nand regulations of a professional organization to which they\n\nbelonged; in the absence of any commitment by the petitioners to\n\ninform them of rule changes, they cannot plead ignorance of\n\nrules with which they have agreed to comply to escape their\n\neffect.\n\nThe Denial of Discovery\n\n          Zang and Beck also challenge the district court's\n\ndenial of discovery regarding whether petitioners had cancelled\n\ntheir NASD registrations through Variable before the accrual of\n\ntheir employment claims.   Petitioners argue that the discovery\n\nrequest was untimely and therefore waived; Zang and Beck respond\n\nthat they had a right to test the legal sufficiency of the\n\npetition before pursuing factual disputes.\n\n          We need not resolve the question.   The only \"disputed\"\n\nfactual issue raised by Zang and Beck on appeal is the alleged\n\ntransfer of Zang and Beck's registration with NASD from Variable\n\n\n\narbitration for employment disputes, which falls beyond the area\nof securities regulation with which Rule 3010 is concerned.\n\n                              -23-\n\fto Washington Square Securities, Inc.      The district court denied\n\ndiscovery on this question.        The essence of Zang and Beck's\n\ntheory is that if they were registered through Washington Square\n\nand not through Variable, then Variable lacked standing to\n\ncompel arbitration.     However, NASD records before the district\n\ncourt establish that Zang and Beck were still registered with\n\nNASD through Variable at the time of the termination of their\n\nemployment.     Thus    any    question    regarding     their   alleged\n\n(additional)   registration      through       Washington    Square     is\n\nimmaterial.\n\nThe Insurance Business Exception\n\n         Zang and Beck's final argument is that their employment\n\nclaims against the petitioners fall outside the scope of the\n\nNASD arbitration provisions because the NASD Code excepts from\n\narbitration \"disputes involving the insurance business of any\n\nmember which is also an insurance company.\"          NASD Code § 1.    The\n\noverwhelming   weight   of    authority   on   the   issue   holds    that\n\nemployment with an insurance company alone is not enough to\n\ntrigger the exception unless the pending claim is entangled with\n\nthe company's insurance business to a substantial degree, and we\n\nhold that is the correct rule.      See, e.g., Armijo v. Prudential\n\nIns. Co. of America, 72 F.3d 793, 800 (10th Cir. 1995) (claims\n\nof employment discrimination against insurance company did not\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\finvolve insurance business of defendant); Cular v. Metropolitan\n\nLife Ins. Co., 961 F. Supp. 550, 558 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (breach of\n\ncontract and tort claims              in the case were \"garden-variety\"\n\nemployment      disputes    not   covered     by   the     insurance   business\n\nexception).      Since this dispute simply involves the obligations\n\nof   the   companies       to   the   managers     under    their    employment\n\ncontracts and does not substantially implicate the conduct of\n\ninsurance business, the exception is inapposite.\n\n                                       IV.\n\n           We    affirm     the   district    court's       orders   compelling\n\narbitration and denying the Rule 60(b) motion for relief from\n\nthat order.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\f",

This case involves strategic  decisions made by parties in an attempt to obtain a benefit from  a particular ruling; when the court issued a contrary order,  those parties attempted to reverse course and get the district  court to reach a different result under Rule 60(b), Fed. R. Civ.  P.  The district court was unsympathetic, and this appeal  followed.  Arthur F. Zang, Jr., and Harold P. Beck joined a  number of other employees in filing state employment actions  against six interrelated companies, including The Paul Revere  Variable Annuity Insurance Company (\"Variable\").  Variable,  alone among the six companies, is a member of the National  Association of Securities Dealers (\"NASD\").  Based on that  membership the companies sought to compel arbitration against  seventeen of the former employees by virtue of those employees'  registration with NASD.  Fifteen of the seventeen former  employees then voluntarily dismissed their claims against  Variable and continued their claims against the remaining five  companies; Zang and Beck remained steadfast and contested the  motions to compel arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the motions to compel  arbitration as to the fifteen employees who no longer had claims  against Variable and, after further argument, entered an order  compelling Zang and Beck to submit their claims against the six  companies to arbitration, finding that they both had entered  into enforceable arbitration agreements.  Faced with this court  order, Zang and Beck reversed course and decided to dismiss  their claims against Variable.  After doing so, they sought  relief from the district court's order under Rule 60(b), arguing  that the remaining five companies lacked standing on their own  to compel arbitration.  The district court declined to grant  relief from its order, and Zang and Beck now appeal both that  denial and the initial order.  We affirm both orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1997, Provident Companies, Inc. acquired The  Paul Revere Corporation.  As a result, Provident combined  effective control of its own wholly owned subsidiary, Provident  Life &amp; Accident Insurance Company, with control of The Paul  Revere Variable Annuity Insurance Company and The Paul Revere  Protective Life Insurance Company, two wholly owned subsidiaries  of The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company, which, in turn, was  a wholly owned subsidiary of The Paul Revere Corporation.  In  October 1997, a number of general managers for the Paul Revere  family of companies, alleging that the termination of their  employment was imminent with the completion of the acquisition,  filed separate but substantially similar breach of contract  actions in a Massachusetts trial court against all six of these  corporate entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a condition of their employment, seventeen of the  general managers, including Zang and Beck, had registered with  NASD and allegedly thereby promised to abide by NASD's rules and  regulations as they were from time to time amended.  At the time  that the employment actions were filed, the NASD Code mandated  arbitration of certain disputes if requested by a NASD member or  a person associated with a member.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on Variable's membership in NASD, the six  companies sought to compel arbitration of the dispute as to  those seventeen managers.  First, in January 1998 the  petitioners filed a motion to compel arbitration in the state  court, invoking the NASD Code, and asked the court to stay its  hand or dismiss the case pending arbitration.  Fifteen of the  managers then voluntarily dismissed their actions against  Variable (ultimately) with prejudice, removing the only  petitioner from their cases who was a NASD member; Zang and Beck  retained their claims against Variable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with the employees' objections to their motions,  in July 1998 the companies went to federal district court  seeking orders staying the state court actions and compelling  arbitration by all seventeen former employees, invoking the  Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. &#167; 1 et seq., and  resting jurisdiction on diversity, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a).  In  September 1999, the district court denied the petition to compel  arbitration as to those fifteen managers who had dismissed  Variable on the ground that the remaining petitioners, absent  Variable as a defendant, lacked standing under NASD's  arbitration protocol.  See Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins. Co. v. Thomas, 66 F. Supp. 2d 217, 223-28 (D. Mass. 1999).  This  court upheld that denial.  See Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins.  Co. v. Kirschhofer, 226 F.3d 15, 18-26 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the other fifteen managers, instead of  dismissing Variable, Zang and Beck opted to retain their claims  against Variable and contest the motion to compel arbitration on  the merits.  They did so, presumably, because their largest  dollar value claims were against Variable.  Specifically, Zang  and Beck (1) contested the existence of a binding agreement to  arbitrate, (2) contended that they lacked sufficient notice of  the amendments to NASD regulations requiring mandatory  arbitration to compel them to arbitrate their employment claims,  and (3) argued that, in any case, their claims fell outside the  scope of the NASD arbitration provision, both because they did  not sell securities and because the NASD Code provided an  exception from arbitration for insurance business.  In October  1999, after issuing its orders dismissing the petitions against  the other managers, the district court held a status conference  to determine the issues in dispute with regard to Zang and Beck. The court ordered further briefing and denied further discovery. On January 7, 2000, the court granted the petitions against Zang  and Beck and ordered the parties to arbitrate.  Zang and Beck  filed a timely appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 13, 2000, Zang and Beck dismissed their claims  against Variable with prejudice in the state court actions. They then moved the district court to amend its prior orders  under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), arguing that since they had  dismissed the claims against Variable, none of the remaining  parties had standing under the NASD arbitration protocol to  compel arbitration.  On September 26, 2000, the district court  summarily denied Zang and Beck's Rule 60(b) motions for relief  from final judgment.  Again Zang and Beck filed an appeal, and  this court consolidated the two appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Zang and Beck seek relief from the final order  of the district court compelling arbitration under Rule 60(b),  Fed. R. Civ. P., in light of their subsequent dismissal with  prejudice of their claims against Variable.  Rule 60(b) affords  district courts the equitable power to relieve a party from the  force of a final order or judgment under certain conditions  where necessary to serve the ends of justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Zang and Beck  argue that now that Variable is no longer a party to the ordered  arbitration, the remaining parties lack standing to compel  arbitration under the NASD arbitration protocol.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Therefore they  assert on appeal that Rule 60(b) relief is warranted both under  clause (5), because prospective application of the arbitration  order is, they say, \"no longer equitable,\" and under clause (6),  because the lack of standing of the remaining parties provides  a \"reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This effort faces two formidable hurdles.  First, Rule  60(b) relief is \"extraordinary relief\" reserved for \"exceptional  circumstances,\" given the countervailing interest in the  finality of such orders.  See United States v. One Urban Lot,  882 F.2d 582, 585 (1st Cir. 1989) (internal quotation marks  omitted).  Moreover, the district court's decision to deny  relief under Rule 60(b) is, in turn, reviewed on appeal for  abuse of discretion.  See Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 891  (1st Cir. 1997) (\"We will find an abuse of discretion [under  Rule 60(b)] only when we are left with a definite and firm  conviction that the lower court committed a clear error of  judgment . . . .\"), cert. denied 522 U.S. 1148 (1998).  Zang and  Beck fail to clear these considerable hurdles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 60(b)(6)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first five subsections of Rule 60(b) allow a court  to relieve a party from a final judgment on several specified  grounds, such as mistake or excusable neglect, newly discovered  evidence, or fraud.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule  60(b)(6) provides federal district courts with a residual  reservoir of equitable power to grant discretionary relief from  a final judgment for \"any other reason justifying relief . . .  .\"  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).  This residual catchall  provision allows a court to relieve a party from a final  judgment where such relief is appropriate to accomplish justice,  but the reasons for that relief are not encompassed by the other  provisions of the rule.  Zang and Beck argue that the fact that  the only petitioner with standing under the NASD Code to compel  arbitration (Variable) is no longer party to the case justifies  relief from the arbitration order issued by the district court. This is not necessarily so, and the district court did not abuse  its discretion in denying such relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District courts should grant Rule 60(b)(6) motions  \"only where exceptional circumstances justifying extraordinary  relief exist.\"  Ahmed, 118 F.3d at 891, citing Valley Citizens  for a Safe Environment v. Aldridge, 969 F.2d 1315, 1317 (1st  Cir. 1992).  District courts have \"broad discretion\" to  determine whether such circumstances exist.  Valley Citizens,  969 F.2d at 1317.  The bar for such relief is set high because,  as the Supreme Court noted in Ackermann v. United States, 340  U.S. 193,198 (1950), \"[t]here must be an end to litigation  someday . . .,\" and therefore district courts must weigh the  reasons advanced for reopening the judgment against the desire  to achieve finality in litigation.  E.g. Lussier v. Dugger, 904  F.2d 661, 667 (11th Cir. 1990); see also 11 Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2857, at 256-57 (West 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasons for relief advanced by Zang and Beck are  not so compelling as to require the district court to grant  their Rule 60(b) motion.  The decision to persevere in their  claims against Variable upon the filing of the petitions to  compel arbitration in federal court was a \"free, calculated, and  deliberate\" choice.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  The only  relevant change in circumstance since the entry of the  arbitration order is Zang and Beck's also \"free, calculated, and  deliberate\" choice to dismiss Variable from their state court  actions.  Ordinarily, the discretionary power granted by Rule  60(b)(6) is not for the purpose of relieving a party from such  \"free, calculated, and deliberate\" choices made as part of a  strategy of litigation.  E.g. id. (\"free, calculated, deliberate  choices are not to be relieved from\"); see also id. at 200  (stating that \"by no stretch of the imagination can the  voluntary, deliberate, free, untrammeled choice by the  petitioner not to appeal\" compare with the \"exceptional  circumstances\" found in other cases); 11 Wright et al., supra &#167;  2864, at 359.  The law presumes that parties will make choices  to protect their legal interests, even though those choices may  at times involve a calculated risk.  Where a party makes a  considered choice, though it may involve some calculated risk,  he \"cannot be relieved of such a choice because hindsight seems  to indicate to him\" that, as it turns out, his decision was  \"probably wrong.\"  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck are correct that the facts of Ackermann are different -- that case involved a decision not to pursue an  appeal.  But still, the policy embodied in Ackermann applies  with equal force in this case.  Zang and Beck persisted in their  claim against Variable, cognizant of the risk that this would  lead to mandatory arbitration.  Indeed, by the time of the  October 1999 status conference, the September dismissals of the  petitions against the other fifteen managers made clear that it  was reasonably likely that this consequence could be avoided by  dismissing Variable.  Nonetheless Zang and Beck continued to  litigate against the petitions to compel arbitration rather than  dismissing Variable, gambling that they could defeat those  petitions on the merits.  Only upon the district court's order  compelling arbitration did Zang and Beck opt to dismiss  Variable, hoping thereby to evade the arbitration order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck chose to retain their claim against  Variable, fully aware that this choice increased the likelihood  that they would be compelled to arbitrate their claims.  Now  that this likelihood has been borne out, they cannot reverse the  consequences of their decision after the fact by suddenly  changing course and then asking the district court to correct  for their earlier improvident choice.  Rather, the rule  contemplates that a party will take the legal steps necessary to  protect his own interests, and instead acts to relieve a party  from extraordinary predicaments where, because of exceptional  circumstances, the party would have been unable to do so.  The  district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief on  the grounds here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 60(b)(5)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Zang and Beck also argue that their Rule  60(b) motion falls within the fifth clause of the rule, which  allows a court to relieve parties from judgments with  prospective effect where, inter alia, \"it is no longer equitable  that the judgment should have prospective application.\"  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 60(b)(5).  Petitioners contend that Zang and Beck failed  to argue adequately before the district court that their case  fell within the scope of this provision, and that therefore the  argument is waived.  Zang and Beck respond that they did raise  the argument, and in any event they say that motions under Rule  60(b) need not specifically reference a particular subsection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach the waiver question because it is  clear that Zang and Beck do not qualify for relief under Rule  60(b)(5). As an initial matter, Zang and Beck's claims fall far  outside the cases with which the provision is particularly  concerned, such as institutional reform litigation, where,  because the decree involves the long-term supervision of  changing conduct or conditions, its prospective requirements may  be rendered inappropriate by unforeseen changes in circumstance  subsequent to the entry of the order.  See, e.g., Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 379 (1992)  (suggesting a flexible standard is required for decrees that  involve \"the supervision of changing conduct or conditions\" and  thus of necessity are \"provisional and tentative\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to indulge in respondents' favor the  argument that the arbitration order falls within the scope of  Rule 60(b)(5), qualifying for relief under this provision  requires a clear showing of inequity.  Historically, the  standard for relief from a binding decree was quite high.  E.g. United States v. Swift &amp; Co., 286 U.S. 106, 119 (1932) (\"No  doubt the defendants will be better off if the injunction is  relaxed, but they are not suffering hardship so extreme and  unexpected as to justify us in saying that they are the victims  of oppression.  Nothing less than a clear showing of a grievous  wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead us to  change what was decreed . . . .\"); see also 11 Wright et al., supra, &#167; 2863, at 340-41.  It is true the Supreme Court has  acknowledged that greater flexibility is required in considering  requests to modify institutional reform consent decrees.  See Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. at 383. Nonetheless this court has since required a considerable showing  to modify decrees in private contractual disputes that lack  substantial bearing on the public interest.  See Alexis Lichine  &amp; Cie v. Sasha A. Lichine Estate Selections, Ltd., 45 F.3d 582,  586-87 (1st Cir. 1995) (describing the continuum of cases in  which Rule 60(b)(5) is invoked).  In considering the equities of  such a modification, a court should look to such factors as the  circumstances leading to the decree, the level of hardship on  the \"burdened\" party, and the extent to which the change in  circumstances falls outside of those contemplated at the time  the decree was issued.  The order here resolved a contractual  dispute between private parties with tenuous and tangential  bearing at best on the public interest; the hardship of mandated  arbitration is limited; and the change of circumstances lay  fully within the control of (and, indeed, was caused by) the  parties requesting relief.  Such facts fail to demonstrate the  type of inequity to warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck argue that a change in facts justifying  relief from the prospective effect of a final order under Rule  60(b)(5) need not be \"unforeseen and unforeseeable.\" This  assertion is correct.  See Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County  Jail, 502 U.S. at 385.  From this assertion Zang and Beck reason  by implication that Rule 60(b)(5) relief is appropriate here,  where the circumstances at issue were within their control both  before and after the issuance of the district court's order. But there is considerable distance between facts that were  completely unforeseen when an order was issued and those  circumstances that were in both the control and contemplation of  the parties, both before and at the time of the judgment; the  line was not extended so far in Rufo.  Cf. id. (\"Litigants are  not required to anticipate every exigency that could conceivably  arise during the life of a consent decree.  Ordinarily, however,  modification should not be granted where a party relies upon  events that actually were anticipated at the time it entered  into a decree.\").  Rather, the policy underlying Ackermann    that parties must live with the consequences of freely made,  calculated decisions reached for strategic reasons in the course  of litigation --  applies with equal force in the context of  Rule 60(b)(5).  See, e.g., Valentine Sugars, Inc. v. Sudan, 34  F.3d 320, 322 (5th Cir. 1994) (holding that Rule 60(b)(5) relief  is not appropriate where the party not only foresaw the changed  conditions but created them).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these circumstances, Zang and Beck are not entitled  to relief from the district court's order under either  subsection (5) or (6) of Rule 60(b).  They are not free to test  the waters, fully litigating the merits of the arbitration  petition in the district court, and then, displeased with the  outcome, to escape the consequences of this choice by shifting  to a different course after the fact.  The orders are binding,  and the circumstances are not so exceptional or unforeseen as to  compel the district court to relieve the parties from their  force.  Any \"injustice\" wrought by these orders, if it exists at  all, is not so extreme -- Zang and Beck retain a right to pursue  their claims on the merits in the pending arbitration  proceedings and receive compensation if they prevail, even if  this is not their preferred forum or format.  Finding no abuse  of discretion, we affirm the district court's denial of the Rule  60(b) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck also raise four challenges to the  district court's initial determination granting the petition and  ordering arbitration.  First, Beck contends that petitioners  failed to present sufficient evidence of the existence of any  agreement to arbitrate.  Next, Zang and Beck argue that there  was no knowing and voluntary agreement to mandatory arbitration. Zang and Beck also contend that they were denied discovery about  material issues of fact in dispute regarding the continued  standing of Variable to compel arbitration.  Finally, Zang and  Beck contend that even if the NASD arbitration provisions bound  them to arbitrate some disputes, the insurance business  exception in the NASD Code exempted these particular disputes  from mandatory arbitration.  We review the district court's  grant of the motion to compel arbitration de novo.  See Bank v. Int'l Bus. Machines, Inc., 99 F.3d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Existence of an Agreement to Arbitrate</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Beck claims that the petitioners failed to prove  the existence of any signed agreement on his part in which he  agreed to arbitration.  NASD records indicate that Beck's  registration was filed and approved on November 21, 1968. However, the NASD has not located an actual registration form  signed by Beck in 1968.  Nevertheless, the district court  concluded that Beck had signed the relevant forms, relying on  secondary evidence.  Petitioners filed with the court an  affidavit from a NASD official containing the following  assertions: (1) that NASD records show that Beck's registration  was both filed and approved on November 21, 1968; (2) that when  Beck registered in November 1968, NASD required registrants to  sign a registration application as part of its regular business  practice; and (3) that despite reasonable efforts, NASD had  failed to locate Beck's application forms.  The parties do not  dispute that the relevant registration form at the time was Form  A-300, and petitioners also introduced a copy of Form A-300. Beck states only that he does not recall signing the  application, and does not contend that the form was lost in bad  faith or contest that he was in fact registered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, the district court concluded that beck  had signed and submitted Form A-300, in which he agreed to be  bound by any NASD rules as they existed at the time he  registered and \"as they may from time to time be adopted,  changed, or amended.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As a result, the district court concluded  that Beck had agreed to be bound by the NASD rules in effect  when he filed suit in October 1997, which at the time required  arbitration of employment disputes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Beck argues that the district court erred  in finding this evidence sufficient to conclude that he had  actually signed Form A-300.  Beck says that the absence of any  testimony regarding personal knowledge that Beck had signed the  form, the failure to provide any explanation for the absence of  the form from the NASD's files, the fact that the NASD affidavit  contains the admittedly false statement that Beck's application  contained an express arbitration provision, and the fact that  the one partial  registration document NASD did produce  regarding Beck -- the face page of an amended registration form,  Form U-4, from 1996 -- did not contain Beck's signature but  instead that of another Variable employee, all militate against  the district court's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reliance on secondary evidence is  appropriate.  See, e.g., Bituminous Cas. Corp. v. Vacuum Tanks,  Inc., 975 F.2d 1130, 1132 (5th Cir. 1992); Fed. R. Evid. 1004,  advisory committee's note (\"if failure to produce the original  is satisfactorily explained, secondary evidence is admissible\"). In particular, testimony regarding a regular business practice  can be sufficient to establish the existence and content of  missing business documents.  See, e.g., Simas v. First Citizen's  Fed. Credit Union, 170 F.3d 37, 52 (1st Cir. 1999) (relying on  testimony to establish the existence of missing loan  application); Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Glass, No. 94 Civ. 7375  (WK), 1997 WL 289858, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 30, 1997) (relying on  evidence of custom and practice to use standard engagement  letter to establish the existence and terms of missing  engagement letters).  The fact that the affidavit erroneously  stated that the application Beck signed contained an express  arbitration clause is not directly contradictory, as there is no  dispute that if Beck signed an application, it was Form A-300,  and the contents of that form are not in question.  Similarly,  the fact that the single page found of the incomplete 1996  amended registration form did not contain Beck's signature is  not persuasive in challenging NASD's business practices, as the  one page found was the first page of a three page application  form, and not the one on which NASD would have required an  actual signature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Beck was in fact registered with  NASD in 1968, and given the convincing evidence that he would  not have been registered without a signed Form A-300 in light of  NASD's business practices, the district court was not in error  to conclude that he had in fact signed and submitted the form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Voluntary and Knowing Agreement to Mandatory Arbitration</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck also contend that even if they at one  time agreed to be bound by NASD rules as they were \"adopted,  changed, or amended,\" this agreement is not sufficient to compel  them to submit to mandatory arbitration where the documents they  signed are silent as to arbitration.  Agreements to arbitrate,  they say, must be knowing and voluntary, and the forms they  (allegedly) signed did not contain any mandatory arbitration  provisions, much less one regarding employment disputes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck rely heavily on this court's opinion in Rosenberg v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 170  F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1999), to argue that the agreements that they  signed cannot serve to compel arbitration in the absence of  proof of more direct awareness of and consent to the arbitration  requirement.  However, Rosenberg is different from this case in  two respects.  First, Rosenberg was concerned only with  compelling arbitration in the context of federal employment  discrimination claims and relied in part on congressional  history expressing particular concerns on the issue of  arbitration arising out of the strong public policy against such  discrimination.  Id. at 17-21.  By contrast, this case involves  a straightforward contract dispute that does not raise the  public policy concerns addressed by statutory bars to employment  discrimination.  Moreover, the defendant in Rosenberg, Merrill  Lynch, had agreed expressly to familiarize its employees with  the governing regulations, and had not notified the plaintiff of  the mandatory arbitration provision.  Id. at 19.  Here Variable  made no such promise,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and therefore Rosenberg is inapposite on  this point as well.  Other courts have compelled arbitration on  similar agreements to abide by rules as modified in the future. See, e.g., R.J. O'Brien &amp; Assoc. v. Pipkin, 64 F.3d 257 (7th  Cir. 1995); Geldermann v. CFTC, 836 F.2d 310 (7th Cir. 1987). Zang and Beck are professionals who agreed to abide by the rules  and regulations of a professional organization to which they  belonged; in the absence of any commitment by the petitioners to  inform them of rule changes, they cannot plead ignorance of  rules with which they have agreed to comply to escape their  effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Denial of Discovery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck also challenge the district court's  denial of discovery regarding whether petitioners had cancelled  their NASD registrations through Variable before the accrual of  their employment claims.  Petitioners argue that the discovery  request was untimely and therefore waived; Zang and Beck respond  that they had a right to test the legal sufficiency of the  petition before pursuing factual disputes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve the question.  The only \"disputed\"  factual issue raised by Zang and Beck on appeal is the alleged  transfer of Zang and Beck's registration with NASD from Variable  to Washington Square Securities, Inc.  The district court denied  discovery on this question.  The essence of Zang and Beck's  theory is that if they were registered through Washington Square  and not through Variable, then Variable lacked standing to  compel arbitration.  However, NASD records before the district  court establish that Zang and Beck were still registered with  NASD through Variable at the time of the termination of their  employment.  Thus any question regarding their alleged  (additional) registration through Washington Square is  immaterial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Business Exception</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck's final argument is that their employment  claims against the petitioners fall outside the scope of the  NASD arbitration provisions because the NASD Code excepts from  arbitration \"disputes involving the insurance business of any  member which is also an insurance company.\"  NASD Code &#167; 1.  The  overwhelming weight of authority on the issue holds that  employment with an insurance company alone is not enough to  trigger the exception unless the pending claim is entangled with  the company's insurance business to a substantial degree, and we  hold that is the correct rule.  See, e.g., Armijo v. Prudential  Ins. Co. of America, 72 F.3d 793, 800 (10th Cir. 1995) (claims  of employment discrimination against insurance company did not  involve insurance business of defendant); Cular v. Metropolitan  Life Ins. Co., 961 F. Supp. 550, 558 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (breach of  contract and tort claims  in the case were \"garden-variety\"  employment disputes not covered by the insurance business  exception).  Since this dispute simply involves the obligations  of the companies to the managers under their employment  contracts and does not substantially implicate the conduct of  insurance business, the exception is inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's orders compelling  arbitration and denying the Rule 60(b) motion for relief from  that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fed.

This case involves strategic  decisions made by parties in an attempt to obtain a benefit from  a particular ruling; when the court issued a contrary order,  those parties attempted to reverse course and get the district  court to reach a different result under Rule 60(b), Fed. R. Civ.  P.  The district court was unsympathetic, and this appeal  followed.  Arthur F. Zang, Jr., and Harold P. Beck joined a  number of other employees in filing state employment actions  against six interrelated companies, including The Paul Revere  Variable Annuity Insurance Company (\"Variable\").  Variable,  alone among the six companies, is a member of the National  Association of Securities Dealers (\"NASD\").  Based on that  membership the companies sought to compel arbitration against  seventeen of the former employees by virtue of those employees'  registration with NASD.  Fifteen of the seventeen former  employees then voluntarily dismissed their claims against  Variable and continued their claims against the remaining five  companies; Zang and Beck remained steadfast and contested the  motions to compel arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the motions to compel  arbitration as to the fifteen employees who no longer had claims  against Variable and, after further argument, entered an order  compelling Zang and Beck to submit their claims against the six  companies to arbitration, finding that they both had entered  into enforceable arbitration agreements.  Faced with this court  order, Zang and Beck reversed course and decided to dismiss  their claims against Variable.  After doing so, they sought  relief from the district court's order under Rule 60(b), arguing  that the remaining five companies lacked standing on their own  to compel arbitration.  The district court declined to grant  relief from its order, and Zang and Beck now appeal both that  denial and the initial order.  We affirm both orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1997, Provident Companies, Inc. acquired The  Paul Revere Corporation.  As a result, Provident combined  effective control of its own wholly owned subsidiary, Provident  Life &amp; Accident Insurance Company, with control of The Paul  Revere Variable Annuity Insurance Company and The Paul Revere  Protective Life Insurance Company, two wholly owned subsidiaries  of The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company, which, in turn, was  a wholly owned subsidiary of The Paul Revere Corporation.  In  October 1997, a number of general managers for the Paul Revere  family of companies, alleging that the termination of their  employment was imminent with the completion of the acquisition,  filed separate but substantially similar breach of contract  actions in a Massachusetts trial court against all six of these  corporate entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a condition of their employment, seventeen of the  general managers, including Zang and Beck, had registered with  NASD and allegedly thereby promised to abide by NASD's rules and  regulations as they were from time to time amended.  At the time  that the employment actions were filed, the NASD Code mandated  arbitration of certain disputes if requested by a NASD member or  a person associated with a member.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on Variable's membership in NASD, the six  companies sought to compel arbitration of the dispute as to  those seventeen managers.  First, in January 1998 the  petitioners filed a motion to compel arbitration in the state  court, invoking the NASD Code, and asked the court to stay its  hand or dismiss the case pending arbitration.  Fifteen of the  managers then voluntarily dismissed their actions against  Variable (ultimately) with prejudice, removing the only  petitioner from their cases who was a NASD member; Zang and Beck  retained their claims against Variable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with the employees' objections to their motions,  in July 1998 the companies went to federal district court  seeking orders staying the state court actions and compelling  arbitration by all seventeen former employees, invoking the  Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. &#167; 1 et seq., and  resting jurisdiction on diversity, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a).  In  September 1999, the district court denied the petition to compel  arbitration as to those fifteen managers who had dismissed  Variable on the ground that the remaining petitioners, absent  Variable as a defendant, lacked standing under NASD's  arbitration protocol.  See Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins. Co. v. Thomas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2489206\"><a href=\"/opinion/2489206/paul-revere-variable-annuity-ins-co-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span>, 223-28 (D. Mass. 1999).  This  court upheld that denial.  See Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins.  Co. v. Kirschhofer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770357\"><a href=\"/opinion/770357/the-paul-revere-variable-annuity-insurance-company-v-maureen-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18-26 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the other fifteen managers, instead of  dismissing Variable, Zang and Beck opted to retain their claims  against Variable and contest the motion to compel arbitration on  the merits.  They did so, presumably, because their largest  dollar value claims were against Variable.  Specifically, Zang  and Beck (1) contested the existence of a binding agreement to  arbitrate, (2) contended that they lacked sufficient notice of  the amendments to NASD regulations requiring mandatory  arbitration to compel them to arbitrate their employment claims,  and (3) argued that, in any case, their claims fell outside the  scope of the NASD arbitration provision, both because they did  not sell securities and because the NASD Code provided an  exception from arbitration for insurance business.  In October  1999, after issuing its orders dismissing the petitions against  the other managers, the district court held a status conference  to determine the issues in dispute with regard to Zang and Beck. The court ordered further briefing and denied further discovery. On January 7, 2000, the court granted the petitions against Zang  and Beck and ordered the parties to arbitrate.  Zang and Beck  filed a timely appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 13, 2000, Zang and Beck dismissed their claims  against Variable with prejudice in the state court actions. They then moved the district court to amend its prior orders  under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), arguing that since they had  dismissed the claims against Variable, none of the remaining  parties had standing under the NASD arbitration protocol to  compel arbitration.  On September 26, 2000, the district court  summarily denied Zang and Beck's Rule 60(b) motions for relief  from final judgment.  Again Zang and Beck filed an appeal, and  this court consolidated the two appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Zang and Beck seek relief from the final order  of the district court compelling arbitration under Rule 60(b),  Fed. R. Civ. P., in light of their subsequent dismissal with  prejudice of their claims against Variable.  Rule 60(b) affords  district courts the equitable power to relieve a party from the  force of a final order or judgment under certain conditions  where necessary to serve the ends of justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Zang and Beck  argue that now that Variable is no longer a party to the ordered  arbitration, the remaining parties lack standing to compel  arbitration under the NASD arbitration protocol.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Therefore they  assert on appeal that Rule 60(b) relief is warranted both under  clause (5), because prospective application of the arbitration  order is, they say, \"no longer equitable,\" and under clause (6),  because the lack of standing of the remaining parties provides  a \"reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This effort faces two formidable hurdles.  First, Rule  60(b) relief is \"extraordinary relief\" reserved for \"exceptional  circumstances,\" given the countervailing interest in the  finality of such orders.  See United States v. One Urban Lot,  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527781\"><a href=\"/opinion/527781/united-states-v-one-urban-lot-etc-appeal-of-alicia-rivera-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span>, 585 (1st Cir. 1989) (internal quotation marks  omitted).  Moreover, the district court's decision to deny  relief under Rule 60(b) is, in turn, reviewed on appeal for  abuse of discretion.  See Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197458\"><a href=\"/opinion/197458/ahmed-v-rosenblatt/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 891  (1st Cir. 1997) (\"We will find an abuse of discretion [under  Rule 60(b)] only when we are left with a definite and firm  conviction that the lower court committed a clear error of  judgment . . . .\"), cert. denied <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></span> (1998).  Zang and  Beck fail to clear these considerable hurdles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 60(b)(6)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first five subsections of Rule 60(b) allow a court  to relieve a party from a final judgment on several specified  grounds, such as mistake or excusable neglect, newly discovered  evidence, or fraud.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule  60(b)(6) provides federal district courts with a residual  reservoir of equitable power to grant discretionary relief from  a final judgment for \"any other reason justifying relief . . .  .\"  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).  This residual catchall  provision allows a court to relieve a party from a final  judgment where such relief is appropriate to accomplish justice,  but the reasons for that relief are not encompassed by the other  provisions of the rule.  Zang and Beck argue that the fact that  the only petitioner with standing under the NASD Code to compel  arbitration (Variable) is no longer party to the case justifies  relief from the arbitration order issued by the district court. This is not necessarily so, and the district court did not abuse  its discretion in denying such relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District courts should grant Rule 60(b)(6) motions  \"only where exceptional circumstances justifying extraordinary  relief exist.\"  Ahmed, 118 F.3d at 891, citing Valley Citizens  for a Safe Environment v. Aldridge, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587247\"><a href=\"/opinion/587247/valley-citizens-for-a-safe-environment-v-edward-c-aldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1315</span></a></span>, 1317 (1st  Cir. 1992).  District courts have \"broad discretion\" to  determine whether such circumstances exist.  Valley Citizens,  969 F.2d at 1317.  The bar for such relief is set high because,  as the Supreme Court noted in Ackermann v. United States, 340  U.S. 193,198 (1950), \"[t]here must be an end to litigation  someday . . .,\" and therefore district courts must weigh the  reasons advanced for reopening the judgment against the desire  to achieve finality in litigation.  E.g. Lussier v. Dugger, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542407\"><a href=\"/opinion/542407/maurice-g-lussier-v-richard-dugger-as-secretary-of-the-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span>, 667 (11th Cir. 1990); see also 11 Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2857, at 256-57 (West 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasons for relief advanced by Zang and Beck are  not so compelling as to require the district court to grant  their Rule 60(b) motion.  The decision to persevere in their  claims against Variable upon the filing of the petitions to  compel arbitration in federal court was a \"free, calculated, and  deliberate\" choice.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  The only  relevant change in circumstance since the entry of the  arbitration order is Zang and Beck's also \"free, calculated, and  deliberate\" choice to dismiss Variable from their state court  actions.  Ordinarily, the discretionary power granted by Rule  60(b)(6) is not for the purpose of relieving a party from such  \"free, calculated, and deliberate\" choices made as part of a  strategy of litigation.  E.g. id. (\"free, calculated, deliberate  choices are not to be relieved from\"); see also id. at 200  (stating that \"by no stretch of the imagination can the  voluntary, deliberate, free, untrammeled choice by the  petitioner not to appeal\" compare with the \"exceptional  circumstances\" found in other cases); 11 Wright et al., supra &#167;  2864, at 359.  The law presumes that parties will make choices  to protect their legal interests, even though those choices may  at times involve a calculated risk.  Where a party makes a  considered choice, though it may involve some calculated risk,  he \"cannot be relieved of such a choice because hindsight seems  to indicate to him\" that, as it turns out, his decision was  \"probably wrong.\"  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck are correct that the facts of Ackermann are different -- that case involved a decision not to pursue an  appeal.  But still, the policy embodied in Ackermann applies  with equal force in this case.  Zang and Beck persisted in their  claim against Variable, cognizant of the risk that this would  lead to mandatory arbitration.  Indeed, by the time of the  October 1999 status conference, the September dismissals of the  petitions against the other fifteen managers made clear that it  was reasonably likely that this consequence could be avoided by  dismissing Variable.  Nonetheless Zang and Beck continued to  litigate against the petitions to compel arbitration rather than  dismissing Variable, gambling that they could defeat those  petitions on the merits.  Only upon the district court's order  compelling arbitration did Zang and Beck opt to dismiss  Variable, hoping thereby to evade the arbitration order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck chose to retain their claim against  Variable, fully aware that this choice increased the likelihood  that they would be compelled to arbitrate their claims.  Now  that this likelihood has been borne out, they cannot reverse the  consequences of their decision after the fact by suddenly  changing course and then asking the district court to correct  for their earlier improvident choice.  Rather, the rule  contemplates that a party will take the legal steps necessary to  protect his own interests, and instead acts to relieve a party  from extraordinary predicaments where, because of exceptional  circumstances, the party would have been unable to do so.  The  district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief on  the grounds here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 60(b)(5)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Zang and Beck also argue that their Rule  60(b) motion falls within the fifth clause of the rule, which  allows a court to relieve parties from judgments with  prospective effect where, inter alia, \"it is no longer equitable  that the judgment should have prospective application.\"  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 60(b)(5).  Petitioners contend that Zang and Beck failed  to argue adequately before the district court that their case  fell within the scope of this provision, and that therefore the  argument is waived.  Zang and Beck respond that they did raise  the argument, and in any event they say that motions under Rule  60(b) need not specifically reference a particular subsection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach the waiver question because it is  clear that Zang and Beck do not qualify for relief under Rule  60(b)(5). As an initial matter, Zang and Beck's claims fall far  outside the cases with which the provision is particularly  concerned, such as institutional reform litigation, where,  because the decree involves the long-term supervision of  changing conduct or conditions, its prospective requirements may  be rendered inappropriate by unforeseen changes in circumstance  subsequent to the entry of the order.  See, e.g., Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, 379 (1992)  (suggesting a flexible standard is required for decrees that  involve \"the supervision of changing conduct or conditions\" and  thus of necessity are \"provisional and tentative\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to indulge in respondents' favor the  argument that the arbitration order falls within the scope of  Rule 60(b)(5), qualifying for relief under this provision  requires a clear showing of inequity.  Historically, the  standard for relief from a binding decree was quite high.  E.g. United States v. Swift &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101912\"><a href=\"/opinion/101912/united-states-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 119 (1932) (\"No  doubt the defendants will be better off if the injunction is  relaxed, but they are not suffering hardship so extreme and  unexpected as to justify us in saying that they are the victims  of oppression.  Nothing less than a clear showing of a grievous  wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead us to  change what was decreed . . . .\"); see also 11 Wright et al., supra, &#167; 2863, at 340-41.  It is true the Supreme Court has  acknowledged that greater flexibility is required in considering  requests to modify institutional reform consent decrees.  See Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. at 383. Nonetheless this court has since required a considerable showing  to modify decrees in private contractual disputes that lack  substantial bearing on the public interest.  See Alexis Lichine  &amp; Cie v. Sasha A. Lichine Estate Selections, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195873\"><a href=\"/opinion/195873/lichine-cie-v-lichine-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span>,  586-87 (1st Cir. 1995) (describing the continuum of cases in  which Rule 60(b)(5) is invoked).  In considering the equities of  such a modification, a court should look to such factors as the  circumstances leading to the decree, the level of hardship on  the \"burdened\" party, and the extent to which the change in  circumstances falls outside of those contemplated at the time  the decree was issued.  The order here resolved a contractual  dispute between private parties with tenuous and tangential  bearing at best on the public interest; the hardship of mandated  arbitration is limited; and the change of circumstances lay  fully within the control of (and, indeed, was caused by) the  parties requesting relief.  Such facts fail to demonstrate the  type of inequity to warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck argue that a change in facts justifying  relief from the prospective effect of a final order under Rule  60(b)(5) need not be \"unforeseen and unforeseeable.\" This  assertion is correct.  See Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County  Jail, 502 U.S. at 385.  From this assertion Zang and Beck reason  by implication that Rule 60(b)(5) relief is appropriate here,  where the circumstances at issue were within their control both  before and after the issuance of the district court's order. But there is considerable distance between facts that were  completely unforeseen when an order was issued and those  circumstances that were in both the control and contemplation of  the parties, both before and at the time of the judgment; the  line was not extended so far in Rufo.  Cf. id. (\"Litigants are  not required to anticipate every exigency that could conceivably  arise during the life of a consent decree.  Ordinarily, however,  modification should not be granted where a party relies upon  events that actually were anticipated at the time it entered  into a decree.\").  Rather, the policy underlying Ackermann    that parties must live with the consequences of freely made,  calculated decisions reached for strategic reasons in the course  of litigation --  applies with equal force in the context of  Rule 60(b)(5).  See, e.g., Valentine Sugars, Inc. v. Sudan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677351\"><a href=\"/opinion/677351/valentine-sugars-inc-valentine-sugars-inc-v-krishan-k-sudan-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span>, 322 (5th Cir. 1994) (holding that Rule 60(b)(5) relief  is not appropriate where the party not only foresaw the changed  conditions but created them).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these circumstances, Zang and Beck are not entitled  to relief from the district court's order under either  subsection (5) or (6) of Rule 60(b).  They are not free to test  the waters, fully litigating the merits of the arbitration  petition in the district court, and then, displeased with the  outcome, to escape the consequences of this choice by shifting  to a different course after the fact.  The orders are binding,  and the circumstances are not so exceptional or unforeseen as to  compel the district court to relieve the parties from their  force.  Any \"injustice\" wrought by these orders, if it exists at  all, is not so extreme -- Zang and Beck retain a right to pursue  their claims on the merits in the pending arbitration  proceedings and receive compensation if they prevail, even if  this is not their preferred forum or format.  Finding no abuse  of discretion, we affirm the district court's denial of the Rule  60(b) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck also raise four challenges to the  district court's initial determination granting the petition and  ordering arbitration.  First, Beck contends that petitioners  failed to present sufficient evidence of the existence of any  agreement to arbitrate.  Next, Zang and Beck argue that there  was no knowing and voluntary agreement to mandatory arbitration. Zang and Beck also contend that they were denied discovery about  material issues of fact in dispute regarding the continued  standing of Variable to compel arbitration.  Finally, Zang and  Beck contend that even if the NASD arbitration provisions bound  them to arbitrate some disputes, the insurance business  exception in the NASD Code exempted these particular disputes  from mandatory arbitration.  We review the district court's  grant of the motion to compel arbitration de novo.  See Bank v. Int'l Bus. Machines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197058\"><a href=\"/opinion/197058/bank-v-ibmc/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Existence of an Agreement to Arbitrate</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Beck claims that the petitioners failed to prove  the existence of any signed agreement on his part in which he  agreed to arbitration.  NASD records indicate that Beck's  registration was filed and approved on November 21, 1968. However, the NASD has not located an actual registration form  signed by Beck in 1968.  Nevertheless, the district court  concluded that Beck had signed the relevant forms, relying on  secondary evidence.  Petitioners filed with the court an  affidavit from a NASD official containing the following  assertions: (1) that NASD records show that Beck's registration  was both filed and approved on November 21, 1968; (2) that when  Beck registered in November 1968, NASD required registrants to  sign a registration application as part of its regular business  practice; and (3) that despite reasonable efforts, NASD had  failed to locate Beck's application forms.  The parties do not  dispute that the relevant registration form at the time was Form  A-300, and petitioners also introduced a copy of Form A-300. Beck states only that he does not recall signing the  application, and does not contend that the form was lost in bad  faith or contest that he was in fact registered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, the district court concluded that beck  had signed and submitted Form A-300, in which he agreed to be  bound by any NASD rules as they existed at the time he  registered and \"as they may from time to time be adopted,  changed, or amended.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As a result, the district court concluded  that Beck had agreed to be bound by the NASD rules in effect  when he filed suit in October 1997, which at the time required  arbitration of employment disputes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Beck argues that the district court erred  in finding this evidence sufficient to conclude that he had  actually signed Form A-300.  Beck says that the absence of any  testimony regarding personal knowledge that Beck had signed the  form, the failure to provide any explanation for the absence of  the form from the NASD's files, the fact that the NASD affidavit  contains the admittedly false statement that Beck's application  contained an express arbitration provision, and the fact that  the one partial  registration document NASD did produce  regarding Beck -- the face page of an amended registration form,  Form U-4, from 1996 -- did not contain Beck's signature but  instead that of another Variable employee, all militate against  the district court's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reliance on secondary evidence is  appropriate.  See, e.g., Bituminous Cas. Corp. v. Vacuum Tanks,  Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591155\"><a href=\"/opinion/591155/bituminous-casualty-corporation-v-vacuum-tanks-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1130</span></a></span>, 1132 (5th Cir. 1992); Fed. R. Evid. 1004,  advisory committee's note (\"if failure to produce the original  is satisfactorily explained, secondary evidence is admissible\"). In particular, testimony regarding a regular business practice  can be sufficient to establish the existence and content of  missing business documents.  See, e.g., Simas v. First Citizen's  Fed. Credit Union, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762262\"><a href=\"/opinion/762262/victor-e-simas-v-first-citizens-federal-credit-union-and-barbara-mw/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir. 1999) (relying on  testimony to establish the existence of missing loan  application); Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Glass, No. 94 Civ. 7375  (WK), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">289858</span></span>, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 30, 1997) (relying on  evidence of custom and practice to use standard engagement  letter to establish the existence and terms of missing  engagement letters).  The fact that the affidavit erroneously  stated that the application Beck signed contained an express  arbitration clause is not directly contradictory, as there is no  dispute that if Beck signed an application, it was Form A-300,  and the contents of that form are not in question.  Similarly,  the fact that the single page found of the incomplete 1996  amended registration form did not contain Beck's signature is  not persuasive in challenging NASD's business practices, as the  one page found was the first page of a three page application  form, and not the one on which NASD would have required an  actual signature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Beck was in fact registered with  NASD in 1968, and given the convincing evidence that he would  not have been registered without a signed Form A-300 in light of  NASD's business practices, the district court was not in error  to conclude that he had in fact signed and submitted the form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Voluntary and Knowing Agreement to Mandatory Arbitration</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck also contend that even if they at one  time agreed to be bound by NASD rules as they were \"adopted,  changed, or amended,\" this agreement is not sufficient to compel  them to submit to mandatory arbitration where the documents they  signed are silent as to arbitration.  Agreements to arbitrate,  they say, must be knowing and voluntary, and the forms they  (allegedly) signed did not contain any mandatory arbitration  provisions, much less one regarding employment disputes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck rely heavily on this court's opinion in Rosenberg v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762261\"><a href=\"/opinion/762261/75-empl-prac-dec-p-45823-22-employee-benefits-cas-2980-susan-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1999), to argue that the agreements that they  signed cannot serve to compel arbitration in the absence of  proof of more direct awareness of and consent to the arbitration  requirement.  However, Rosenberg is different from this case in  two respects.  First, Rosenberg was concerned only with  compelling arbitration in the context of federal employment  discrimination claims and relied in part on congressional  history expressing particular concerns on the issue of  arbitration arising out of the strong public policy against such  discrimination.  Id. at 17-21.  By contrast, this case involves  a straightforward contract dispute that does not raise the  public policy concerns addressed by statutory bars to employment  discrimination.  Moreover, the defendant in Rosenberg, Merrill  Lynch, had agreed expressly to familiarize its employees with  the governing regulations, and had not notified the plaintiff of  the mandatory arbitration provision.  Id. at 19.  Here Variable  made no such promise,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and therefore Rosenberg is inapposite on  this point as well.  Other courts have compelled arbitration on  similar agreements to abide by rules as modified in the future. See, e.g., R.J. O'Brien &amp; Assoc. v. Pipkin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702558\"><a href=\"/opinion/702558/rj-obrien-assoc-inc-v-thomas-d-pipkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span> (7th  Cir. 1995); Geldermann v. CFTC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499483\"><a href=\"/opinion/499483/geldermann-inc-and-board-of-trade-of-the-city-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span> (7th Cir. 1987). Zang and Beck are professionals who agreed to abide by the rules  and regulations of a professional organization to which they  belonged; in the absence of any commitment by the petitioners to  inform them of rule changes, they cannot plead ignorance of  rules with which they have agreed to comply to escape their  effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Denial of Discovery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck also challenge the district court's  denial of discovery regarding whether petitioners had cancelled  their NASD registrations through Variable before the accrual of  their employment claims.  Petitioners argue that the discovery  request was untimely and therefore waived; Zang and Beck respond  that they had a right to test the legal sufficiency of the  petition before pursuing factual disputes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve the question.  The only \"disputed\"  factual issue raised by Zang and Beck on appeal is the alleged  transfer of Zang and Beck's registration with NASD from Variable  to Washington Square Securities, Inc.  The district court denied  discovery on this question.  The essence of Zang and Beck's  theory is that if they were registered through Washington Square  and not through Variable, then Variable lacked standing to  compel arbitration.  However, NASD records before the district  court establish that Zang and Beck were still registered with  NASD through Variable at the time of the termination of their  employment.  Thus any question regarding their alleged  (additional) registration through Washington Square is  immaterial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Business Exception</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zang and Beck's final argument is that their employment  claims against the petitioners fall outside the scope of the  NASD arbitration provisions because the NASD Code excepts from  arbitration \"disputes involving the insurance business of any  member which is also an insurance company.\"  NASD Code &#167; 1.  The  overwhelming weight of authority on the issue holds that  employment with an insurance company alone is not enough to  trigger the exception unless the pending claim is entangled with  the company's insurance business to a substantial degree, and we  hold that is the correct rule.  See, e.g., Armijo v. Prudential  Ins. Co. of America, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710105\"><a href=\"/opinion/710105/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1544-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43870-jake-armijo/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span>, 800 (10th Cir. 1995) (claims  of employment discrimination against insurance company did not  involve insurance business of defendant); Cular v. Metropolitan  Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2283255\"><a href=\"/opinion/2283255/cular-v-metropolitan-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></a></span>, 558 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (breach of  contract and tort claims  in the case were \"garden-variety\"  employment disputes not covered by the insurance business  exception).  Since this dispute simply involves the obligations  of the companies to the managers under their employment  contracts and does not substantially implicate the conduct of  insurance business, the exception is inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's orders compelling  arbitration and denying the Rule 60(b) motion for relief from  that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fed.

Not only is  jurisdictional standing assessed in terms of the circumstances  at the time the action is filed, see Lujan v.

Instead, the  question properly conceived is what entities have a right under  the NASD arbitration protocols to compel arbitration, and  whether that \"standing\" persists upon the dismissal of Variable.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Petitioners did produce the form Zang signed when he  registered in 1974, Form B-301, in which he likewise agreed to  be bound by all NASD regulations as they existed and are  \"adopted, changed, or amended.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> While Zang and Beck argue that NASD Rule 3010 reflects  a commitment by Variable to notify them of changes in the NASD  Code, this is simply not the case.

Rule 3010 does not reach the adoption of mandatory  arbitration for employment disputes, which falls beyond the area  of securities regulation with which Rule 3010 is concerned.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
