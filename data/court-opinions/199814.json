Watt, Jr. on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret E.

This appeal requires us to\n\naddress,    for     the    first   time,    a       question    endemic    to     the\n\nsentencing of deportable aliens convicted of federal criminal\n\noffenses:     Do     the    adverse   collateral        consequences       that    an\n\nincarcerated defendant may experience by reason of his status as\n\na deportable alien collectively constitute a permissible ground\n\nfor a downward departure under USSG §5K2.0?                      With regard to\n\nillegal reentry cases in which sentence is imposed pursuant to\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) and USSG §2L1.2, we answer that question in\n\nthe negative.       That answer, in turn, prompts us to affirm the\n\nsentence imposed in this case.\n\n            The facts are straightforward.                In 1991, defendant-\n\nappellant    Romulo       Emilio   Vasquez,     a    Dominican    national,       was\n\nconvicted in a Rhode Island state court of assault with a\n\ndangerous weapon.          The Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\n(INS) deported him after he had served a term of immurement.\n\nThe appellant thereafter returned illegally to the United States\n\nand again ran afoul of local law enforcement.                  This time, he was\n\narrested for, and convicted of, trafficking in cocaine.\n\n            These    transgressions        brought     the     appellant    to    the\n\nrenewed attention of the INS.              On November 8, 2000, a federal\n\ngrand jury handed up an indictment charging that the appellant,\n\na previously-deported alien, had been found in Rhode Island\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fwithout having obtained the consent of the Attorney General to\n\nreapply    for     admission    into    the     United     States,   and   that,\n\ntherefore, he had violated 8 U.S.C. § 1326. 1                   The appellant\n\npleaded guilty to that charge (which we shall call \"illegal\n\nreentry\").\n\n            The    principal     sentencing      guideline     applicable      to\n\nillegal reentry cases is USSG §2L1.2 (governing, inter alia,\n\nunlawful    reentry    into     the    United    States     after    a   previous\n\ndeportation).       The parties agree that this guideline controls,\n\nand that, under it, the appellant faced a sentencing range of 46\n\nto   57   months    (adjusted    offense      level   21;    criminal     history\n\ncategory III).      At the disposition hearing, the appellant sought\n\na downward departure on the ground that, as a deportable alien,\n\nhe would suffer certain adverse collateral consequences during\n\nhis incarceration (e.g., he claimed that he would be ineligible\n\nfor assignment to a minimum-security prison camp or for certain\n\nrehabilitative programs offered by the Bureau of Prisons).                    The\n\ndistrict court refused to oblige, concluding that it lacked\n\nauthority     to    depart      on    the     basis   of     such    collateral\n\n\n      1\n     With exceptions not relevant here, the statute of\nconviction provides that any alien who, after having been\ndeported, \"enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found\nin, the United States\" without the Attorney General's express\nconsent to apply for his readmission shall be guilty of a\nfederal crime and punished as provided by law.     8 U.S.C. §\n1326(a)(2).\n\n                                       -4-\n\fconsequences.   The court thereupon sentenced the appellant at\n\nthe bottom of the guideline sentencing range.              This appeal\n\nensued.\n\n          Appellate   review   of    a   sentencing   court's   decision\n\ngranting a departure is for abuse of discretion.         Koon v. United\n\nStates, 518 U.S. 81, 98-100 (1996); United States v. Snyder, 136\n\nF.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir. 1998).        Conversely, a sentencing court's\n\ndecision not to depart is largely unreviewable.             See United\n\nStates v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994).         There are,\n\nhowever, a few exceptions to this rule.         One exception is for\n\ncases in which the sentencing court's refusal to depart stems\n\nfrom a misperception of its authority under the law.            See id.;\n\nsee also United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146, 148 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (explaining that appellate jurisdiction lies if \"the\n\nputative appellant can show that the district court acted in the\n\nmistaken belief that it lacked the ability to depart\").              The\n\nquestion of whether the guidelines countenance a particular\n\nground for departure goes to the district court's authority,\n\nand, thus, is reviewable.      Because the resultant question is a\n\nquestion of law, Koon, 518 U.S. at 100, we subject the district\n\ncourt's determination that it lacked authority to depart to de\n\nnovo review and proceed to \"determine the existence vel non of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\flegal error without special deference to the sentencing court's\n\nviews,\" Snyder, 136 F.3d at 67.\n\n           In this instance, the departure request had its genesis\n\nin the sentencing guidelines' general departure provision, USSG\n\n§5K2.0.    Echoing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b), that provision empowers\n\nthe sentencing court to deviate from the guideline sentencing\n\nrange \"if the court finds that there exists an aggravating or\n\nmitigating      circumstance        of    a     kind,    or    to    a     degree,    not\n\nadequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission\n\nin formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence\n\ndifferent from that described.\"                   USSG §5K2.0 (citation and\n\ninternal       quotation     marks       omitted).        Even       so,    not   every\n\naggravating or mitigating circumstance has the capability of\n\nsupporting       a   departure:            to    serve        that    purpose,       \"the\n\ncircumstance must render the case atypical and take it out of\n\nthe heartland for which the applicable guideline was designed.\"\n\nUnited States v.       Dethlefs, 123 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Here,     the     appellant's        case    hinges       on    whether   the\n\nsentencing court correctly concluded that the guidelines did not\n\npermit    it    to   honor    the    appellant's         identified         ground    for\n\ndeparture.      We turn, then, to an evaluation of that conclusion.\n\nIn conducting that evaluation, our inquiry centers on whether\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fthe identified ground for departure — the feature on which the\n\nappellant relies to distinguish his case from the mine-run —\n\n\"potentially,         take[s]   [the     case]       outside      the    Guidelines'\n\n'heartland,'\" thus \"mak[ing] of it a special, or unusual, case.\"\n\nKoon, 518 U.S. at 95 (quoting United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d\n\n942, 949 (1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n             The distinguishing feature identified by the appellant\n\nhere is the panoply of adverse collateral penal consequences\n\nthat flow from his deportable status.                  Because the sentencing\n\nguidelines never mention this incident of the incarceration of\n\nan alien convicted of an illegal reentry, the question reduces\n\nto    whether   the    Sentencing      Commission      nevertheless        took   the\n\nidentified feature into account in its formulation (and if so,\n\nto    what   end).      Dethlefs,      123    F.3d    at    44.     To   solve    this\n\nconundrum, we must consider whether that feature suffices to\n\nremove a case from the heartland established by the guidelines\n\nas they apply to the offense of conviction.                       Koon, 518 U.S. at\n\n95; Dethlefs, 123 F.3d at 44.           We perform this task mindful that\n\nthe    Court    has    predicted    that      departures       premised     on    such\n\nunmentioned circumstances will be rare.                    Koon, 518 U.S. at 95.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f            Because this is an illegal reentry case — and we limit\n\nour holding accordingly2 — this question implicates the theory\n\nand structure of USSG §2L1.2.              That guideline covers offenses\n\ninvolving    persons     who    unlawfully      enter   into,   or    unlawfully\n\nremain in, the United States.              By definition, then, the only\n\npersons    sentenced     under    that     guideline    will    be    deportable\n\naliens.    This fact is nose-on-the-face plain, and the Sentencing\n\nCommission, in constructing the guideline, must have taken into\n\naccount not only the immigration status of prospective offenders\n\nbut also the collateral consequences that would flow from that\n\nstatus within the federal prison system.                   This is powerful\n\nevidence    that   the      distinguishing       feature    upon      which   the\n\nappellant    relies    is      outside    the   compass    of   the    departure\n\ndecision.\n\n            The case law bears out this intuition.               Although the\n\nappellant's argument is new to us, it is not new to the federal\n\nappellate courts as a whole.              An unbroken line of cases holds\n\n\n    2One court has indicated that a downward departure \"may be\nappropriate where the defendant's status as a deportable alien\nis likely to cause a fortuitous increase in the severity of his\nsentence.\" United States v. Smith, 27 F.3d 649, 655 (D.C. Cir.\n1994).   But Smith involved a sentence imposed for a drug-\ntrafficking offense rather than for an illegal reentry offense.\nFor the reasons explicated in the text, illegal reentry cases\nare functionally different as they pertain to this point.\nHence, this case does not require us to take a view as to the\ncontinuing vitality of the Smith court's holding (which, in all\nevents, antedated Koon).\n\n                                         -8-\n\fthat where, as here, a defendant is sentenced under USSG §2L1.2\n\nfollowing his conviction for an illegal reentry offense, adverse\n\ncollateral penal consequences of the type and kind feared by the\n\nappellant are not a cognizable basis for a downward departure.\n\nSee United States v. Martinez-Carillo, 250 F.3d 1101, 1106-07\n\n(7th Cir.), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 285 (2001); United States\n\nv. Cardosa-Rodriguez, 241 F.3d 613, 614 (8th Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v. Garay, 235 F.3d 230, 232-34 (5th Cir. 2000), cert.\n\ndenied, 121 S. Ct. 1633 (2001); United States v. Martinez-Ramos,\n\n184 F.3d 1055, 1057-59 (9th Cir. 1999); United States v. Ebolum,\n\n72 F.3d 35, 37-39 (6th Cir. 1995).\n\n          These decisions rest on bedrock.           Deportable alien\n\nstatus is a universal concomitant of crimes such as illegal\n\nreentry, and, thus, common sense dictates that such status must\n\nhave been weighed by the Sentencing Commission in formulating\n\nUSSG §2L1.2 and setting the attendant offense levels.              This\n\nmeans, of course, that far from being a special, unusual, or\n\natypical feature of an illegal reentry case, susceptibility to\n\ndeportation is a common thread that runs through all such cases.\n\nWithout   more,   this   circumstance   (and,   by    extension,    the\n\ncollateral consequences that flow from it) is insufficient to\n\ntake an illegal reentry case out of the heartland associated\n\nwith USSG §2L1.2.\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f          If further support for this conclusion is needed — and\n\nwe doubt that it is — we note that our resolution of this\n\nquestion is foreshadowed by our earlier decision in United\n\nStates v. Clase-Espinal, 115 F.3d 1054 (1st Cir. 1997).                There,\n\nthe defendant argued (and the district court agreed) that his\n\nwillingness to stipulate to deportability was an appropriate\n\nbasis on which to depart downward.            Id. at 1057.      We reversed,\n\nconcluding that the Sentencing Commission must have known that\n\nmany of those persons sentenced for criminal offenses in the\n\nfederal courts are deportable aliens.              Id. at 1057-58.     Thus,\n\nthe Commission must have been \"fully cognizant that virtually\n\nall   alien   criminal    defendants,       convicted   under   8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1326(a) and sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2, would be\n\nsubject to deportation and that many undoubtedly would stipulate\n\nto deportation.\"    Id. at 1059.      Based on this reasoning, we held\n\nthat the defendant's willingness to accede to deportation was\n\nnot a sufficiently atypical circumstance to justify a downward\n\ndeparture (at least in the absence of a colorable defense to\n\ndeportation).    Id.\n\n          The case at bar is a fair congener.                We think it is\n\nequally certain that the Sentencing Commission realized that all\n\npersons   convicted      under   8   U.S.C.    §   1326(a)   and    sentenced\n\npursuant to USSG § 2L1.2 would be deportable (and, thus, subject\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fto certain disadvantages within the federal prison system).               It\n\nfollows inexorably that the Commission must have taken that\n\nfactor into account in framing the relevant guidelines.\n\n          The appellant has two rejoinders. First, he notes that\n\nboth the statute of conviction, 8 U.S.C. § 1326, and the pivotal\n\nguideline, USSG §2L1.2, refer to aliens who have previously been\n\ndeported (that is, they speak only in the past tense) and do not\n\nrefer to an alien's present status.         He seizes upon this usage\n\nto suggest the obvious:         that having been deported in the past\n\nis not necessarily the same as being presently deportable.               For\n\nour   purposes,    however,     this   is   a   distinction    without     a\n\ndifference:       since   the    appellant's    present   status    as     a\n\ndeportable alien flows ineluctably from his previous deportation\n\n(coupled, of course, with his subsequent unlawful reentry into\n\nthe United States), the past and present merge.               Put another\n\nway, the appellant's status as a deportable alien is an inherent\n\nelement of the crime that he committed and to which both the\n\nstatute and the guideline apply, and so this element must have\n\nbeen taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in\n\nconstructing USSG §2L1.2.        See Martinez-Ramos, 184 F.3d at 1058;\n\nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Portillo, 121 F.3d 1122, 1124-25 (7th\n\nCir. 1997).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f            Second, the appellant argues that if the sentencing\n\nguidelines do not expressly forbid downward departures based on\n\na particular circumstance, the district court must necessarily\n\nbe authorized to depart on the basis of that circumstance.\n\nBuilding on this shaky foundation, he posits that because the\n\nSentencing       Commission   eschewed        any    mention       of   the   adverse\n\ncollateral penal consequences attendant to deportable status,\n\nthat circumstance must be a lawful basis for departure.                          We do\n\nnot agree with either the appellant's premise or his conclusion.\n\n            The    Supreme    Court    has    made    it     crystal     clear    that\n\nimpermissible bases for departure need not be invoked by name in\n\nthe sentencing guidelines.            Koon, 518 U.S. at 110.              Forbidden\n\nfactors may be implicit as well as explicit.                    United States v.\n\nTappin, 205 F.3d 536, 542 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 910\n\n(2000).      Substantial      case     law     emanating       from     this     court\n\nsubsequent to Koon validates this point.                   E.g., United States v.\n\nMaldonado, 242 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that the\n\ncost   of   incarcerating      a   defendant         who    will    ultimately        be\n\ndeported    is    categorically       excluded      from     consideration       as    a\n\nlawful basis for a downward departure); Snyder, 136 F.3d at 68\n\n(holding that even though the Sentencing Commission has not\n\nproscribed federal-state sentencing disparity as a ground for\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fdeparture, that circumstance \"is never a valid basis for a\n\ndownward departure\"); Dethlefs, 123 F.3d at 49 (holding that the\n\nfact of a straight guilty plea, without more, is categorically\n\nexcluded, by implication, as a basis for a downward departure);\n\nClase-Espinal, 115 F.3d at 1060 (holding that willingness to\n\nstipulate to deportation is categorically excluded as a ground\n\nfor departure).\n\n          To sum up, the ground for departure advocated by the\n\nappellant is insufficient as a matter of law to distinguish his\n\ncase from the mine-run of illegal reentry offenses subject to\n\nthe strictures of USSG §2L1.2.           If the law were otherwise, then\n\nevery defendant in an illegal reentry case automatically would\n\nqualify for such a departure, thus emptying the \"heartland\"\n\nconcept   of    its    essential    meaning.       We    cannot       place   our\n\nimprimatur upon so counterintuitive a result.\n\n          We need go no further.              We hold that in the case of\n\ndefendants     sentenced   for     illegal     reentry   under    8    U.S.C.   §\n\n1326(a)   and   USSG    §2L1.2,    a    district   court   may    not    depart\n\ndownward on the basis that deportable status ostensibly carries\n\nwith it certain adverse collateral penal consequences.3                 Because\n\n\n    3We do not reach (and, therefore, express no opinion on) the\nissue of whether a deportable alien does, in fact, suffer\nadverse penal consequences simply by virtue of his status.

With regard to illegal reentry cases in which sentence is imposed pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) and USSG &#167; 2L1.2, we answer that question in the negative. That answer, in turn, prompts us to affirm the sentence imposed in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are straightforward. In 1991, defendant-appellant Romulo Emilio Vasquez, a Dominican national, was convicted in a Rhode Island state court of assault with a dangerous weapon. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) deported him after he had served a term of immurement. The appellant thereafter returned illegally to the United States and again ran afoul of local law enforcement. This time, he was arrested for, and convicted of, trafficking in cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These transgressions brought the appellant to the renewed attention of the INS. On November 8, 2000, a federal grand jury handed up an indictment charging that the appellant, a previously-deported alien, had been found in Rhode Island without having obtained the consent of the Attorney General to reapply for admission into the United States, and that, therefore, he had violated 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The appellant pleaded guilty to that charge (which we shall call \"illegal reentry\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal sentencing guideline applicable to illegal reentry cases is USSG &#167; 2L1.2 (governing, inter alia, unlawful reentry into the United States after a previous deportation). The parties agree that this guideline controls, and that, under it, the appellant faced a sentencing range of 46 to 57 months (adjusted offense level 21; criminal history category III). At the disposition hearing, the appellant sought a downward departure on the ground that, as a deportable alien, he would suffer certain adverse collateral consequences during his incarceration (e.g., he claimed that he would be ineligible for assignment to a minimum-security prison camp or for certain rehabilitative programs offered by the Bureau of Prisons). The district court refused to oblige, concluding that it lacked authority to depart on the basis of such collateral consequences. The court thereupon sentenced the appellant at the bottom of the guideline sentencing range. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review of a sentencing court's decision granting a departure is for abuse of discretion. <i>Koon v. United States,</i> 518 U.S. 81, 98-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996); <i>United States v. Snyder,</i> 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir.1998). Conversely, a sentencing court's decision not to depart is largely unreviewable. <i>See United States v. Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir.1994). There are, however, a few exceptions to this rule. One exception is for cases in which the sentencing court's refusal to depart stems from a misperception of its authority under the law. <i>See id.; see also United States v. Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d 146, 148 (1st Cir.2000) (explaining that appellate jurisdiction lies if \"the putative appellant can show that the district court acted in the mistaken belief that it lacked the ability to depart\"). The question of whether the guidelines countenance a particular ground for departure goes to the district court's authority, and, thus, is reviewable. Because the resultant question is a question of law, <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, we subject the district court's determination that it lacked authority to depart to de novo review and proceed to \"determine the existence <i>vel non</i> of legal error without special deference to the sentencing court's views,\" <i>Snyder,</i> 136 F.3d at 67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the departure request had its genesis in the sentencing guidelines' general departure provision, USSG &#167; 5K2.0. Echoing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b), that provision empowers the sentencing court to deviate from the guideline sentencing range \"if the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\" USSG &#167; 5K2.0 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Even so, not every aggravating or mitigating circumstance has the capability of supporting a departure: to serve that purpose, \"the circumstance must render the case atypical and take it out of the heartland for which the applicable guideline was designed.\" <i>United States v. Dethlefs,</i> 123 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir.1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appellant's case hinges on whether the sentencing court correctly concluded that the guidelines did not permit it to honor the appellant's identified ground for departure. We turn, then, to an evaluation of that conclusion. In conducting that evaluation, our inquiry centers on whether the identified ground for departure &#8212; the feature on which the appellant relies to distinguish his case from the mine-run &#8212; \"potentially, take[s] [the case] outside the Guidelines' `heartland,'\" thus \"mak[ing] of it a special, or unusual, case.\" <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 95, 116 S.Ct. 2035 (quoting <i>United States v. Rivera,</i> 994 F.2d 942, 949 (1st Cir.1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distinguishing feature identified by the appellant here is the panoply of adverse collateral penal consequences that flow from his deportable status. Because the sentencing guidelines never mention this incident of the incarceration of an alien convicted of an illegal reentry, the question reduces to whether the Sentencing Commission nevertheless took the identified feature into account in its formulation (and if so, to what end). <i>Dethlefs,</i> 123 F.3d at 44. To solve this conundrum, we must consider whether that feature suffices to remove a case from the heartland established by the guidelines as they apply to the offense of conviction. <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 95, 116 S.Ct. 2035; <i>Dethlefs,</i> 123 F.3d at 44. We perform this task mindful that the Court has predicted that departures premised on such unmentioned circumstances will be rare. <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 95, 116 S.Ct. 2035.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this is an illegal reentry case &#8212; and we limit our holding accordingly<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> &#8212; this question implicates the theory and structure of USSG &#167; 2L1.2. That guideline covers offenses involving persons who unlawfully enter into, or unlawfully remain in, the United States. By definition, then, the <i>only</i> persons sentenced under that guideline will be deportable aliens. This fact is nose-on-the-face plain, and the Sentencing Commission, in constructing the guideline, must have taken into account not only the immigration status of prospective offenders but also the collateral consequences that would flow from that status within the federal prison system. This is powerful evidence that the distinguishing feature upon which the appellant relies is outside the compass of the departure decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law bears out this intuition. Although the appellant's argument is new to us, it is not new to the federal appellate courts as a whole. An unbroken line of cases holds that where, as here, a defendant is sentenced under USSG &#167; 2L1.2 following his conviction for an illegal reentry offense, adverse collateral penal consequences of the type and kind feared by the appellant are not a cognizable basis for a downward departure. <i>See United States v. Martinez-Carillo,</i> 250 F.3d 1101, 1106-07 (7th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 285, 151 L.Ed.2d 210 (2001); <i>United States v. Cardosa-Rodriguez,</i> 241 F.3d 613, 614 (8th Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Garay,</i> 235 F.3d 230, 232-34 (5th Cir.2000), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 121 S.Ct. 1633, 149 L.Ed.2d 494 (2001); <i>United States v. Martinez-Ramos,</i> 184 F.3d 1055, 1057-59 (9th Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Ebolum,</i> 72 F.3d 35, 37-39 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These decisions rest on bedrock. Deportable alien status is a universal concomitant of crimes such as illegal reentry, and, thus, common sense dictates that such status must have been weighed by the Sentencing Commission in formulating USSG &#167; 2L1.2 and setting the attendant offense levels. This means, of course, that far from being a special, unusual, or atypical feature of an illegal reentry case, susceptibility to deportation is a common thread that runs through all such cases. Without more, this circumstance (and, by extension, the collateral consequences that flow from it) is insufficient to take an illegal reentry case out of the heartland associated with USSG &#167; 2L1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If further support for this conclusion is needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; we note that our resolution of this question is foreshadowed by our earlier decision in <i>United States v. Clase-Espinal,</i> 115 F.3d 1054 (1st Cir.1997). There, the defendant argued (and the district court agreed) that his willingness to stipulate to deportability was an appropriate basis on which to depart downward. <i>Id.</i> at 1057. We reversed, concluding that the Sentencing Commission must have known that many of those persons sentenced for criminal offenses in the federal courts are deportable aliens. <i>Id.</i> at 1057-58. Thus, the Commission must have been \"fully cognizant that virtually all alien criminal defendants, convicted under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) and sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2, would be subject to deportation and that many undoubtedly would stipulate to deportation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1059. Based on this reasoning, we held that the defendant's willingness to accede to deportation was not a sufficiently atypical circumstance to justify a downward departure (at least in the absence of a colorable defense to deportation). <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at bar is a fair congener. We think it is equally certain that the Sentencing Commission realized that all persons convicted under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) and sentenced pursuant to USSG &#167; 2L1.2 would be deportable (and, thus, subject to certain disadvantages within the federal prison system). It follows inexorably that the Commission must have taken that factor into account in framing the relevant guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has two rejoinders. First, he notes that both the statute of conviction, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326, and the pivotal guideline, USSG &#167; 2L1.2, refer to aliens who have previously been deported (that is, they speak only in the past tense) and do not refer to an alien's <i>present</i> status. He seizes upon this usage to suggest the obvious: that having been deported in the past is not necessarily the same as being presently deportable. For our purposes, however, this is a distinction without a difference: since the appellant's present status as a deportable alien flows ineluctably from his previous deportation (coupled, of course, with his subsequent unlawful reentry into the United States), the past and present merge. Put another way, the appellant's status as a deportable alien is an inherent element of the crime that he committed and to which both the statute and the guideline apply, and so this element must have been taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in constructing USSG &#167; 2L1.2. <i>See Martinez-Ramos,</i> 184 F.3d at 1058; <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Portillo,</i> 121 F.3d 1122, 1124-25 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the appellant argues that if the sentencing guidelines do not expressly forbid downward departures based on a particular circumstance, the district court must necessarily be authorized to depart on the basis of that circumstance. Building on this shaky foundation, he posits that because the Sentencing Commission eschewed any mention of the adverse collateral penal consequences attendant to deportable status, that circumstance must be a lawful basis for departure. We do not agree with either the appellant's premise or his conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has made it crystal clear that impermissible bases for departure need not be invoked by name in the sentencing guidelines. <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 110, 116 S.Ct. 2035. Forbidden factors may be implicit as well as explicit. <i>United States v. Tappin,</i> 205 F.3d 536, 542 (2d Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 531 U.S. 910, 121 S.Ct. 260, 148 L.Ed.2d 189 (2000). Substantial case law emanating from this court subsequent to <i>Koon</i> validates this point. <i>E.g., United States v. Maldonado,</i> 242 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.2001) (holding that the cost of incarcerating a defendant who will ultimately be deported is categorically excluded from consideration as a lawful basis for a downward departure); <i>Snyder,</i> 136 F.3d at 68 (holding that even though the Sentencing Commission has not proscribed federal-state sentencing disparity as a ground for departure, that circumstance \"is never a valid basis for a downward departure\"); <i>Dethlefs,</i> 123 F.3d at 49 (holding that the fact of a straight guilty plea, without more, is categorically excluded, by implication, as a basis for a downward departure); <i>Clase-Espinal,</i> 115 F.3d at 1060 (holding that willingness to stipulate to deportation is categorically excluded as a ground for departure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the ground for departure advocated by the appellant is insufficient as a matter of law to distinguish his case from the mine-run of illegal reentry offenses subject to the strictures of USSG &#167; 2L1.2. If the law were otherwise, then every defendant in an illegal reentry case automatically would qualify for such a departure, thus emptying the \"heartland\" concept of its essential meaning. We cannot place our imprimatur upon so counterintuitive a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We hold that in the case of defendants sentenced for illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) and USSG &#167; 2L1.2, a district court may not depart downward on the basis that deportable status ostensibly carries with it certain adverse collateral penal consequences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Because the court below correctly anticipated this holding, it acted appropriately in rejecting the appellant's entreaty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> With exceptions not relevant here, the statute of conviction provides that any alien who, after having been deported, \"enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States\" without the Attorney General's express consent to apply for his readmission shall be guilty of a federal crime and punished as provided by law. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a)(2)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> One court has indicated that a downward departure \"may be appropriate where the defendant's status as a deportable alien is likely to cause a fortuitous increase in the severity of his sentence.\"<i>United States v. Smith,</i> 27 F.3d 649, 655 (D.C.Cir.1994). But <i>Smith</i> involved a sentence imposed for a drug-trafficking offense rather than for an illegal reentry offense. For the reasons explicated in the text, illegal reentry cases are functionally different as they pertain to this point. Hence, this case does not require us to take a view as to the continuing vitality of the <i>Smith</i> court's holding (which, in all events, antedated <i>Koon</i>).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We do not reach (and, therefore, express no opinion on) the issue of whether a deportable alien does, in fact, suffer adverse penal consequences simply by virtue of his status.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2035</span></a></span>, we subject the district court's determination that it lacked authority to depart to de novo review and proceed to \"determine the existence <i>vel non</i> of legal error without special deference to the sentencing court's views,\" <i>Snyder,</i> 136 F.3d at 67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the departure request had its genesis in the sentencing guidelines' general departure provision, USSG &#167; 5K2.0. Echoing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b), that provision empowers the sentencing court to deviate from the guideline sentencing range \"if the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\" USSG &#167; 5K2.0 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Even so, not every aggravating or mitigating circumstance has the capability of supporting a departure: to serve that purpose, \"the circumstance must render the case atypical and take it out of the heartland for which the applicable guideline was designed.\" <i>United States v. Dethlefs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197512\"><a href=\"/opinion/197512/united-states-v-dethlefs/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appellant's case hinges on whether the sentencing court correctly concluded that the guidelines did not permit it to honor the appellant's identified ground for departure. We turn, then, to an evaluation of that conclusion. In conducting that evaluation, our inquiry centers on whether the identified ground for departure &#8212; the feature on which the appellant relies to distinguish his case from the mine-run &#8212; \"potentially, take[s] [the case] outside the Guidelines' `heartland,'\" thus \"mak[ing] of it a special, or unusual, case.\" <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because the sentencing guidelines never mention this incident of the incarceration of an alien convicted of an illegal reentry, the question reduces to whether the Sentencing Commission nevertheless took the identified feature into account in its formulation (and if so, to what end). <i>Dethlefs,</i> 123 F.3d at 44. To solve this conundrum, we must consider whether that feature suffices to remove a case from the heartland established by the guidelines as they apply to the offense of conviction. <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2035</span></a></span>; <i>Dethlefs,</i> 123 F.3d at 44. We perform this task mindful that the Court has predicted that departures premised on such unmentioned circumstances will be rare. <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That guideline covers offenses involving persons who unlawfully enter into, or unlawfully remain in, the United States. By definition, then, the <i>only</i> persons sentenced under that guideline will be deportable aliens. This fact is nose-on-the-face plain, and the Sentencing Commission, in constructing the guideline, must have taken into account not only the immigration status of prospective offenders but also the collateral consequences that would flow from that status within the federal prison system. This is powerful evidence that the distinguishing feature upon which the appellant relies is outside the compass of the departure decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law bears out this intuition. Although the appellant's argument is new to us, it is not new to the federal appellate courts as a whole. An unbroken line of cases holds that where, as here, a defendant is sentenced under USSG &#167; 2L1.2 following his conviction for an illegal reentry offense, adverse collateral penal consequences of the type and kind feared by the appellant are not a cognizable basis for a downward departure. <i>See United States v.

Deportable alien status is a universal concomitant of crimes such as illegal reentry, and, thus, common sense dictates that such status must have been weighed by the Sentencing Commission in formulating USSG &#167; 2L1.2 and setting the attendant offense levels. This means, of course, that far from being a special, unusual, or atypical feature of an illegal reentry case, susceptibility to deportation is a common thread that runs through all such cases. Without more, this circumstance (and, by extension, the collateral consequences that flow from it) is insufficient to take an illegal reentry case out of the heartland associated with USSG &#167; 2L1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If further support for this conclusion is needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; we note that our resolution of this question is foreshadowed by our earlier decision in <i>United States v. Clase-Espinal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197424\"><a href=\"/opinion/197424/united-states-v-clase-espinal/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1997). There, the defendant argued (and the district court agreed) that his willingness to stipulate to deportability was an appropriate basis on which to depart downward. <i>Id.</i> at 1057. We reversed, concluding that the Sentencing Commission must have known that many of those persons sentenced for criminal offenses in the federal courts are deportable aliens. <i>Id.</i> at 1057-58. Thus, the Commission must have been \"fully cognizant that virtually all alien criminal defendants, convicted under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) and sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2, would be subject to deportation and that many undoubtedly would stipulate to deportation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1059. Based on this reasoning, we held that the defendant's willingness to accede to deportation was not a sufficiently atypical circumstance to justify a downward departure (at least in the absence of a colorable defense to deportation). <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at bar is a fair congener. We think it is equally certain that the Sentencing Commission realized that all persons convicted under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) and sentenced pursuant to USSG &#167; 2L1.2 would be deportable (and, thus, subject to certain disadvantages within the federal prison system). It follows inexorably that the Commission must have taken that factor into account in framing the relevant guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has two rejoinders. First, he notes that both the statute of conviction, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326, and the pivotal guideline, USSG &#167; 2L1.2, refer to aliens who have previously been deported (that is, they speak only in the past tense) and do not refer to an alien's <i>present</i> status. He seizes upon this usage to suggest the obvious: that having been deported in the past is not necessarily the same as being presently deportable. For our purposes, however, this is a distinction without a difference: since the appellant's present status as a deportable alien flows ineluctably from his previous deportation (coupled, of course, with his subsequent unlawful reentry into the United States), the past and present merge. Put another way, the appellant's status as a deportable alien is an inherent element of the crime that he committed and to which both the statute and the guideline apply, and so this element must have been taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in constructing USSG &#167; 2L1.2. <i>See Martinez-Ramos,</i> 184 F.3d at 1058; <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Portillo,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></span>, 1124-25 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the appellant argues that if the sentencing guidelines do not expressly forbid downward departures based on a particular circumstance, the district court must necessarily be authorized to depart on the basis of that circumstance. Building on this shaky foundation, he posits that because the Sentencing Commission eschewed any mention of the adverse collateral penal consequences attendant to deportable status, that circumstance must be a lawful basis for departure. We do not agree with either the appellant's premise or his conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has made it crystal clear that impermissible bases for departure need not be invoked by name in the sentencing guidelines. <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 110, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2035</span></a></span>. Forbidden factors may be implicit as well as explicit. <i>United States v. Tappin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767877\"><a href=\"/opinion/767877/united-states-v-dennis-llewellyn-tappin/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span>, 542 (2d Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></span> (2000). Substantial case law emanating from this court subsequent to <i>Koon</i> validates this point. <i>E.g., United States v. Maldonado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199284\"><a href=\"/opinion/199284/united-states-v-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.2001) (holding that the cost of incarcerating a defendant who will ultimately be deported is categorically excluded from consideration as a lawful basis for a downward departure); <i>Snyder,</i> 136 F.3d at 68 (holding that even though the Sentencing Commission has not proscribed federal-state sentencing disparity as a ground for departure, that circumstance \"is never a valid basis for a downward departure\"); <i>Dethlefs,</i> 123 F.3d at 49 (holding that the fact of a straight guilty plea, without more, is categorically excluded, by implication, as a basis for a downward departure); <i>Clase-Espinal,</i> 115 F.3d at 1060 (holding that willingness to stipulate to deportation is categorically excluded as a ground for departure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the ground for departure advocated by the appellant is insufficient as a matter of law to distinguish his case from the mine-run of illegal reentry offenses subject to the strictures of USSG &#167; 2L1.2. If the law were otherwise, then every defendant in an illegal reentry case automatically would qualify for such a departure, thus emptying the \"heartland\" concept of its essential meaning. We cannot place our imprimatur upon so counterintuitive a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We hold that in the case of defendants sentenced for illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) and USSG &#167; 2L1.2, a district court may not depart downward on the basis that deportable status ostensibly carries with it certain adverse collateral penal consequences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Because the court below correctly anticipated this holding, it acted appropriately in rejecting the appellant's entreaty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> With exceptions not relevant here, the statute of conviction provides that any alien who, after having been deported, \"enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States\" without the Attorney General's express consent to apply for his readmission shall be guilty of a federal crime and punished as provided by law. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a)(2)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> One court has indicated that a downward departure \"may be appropriate where the defendant's status as a deportable alien is likely to cause a fortuitous increase in the severity of his sentence.\"<i>United States v.

But <i>Smith</i> involved a sentence imposed for a drug-trafficking offense rather than for an illegal reentry offense. For the reasons explicated in the text, illegal reentry cases are functionally different as they pertain to this point. Hence, this case does not require us to take a view as to the continuing vitality of the <i>Smith</i> court's holding (which, in all events, antedated <i>Koon</i>).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We do not reach (and, therefore, express no opinion on) the issue of whether a deportable alien does, in fact, suffer adverse penal consequences simply by virtue of his status.
