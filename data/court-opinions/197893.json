Friedman with whom Kenneth M. Bello, Joseph P. Curtinand Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. were on\r\nbrief for appellants.\r\n    Frank J. Teague with whom Edward T. Patten and Mills, Teague\r\n&amp; Patten were on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                        April 3, 1998\r\n\n BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  Frederick Meltzer brought suit in\r\nstate court, claiming that he had been discharged without cause and\r\nwithout the compensation specified in his employment contract.  The\r\n   case was removed to federal court based on diversity of\r\ncitizenship.  Following a trial, the jury found in favor of Meltzer\r\nand awarded him almost $400,000 in damages.  This appeal by the\r\n             district-court defendants followed.\r\n    The main issue on appeal is whether the defendants were\r\nentitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  In substance,\r\ndefendants claim the jury was obliged to find that Meltzer had\r\nengaged in \"an act of serious misconduct\" which under his contract\r\nwould have justified dismissal without further compensation.  We\r\nset forth the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. \r\nTransamerica Premier Ins. Co. v. Ober, 107 F.3d 925, 929 (1st Cir.\r\n                            1997).\r\n     In 1993, Comerica, Incorporated, formed a wholly owned\r\nsubsidiary, World Asset Management.  The following year the new\r\nsubsidiary hired Meltzer as the managing director of its fixed\r\nincome bond department.  To lure him away from his job with an\r\nestablished Boston firm, World Asset Management gave him a three-\r\nyear contract at a high salary with a guaranteed minimum bonus. \r\nThe contract provided that if terminated without cause, Meltzer\r\nwould receive the balance of compensation specified for the entire\r\ncontract.  \"Cause\" was further defined as including \"an act of\r\n                     serious misconduct.\"\r\n     During 1994, World Asset Management had under lease a\r\nportable computer terminal from Bloomberg LP, a device known in the\r\ntrade simply as a \"Bloomberg,\" providing access to real-time stock\r\nand bond market quotes and other information. Meltzer's company\r\nalso leased software, used in risk management for bond portfolios,\r\nfrom Capital Management Sciences, a competitor of Bloomberg LP. \r\nWorld Asset Management secretly lent the Bloomberg computer to\r\nCapital Management Sciences in exchange for a discount on the cost\r\n               of the risk-management software.\r\n     The persons primarily responsible for the decision to\r\nloan the Bloomberg were Meltzer's superior, Charles Kelso (CEO of\r\nWorld Asset Management) and Meltzer's subordinate, Jonathan Jensen. \r\nMeltzer was present at the meeting in which Jensen proposed the\r\nloan and Kelso approved it.  According to Meltzer, he made no\r\ncomment on the proposal, nor did he attempt to raise the matter\r\n with higher level officials at Comerica.  The meeting was in\r\nSeptember 1994, and the Bloomberg was actually loaned to Capital\r\n            Management Sciences in December 1994.\r\n    In the meantime, Comerica affiliated itself with another\r\n  company, Munder Capital Management, and the two companies\r\nreorganized World Asset Management as a partnership between them. \r\nKelso was replaced as head of World Asset Management by Stephen\r\nAlbrecht.  Meltzer said at trial that he told Albrecht about the\r\nloan of the Bloomberg during December 1994, and Albrecht approved\r\nthe plan.  In any event, Albrecht made further inquiries of Meltzer\r\n in February 1995 and ultimately told Meltzer to retrieve the\r\n                Bloomberg, which Meltzer did.\r\n         In February 1995, Albrecht discharged Meltzer,\r\npurportedly on the ground that his involvement in the loan of the\r\n Bloomberg constituted \"serious misconduct.\"  Meltzer in turn\r\nbrought the present action against Comerica and the Munder firm. \r\nThe defendants accept responsibility for carrying out World Asset\r\nManagement's employment contract with Meltzer but insist that he\r\nwas fired for cause.  In returning a verdict in Meltzer's favor,\r\nthe jury found by special verdict that Meltzer had not engaged in\r\n               \"an act of serious misconduct.\"\r\n   The parties agree that Meltzer's employment contract must\r\nbe construed in accordance with Michigan law.  The defendants point\r\nus to case law in Michigan holding that an employer can establish\r\nits own standards for job performance and can dismiss for cause any\r\nemployee who fails to adhere to those standards, even if the judge\r\n or the jury might think that the standards were unreasonably\r\ndemanding.  See Toussaint v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan,\r\n292 N.W.2d 880, 897 (Mich. 1980).  The gist of defendants' argument\r\non appeal is that the loan of the Bloomberg was manifestly improper\r\nand that Meltzer's \"participation\" or \"involvement\" necessarily\r\n   constituted \"serious misconduct\" providing cause for his\r\n                         termination.\r\n     Defendants argue at length that the loan violated the\r\nterms of the Bloomberg contract, the general provisions of the\r\n  Comerica's code of ethics requiring employees to safeguard\r\n    confidential information, and other civil and criminal\r\nrestrictions.  It is sufficient for us that the extent of Meltzer's\r\ninvolvement or participation in the loan was disputed and that on\r\n  one reading of the evidence he was no more than minimally\r\nconnected.  The jury was thus free to conclude that even if the\r\nloan were serious misconduct, Meltzer's connection to it was not\r\n              \"serious misconduct\" on his part.\r\n      Defendants next assert that they were entitled to an\r\ninstruction that, although Meltzer asserted that Kelso had approved\r\nthe loan, \"[i]t is not a defense that a supervisor authorized\r\nunlawful, unethical or unreasonable acts to be performed.\"  The\r\ndefendants' proposed instruction contained other language that the\r\ndistrict court did adopt, including the tamer statement that \"[a]n\r\nemployer [sic] only has a duty to follow a supervisor's orders if\r\nthose orders are lawful,\" and \"[a]n employee cannot be discharged\r\n for refusing to perform an unlawful act.\"  But obviously the\r\nadditional language requested by the defendants would have been\r\n                  even more helpful to them.\r\n   The difficulty is that the key sentence that the district\r\njudge refused to charge seems to us to be misleading in the context\r\nof these facts.  While there is certainly some behavior that a\r\nsupervisor cannot \"authorize,\" in the present case Kelso's alleged\r\n  approval had at least some bearing on the question whether\r\nMeltzer's failure to report or interfere with the transaction was\r\n\"serious misconduct.\"  Being unbalanced, the instruction as framed\r\nby the defendants did not have to be given.  See Harrington v.\r\n     United States, 504 F.2d 1306, 1317 (1st Cir. 1974).\r\n       The defendants further object that Meltzer's post-\r\n   termination earnings should have been offset against his\r\ncompensation due under the contract.  Well before the scheduled\r\ntrial, defendants stipulated that if Meltzer was not discharged for\r\nserious misconduct, then his damages were the specific amount\r\ncalculated under his contract for the remainder of the three-year\r\nterm, specifically, $398,773.97.  Ten days prior to trial the\r\ndefendants moved to set aside that stipulation, and, several days\r\nlater, they moved to amend their answer to assert an affirmative\r\n                defense of actual mitigation.\r\n     We see no error in the district court's decision that\r\ndefendants' last-minute attempted change of position should not be\r\nallowed because of the extreme delay and the prejudice to Meltzer. \r\nSee Grant v. News Group Boston, Inc., 55 F.3d 1, 5 (1995) (denial\r\nof leave to amend reviewed for abuse of discretion).  This makes it\r\nunnecessary to consider the district court's alternative ruling\r\nthat, under the language of the contract, Meltzer was entitled (if\r\ndischarged for cause) to the balance of the prescribed compensation\r\n  with no reduction on account of post-termination earnings\r\n                          elsewhere.\r\n    Finally, defendants' brief challenges several rulings by\r\nthe district judge on the admissibility of evidence during trial. \r\nWe have examined her rulings and concluded that they are either\r\ncorrect or, if not, that they did not constitute prejudicial error. \r\nWithout going into detail, it is plain that the result of the case\r\n would have been no different if each of the three challenged\r\n rulings had been resolved by the trial judge in favor of the\r\n                         defendants.\r\n                            Affirmed.\n",
