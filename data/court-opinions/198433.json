Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Santiago Mari Roca on brief for appellants.\r\n   Osvaldo H. Puig-Hernandez and Smith &amp; Nevares on brief for\r\ndefendant, appellee Jos A. Fuentes-Agostini.\r\n\nApril 16, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  In December 1994, the plaintiffs,\r\nall residents of Lajas, Puerto Rico, filed this civil action in the \r\ndistrict court asserting claims under 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Two of the\r\nplaintiffs are sisters and the gist of the complaint was that they\r\nhad been wrongfully arrested at the apartment of one of the two;\r\nthe co-plaintiffs were the husband of one of the sisters and the\r\nchildren of the other.  The defendants were all individual police\r\nofficers who participated in the arrests or were allegedly\r\nresponsible for supervision of the officers directly involved.\r\nAlthough Puerto Rico itself was not named as a defendant,\r\nits Secretary of Justice provided legal counsel for the defendants,\r\nas permitted by Puerto Rico law.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, \r\n3085-87.  Following a trial in 1996, the jury found six of the\r\nseven defendants liable for violating the civil rights of the\r\nplaintiffs,  and awarded compensatory damages to each plaintiff\r\n(the range was $1,000 to $14,000).  The jury also awarded punitive\r\ndamages to each plaintiff ($1,000 to one and $2,000 to the other\r\nfour), finding that the defendants' conduct was shocking and\r\noffensive to the conscience.\r\nThe judgment awarding $43,000 was entered in August 1996. \r\nIn January 1997, the district judge added $27,000 in attorney's\r\nfees.  In March 1997, the Secretary of Justice notified the six\r\ndefendants held liable by the jury that they would not be\r\nindemnified by Puerto Rico for the judgment against them.   Puerto\r\nRico law permits the Secretary to indemnify for judgments but\r\nspecifically excludes cases \"when inexcusable neglect intervenes.\" \r\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32,  3088(c). The Secretary said that the\r\njury's determination showed lack of good faith and inexcusable\r\nnegligence on the part of the defendants.\r\nAn administrative proceeding then ensued, apparently\r\nbrought by the defendants to contest this ruling.  After a hearing,\r\nthe Secretary again concluded that the defendants were not entitled\r\nto indemnification under the statute and applicable regulations. \r\nAlthough it appears that the Secretary's ruling is subject to\r\nreview in the local courts, there is no indication as to whether\r\nthe defendants sought review.  What is clear is that they did not\r\npay the judgment in the present case.\r\nAlthough Puerto Rico was not a party to the section 1983\r\naction, the plaintiffs nevertheless filed a motion in this case in\r\nFebruary 1998, requesting the district court to order the Secretary\r\nof Justice to satisfy the judgment against the individual\r\ndefendants.  The plaintiffs' theory was that the Secretary was\r\nobliged to indemnify the defendants and that plaintiffs were\r\nentitled to the benefit of these payments.  As authority for the\r\ndistrict court to address the issue, plaintiffs relied upon the All\r\nWrits Act, 28 U.S.C.  1651.\r\n  The Secretary objected to the motion, asserting that\r\nthe Eleventh Amendment barred an award of damages against Puerto\r\nRico when it had not consented to be sued.  In an opinion and order\r\nentered in June 1998, the district court denied the plaintiffs'\r\nmotion and dismissed the supplementary proceeding against the\r\nSecretary.  The court ruled that the motion was in effect one\r\nseeking the payment of funds by the Commonwealth, that the Eleventh\r\nAmendment barred such an action in federal court absent waiver, and\r\nthat none of the events relied on by the plaintiffs constituted\r\nsuch a waiver.\r\nThe plaintiffs now appeal and we affirm.  Nothing\r\nplaintiffs have said counters the district court's conclusion that\r\nthe motion in substance seeks a money judgment against the\r\nCommonwealth.  This circuit has already decided that the\r\nCommonwealth is protected by the Eleventh Amendment to the same\r\nextent as any state, and the panel is governed by that ruling.  SeeMetcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth., 991\r\nF.2d 935, 939 n.3 (1st Cir. 1993).  Thus, the only question worth\r\ndiscussing is whether there has been a waiver of Eleventh Amendment\r\nimmunity.\r\nThe indemnification provisions of Puerto Rico law\r\ncertainly do not comprise such a waiver.  Puerto Rico law permits \r\nan official, charged in a civil rights action relating to official\r\nduties, to \"request\" legal representation by the Commonwealth and\r\nit permits the Commonwealth \"subsequently\" to assume payment of any\r\njudgment.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32,  3085.  It also provides that\r\nthe Secretary shall decide in which cases the Commonwealth shall\r\nassume representation and \"subsequently, after considering the\r\nfindings of the court or which arise from the evidence presented,\"\r\nwhether it is \"in order\" to pay the judgment.  Id.  3087.\r\nOnly limited standards are provided for granting or\r\nrefusing indemnification, but they go to the merits of the\r\nSecretary's decision, which we do not reach.  However, the\r\nEleventh Amendment issue is addressed directly by the section, P.R.\r\nLaws Ann. tit. 32,  3085, which permits the request for\r\nindemnification in civil rights actions; it says that its\r\nprovisions \"shall not be construed . . .as a waiver of the\r\nsovereign immunity of the Commonwealth.\"  Id.  The only remedy\r\nprovided for reviewing the refusal of the Secretary to order\r\nindemnification is by \"petition for review\" before \"the Superior\r\nCourt\" limited solely to questions of law.  Id.  3087.\r\n   There is thus no express waiver of the Eleventh Amendment\r\nban against suit in federal court.  See In re Secretary of Dep't of\r\nCrime Control, 7 F.3d 1140, 1144-48 (4th Cir. 1993) (similar\r\nstatute).  As for implied waiver, it arises only \"by such\r\noverwhelming implication . . . as [will] leave no room for any\r\nother reasonable construction.\"  Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon,\r\n473 U.S. 234, 239-40 (1985) (quoting Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S.\r\n651, 673 (1974)) (brackets in original).  Consent to suit or review\r\nin the Commonwealth's own courts is not enough.  See Great N. Life\r\nIns. Co. v. Read, 322 U.S. 47, 54 (1944).  Indeed, even a state's\r\n\"general waiver\" of sovereign immunity does not remove the bar of\r\nthe Eleventh Amendment.  Atascadero, 473 U.S. at 241. In such\r\ncases, a claim may exist but it would not be enforceable in federal\r\ncourt.\r\n   In this case, the acts said to constitute an implied\r\nwaiver fall pitifully short.  Plaintiffs say that the Secretary\r\nprovided counsel for the defendants in the jury trial, but the\r\nCommonwealth entered no appearance of its own and providing legal\r\naid to another is not a consent to be sued.  Similarly, it does\r\nnot matter whether the Secretary erred in refusing to indemnify the\r\ndefendants; even if the Secretary agreed to indemnify them, the\r\nEleventh Amendment would still bar a claim by the plaintiffs\r\nagainst the Commonwealth in federal court.\r\n   The plaintiffs urge that the Secretary was required to\r\ndecide within 30 days of the jury verdict whether to indemnify the\r\ndefendants, see Regulation 4071, Articulo X(c) (September 8, 1989),\r\nand failed to act within that period.  It is not clear that under\r\nPuerto Rico law this error, if it occurred, creates an obligation\r\nto indemnify that would not otherwise exist.  But in any case the\r\nremedy would be a review action by the defendants in the Superior\r\nCourt.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32,  3087.  Nothing in the alleged\r\ndelay implies, let alone clearly states, that Puerto Rico consents\r\nto be sued in federal court.\r\n   In their brief in this court, the plaintiffs have re-\r\nframed their objection to the delay as if the delay were an\r\nindependent violation of the Constitution.  The argument was\r\nseemingly not made in the district court and is therefore waived. \r\nSee Equine Technologies, Inc. v. Equitechnology, Inc., 68 F.3d 542,\r\n546 (1st Cir. 1995).  In any case, there is nothing to support the\r\nclaim that the delay violated the Constitution, see Coniston Corp.v. Village of Hoffman Estates, 844 F.2d 461, 467 (7th Cir. 1988) (a\r\nviolation of state law is not, without more, a denial of due\r\nprocess of law), and, if any claim existed, it would belong to the\r\ndefendants and not to the plaintiffs.  \r\n   Affirmed.\n",

As authority for the district court to address the issue, plaintiffs relied upon the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary objected to the motion, asserting that the Eleventh Amendment barred an award of damages against Puerto Rico when it had not consented to be sued.  In an opinion and order entered in June 1998, the district court denied the plaintiffs' motion and dismissed the supplementary proceeding against the Secretary.  The court ruled that the motion was in effect one seeking the payment of funds by the Commonwealth, that the Eleventh Amendment barred such an action in federal court absent waiver, and that none of the events relied on by the plaintiffs constituted such a waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs now appeal and we affirm.  Nothing plaintiffs have said counters the district court's conclusion that the motion in substance seeks a money judgment against the Commonwealth.  This circuit has already decided that the Commonwealth is protected by the Eleventh Amendment to the same extent as any state, and the panel is governed by that ruling.  See Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605529\"><a href=\"/opinion/605529/metcalf-eddy-inc-v-puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span>, 939 n. 3 (1st Cir.1993).  Thus, the only question worth discussing is whether there has been a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indemnification provisions of Puerto Rico law certainly do not comprise such a waiver.  Puerto Rico law permits an official, charged in a civil rights action relating to official duties, to \"request\" legal representation by the Commonwealth and it permits the Commonwealth \"subsequently\" to assume payment of any judgment.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, &#167; 3085.  It also provides that the Secretary shall decide in which cases the Commonwealth shall assume representation and \"subsequently, after considering the findings of the court or which arise from the evidence presented,\" whether it is \"in order\" to pay the judgment.  Id. &#167; 3087.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only limited standards are provided for granting or refusing indemnification, but they go to the merits of the Secretary's decision, which we do not reach.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  However, the Eleventh Amendment issue is addressed directly by the section, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, &#167; 3085, which permits the request for indemnification in civil rights actions;  it says that its provisions \"shall not be construed ... as a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the Commonwealth.\"  Id. The only remedy provided for reviewing the refusal of the Secretary to order indemnification is by \"petition for review\" before \"the Superior Court\" limited solely to questions of law.  Id. &#167; 3087.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is thus no express waiver of the Eleventh Amendment ban against suit in federal court.  See In re Secretary of Dep't of Crime Control, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"655513\"><a href=\"/opinion/655513/in-re-secretary-of-the-department-of-crime-control-and-public-safety-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span>, 1144-48 (4th Cir.1993) (similar statute).  As for implied waiver, it arises only \"by such overwhelming implication ... as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.\"  Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111503\"><a href=\"/opinion/111503/atascadero-state-hospital-v-scanlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span>, 239-40, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111503\"><a href=\"/opinion/111503/atascadero-state-hospital-v-scanlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Co. v. Read, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103973\"><a href=\"/opinion/103973/great-northern-life-ins-co-v-read/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103973\"><a href=\"/opinion/103973/great-northern-life-ins-co-v-read/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></a></span> (1944).  Indeed, even a state's \"general waiver\" of sovereign immunity does not remove the bar of the Eleventh Amendment.  Atascadero, 473 U.S. at 241.   In such cases, a claim may exist but it would not be enforceable in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the acts said to constitute an implied waiver fall pitifully short.  Plaintiffs say that the Secretary provided counsel for the defendants in the jury trial, but the Commonwealth entered no appearance of its own and providing legal aid to another is not a consent to be sued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Similarly, it does not matter whether the Secretary erred in refusing to indemnify the defendants;  even if the Secretary agreed to indemnify them, the Eleventh Amendment would still bar a claim by the plaintiffs against the Commonwealth in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs urge that the Secretary was required to decide within 30 days of the jury verdict whether to indemnify the defendants, see Regulation 4071, Articulo X(c) (September 8, 1989), and failed to act within that period.  It is not clear that under Puerto Rico law this error, if it occurred, creates an obligation to indemnify that would not otherwise exist.  But in any case the remedy would be a review action by the defendants in the Superior Court.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, &#167; 3087.  Nothing in the alleged delay implies, let alone clearly states, that Puerto Rico consents to be sued in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their brief in this court, the plaintiffs have re-framed their objection to the delay as if the delay were an independent violation of the Constitution.  The argument was seemingly not made in the district court and is therefore waived.  See Equine Technologies, Inc. v. Equitechnology, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196378\"><a href=\"/opinion/196378/equine-v-equitechnology/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 546 (1st Cir.1995).  In any case, there is nothing to support the claim that the delay violated the Constitution, see Coniston Corp. v. Village of Hoffman Estates, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504444\"><a href=\"/opinion/504444/coniston-corporation-v-village-of-hoffman-estates/\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 467 (7th Cir.1988) (a violation of state law is not, without more, a denial of due process of law), and, if any claim existed, it would belong to the defendants and not to the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The statute purports to require indemnification only where the judgment arises out of conduct that the Secretary approved in advance.  Indemnification is forbidden in certain other cases, including \"inexcusable negligence.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, &#167; 3088</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs cite as contrary precedent a case from the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals, Garcia v. E.L.A., 96 T.C.A. 3:19 (September 11, 1995).  Although its language might be read out of context to support their position, the case is concerned not with waiver of an Eleventh Amendment objection but with a quite different issue, namely, whether under Puerto Rico law the dollar limits on waivers of sovereign immunity for judgments against state employees in their official capacity limit judgments against state employees in their private capacity when the state has agreed to indemnify the employees</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
