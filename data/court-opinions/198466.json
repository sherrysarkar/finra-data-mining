Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n                     Before\r\n\n             Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n         Magill, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n           and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\nLenore Glaser, by appointment of the Court, with whom Stern,\r\nShapiro, Weissberg &amp; Garin, was on brief, for appellant.\r\nPatrick M. Hamilton, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n                  May 17, 1999\r\n                                           MAGILL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Manuel Morillo pleaded\r\nguilty in federal court to eight counts of a ten count indictment\r\ncharging him with various drug trafficking offenses.  During\r\nsentencing, the district court counted a state court sentence,\r\nlabeled a \"continuance without a finding\" (CWOF), as a prior\r\nsentence when calculating Morillo's criminal history category.  As\r\na result, Morillo was given a criminal history category of III\r\nwhich, in turn, rendered him ineligible for the Guidelines' so-\r\ncalled \"safety valve\" provision, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\r\n5C1.2.  Morillo appeals the district court's decision to count\r\nthe CWOF as a prior sentence.  We affirm.\r\n                       I.\r\nOn January 29, 1997, a complaint issued in Massachusetts\r\nstate court against Morillo for violating a domestic violence\r\nrestraining order and threatening to commit a crime.  Rather than\r\nproceed to trial on the state charges, Morillo filed a \"TENDER OF\r\nPLEA OR ADMISSION WAIVER OF RIGHTS\" form with the court.  In that\r\nform, Morillo tendered an \"admission to facts sufficient for a\r\nfinding of guilty\" conditioned upon the court's willingness to\r\ncontinue the case without a finding instead of entering a guilty\r\nfinding.  Prior to granting the CWOF, the state court required\r\nMorillo to execute a written waiver of his constitutional rights to\r\na jury trial, to confront, cross-examine, and compel witnesses, to\r\nremain silent, and to present evidence in his own behalf.  That \r\ncourt also conducted an oral colloquy, satisfying itself that\r\nMorillo had voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his\r\nconstitutional rights, and that a factual basis existed for\r\nMorillo's admission.  The court then imposed the CWOF, conditioned\r\nupon Morillo's successful completion of one year of unsupervised\r\nprobation.\r\nIn November 1997, during his state probationary period,\r\nMorillo was charged in federal court on a ten count indictment with\r\ndistribution of cocaine and distribution and conspiracy to\r\ndistribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841 and 846. \r\nMorillo pleaded guilty to eight of the ten counts.\r\nIn calculating Morillo's sentence, the district court\r\nadded four points to Morillo's criminal history which resulted in\r\na criminal history category of III.  Three of the four points\r\nstemmed from the Massachusetts CWOF.  The court assigned one point\r\npursuant to U.S.S.G.  4A1.1(c) and 4A1.2, finding that Morillo's\r\n\"admission of sufficient facts\" and resulting CWOF constituted a\r\nprior sentence.  The court added two more points because Morillo\r\nwas arrested for a federal offense while on probation for the state\r\ncharge.  See U.S.S.G.  4A1.1(d).  With an offense level of twenty-\r\nfive and a criminal history category of III, the district court\r\nsentenced Morillo to sixty-six months' imprisonment.  Had the\r\ndistrict court not counted Morillo's CWOF, he would have been\r\neligible for the so-called \"safety valve\" provision of U.S.S.G.  5C1.2.\r\n                      II.\r\nWe review de novo a district court's application of the\r\nSentencing Guidelines.  See United States v. Nicholas, 133 F.3d\r\n133, 134 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nThe Sentencing Guidelines require a court to count\r\ncertain prior sentences when calculating a defendant's criminal\r\nhistory category.  See U.S.S.G.  4A1.1, 4A1.2.  Generally\r\nspeaking, diversionary dispositions, e.g., deferred prosecutions,\r\nare not counted for criminal history purposes.  See U.S.S.G.\r\n4A1.2(f).  However, \"[a] diversionary disposition resulting from\r\na finding or admission of guilt, or a plea of nolo contendere, in\r\na judicial proceeding is counted as a sentence under  4A1.1(c)\r\neven if a conviction is not formally entered.\"  Id.  (first\r\nemphasis added).  This rule \"reflects a policy that defendants who\r\nreceive the benefit of a rehabilitative sentence and continue to\r\ncommit crimes should not be treated with further leniency.\" \r\nU.S.S.G.  4A1.2 comment. (n.9).\r\nThe question on appeal is whether Morillo's CWOF should\r\nbe considered a \"diversionary disposition resulting from a[n] . . .\r\nadmission of guilt.\"  U.S.S.G.  4A1.2(f).  Morillo argues it\r\nshould not for two reasons:  first, he was not made aware that this\r\nadmission would be treated as a guilty plea; and second, the court\r\nentered the CWOF despite the absence of a written stipulation of\r\nfacts.  We disagree.\r\nWe begin with the applicable Massachusetts law.  Under\r\ncurrent Massachusetts law, a defendant, instead of pleading guilty,\r\nmay \"admit to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty.\" \r\nSee Mass. R. Crim. P. 12(a)(3).  The defendant may then request a\r\nspecific disposition, including that a guilty finding not be\r\nentered and that the court continue the case without a finding of\r\nguilt.  See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 278,  18 (West 1998).  Once\r\nthis admission is tendered, the court must inform the defendant\r\nthat if the court does not accept the proposed disposition, the\r\ndefendant has the right to withdraw the admission.  See id.  If the\r\ncourt grants the CWOF, the case will be continued until a later\r\ndate when it will be dismissed, provided that the defendant\r\ncomplies with specified conditions set by the court.  See id.\r\nOnce the court agrees to a CWOF, it is required to treat\r\nthe admission of sufficient facts as a guilty plea.  See id. (\"If\r\na defendant . . . attempts to enter a plea or statement consisting\r\nof an admission of facts sufficient for a finding of guilt, or some\r\nsimilar statement, such admission shall be deemed a tender of a\r\nplea of guilty for purposes of the procedures set forth in this\r\nsection.\").  Thus, the court must comply with Massachusetts's\r\nguilty plea procedures before accepting such an admission and\r\nimposing a CWOF.  See Mass. R. Crim. P. 12.  Among the procedures\r\nmandated under Rule 12, a judge must conduct a hearing and satisfy\r\nhimself that there is a factual basis for the charge.  See Mass.\r\nR. Crim. P. 12(c)(5)(A).  Rule 12 does not require a written\r\nstipulation of facts.\r\nIn this case, the state court carefully followed the\r\nprocedures set out in Rule 12 when it accepted Morillo's admission. \r\nMorillo, his attorney, the prosecutor and the judge all signed a\r\n\"TENDER OF PLEA OR ADMISSION WAIVER OF RIGHTS\" form.  See\r\nAppellee's Add. at 8-9.  On this form, Morillo acknowledged that he\r\nwas \"tender[ing] . . . [an] ADMISSION TO FACTS SUFFICIENT FOR A\r\nFINDING OF GUILTY\" conditioned upon receiving a continuance without\r\na finding.  Id.  I.  He then signed a \"waiver of rights,\"\r\nindicating he was waiving his right to a trial as well as other\r\ntrial rights, that he had discussed his rights with his attorney,\r\nthat he understood the nature of the charge, and that his admission\r\nwas voluntary.  Id.  IV.  Morillo's counsel certified that he had\r\nexplained the \"provisions of law regarding the defendant's waiver\r\nof jury trial and other rights so as to enable the defendant to\r\ntender his . . . admission knowingly, intelligently and\r\nvoluntarily.\"  Id.  V.  Finally, the judge certified that he (1)\r\n\"addressed the defendant directly in open court;\" (2) found through\r\noral colloquy that Morillo understood his rights and \"knowingly,\r\nintelligently and voluntarily waived\" those rights; (3) \"found a\r\nfactual basis for the charge(s) to which the defendant is . . .\r\nadmitting;\" and (4) \"found that the facts as related by the\r\nprosecution and admitted by the defendant would support a\r\nconviction on the charges to which the . . . admission is made.\" \r\nId.  VI (emphasis added).  Thus, the state court fully complied\r\nwith both Rule 12 and ch. 278,  18 in accepting Morillo's\r\nadmission.\r\nWe conclude that Morillo's CWOF, entered in accordance\r\nwith the above procedures, was properly counted as a \"diversionary\r\ndisposition resulting from a[n] . . . admission of guilt . . . in\r\na judicial proceeding.\"  U.S.S.G.  4A1.2(f).  As the language of\r\nthe Guidelines makes clear, only an admission of guilt is required\r\na finding of guilt is not.  Moreover, under Massachusetts law,\r\nMorillo's \"[a]dmission to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of\r\nguilty is treated as a plea of guilty.\"  See Luk v. Commonwealth,\r\n658 N.E.2d 664, 667 n.6 (Mass. 1995) (citing Commonwealth v.\r\nDuquette, 438 N.E.2d 334 (1982)); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278,  18. \r\nThus, given this law and the extensive procedures the court\r\nfollowed, Morillo cannot now claim that he was unaware that his\r\nadmission would be treated as a guilty plea and that it could be\r\nused against him in future proceedings.  See United States v.\r\nRoberts, 39 F.3d 10, 12 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"A defendant who commits\r\na new crime after creating a prior criminal record has fair warning\r\nthat the record may haunt him or her in sentencing, absent quite\r\nextraordinary circumstances.\").\r\nNotwithstanding the court's compliance with Rule 12 and\r\nCh. 278,  18, Morillo argues that the district court was required\r\nto provide a written stipulation of facts when accepting his\r\nadmission.  He cites for this proposition Commonwealth v. Duquette,\r\n438 N.E.2d 334 (Mass. 1982), a case decided under Massachusetts's\r\nformer, two-tier system, which was abolished in 1994.  In \r\nDuquette, the Massachusetts Supreme Court suggested various\r\nprocedures to be followed when accepting a defendant's admission to\r\nsufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty.  See 438 N.E.2d at\r\n341-42.  One of these procedures was formalizing the admitted facts\r\nin a written stipulation.  See id. at 342.  We conclude that\r\nDuquette does not require a written stipulation in the instant\r\ncase.\r\nDuquette was decided under an archaic, two-tier system,\r\neach stage of which presented unique concerns with regard to\r\nensuring that the defendant understood the implications of his\r\nadmission to sufficient facts.  The driving concern behind the\r\nDuquette court's prescriptions was that \"the defendant know what\r\nrights he is waiving when he admits to sufficient facts.\"  Id.  The\r\nprocedures outlined, which substantially mimic the requirements of\r\nRule 12, were a suggested means of ensuring that a defendant\r\nunderstood his rights and the consequences of his admission.\r\nThe new statute abandons the old system and clearly\r\nprovides that admissions tendered under ch. 278,  18 are to be\r\ntreated as guilty pleas.  As such, they must comply with the\r\nprocedures set out in Rule 12(c).  It is undisputed that Morillo's\r\nadmission complied with these procedures:  Morillo knew what rights\r\nhe was waiving; the court conducted a colloquy to ensure the\r\nvoluntariness of his waiver and admission; and the judge certified\r\nthat the facts \"admitted by the defendant\" supported the admission. \r\nThus, the court satisfied both Rule 12 and the concerns outlined in\r\nDuquette.  We do not interpret Duquette as requiring anything more\r\nin this circumstance, involving a new law under which the\r\nimplications of the admission and the procedures to be followed are\r\nunambiguous.\r\n\n                      III.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the\r\ndistrict court. \n",

He cites for this proposition Commonwealth v. Duquette,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102848\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102848/commonwealth-v-duquette/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. 1982), a case decided under Massachusetts's\r\nformer, two-tier system, which was abolished in 1994.  In \r\nDuquette, the Massachusetts Supreme Court suggested various\r\nprocedures to be followed when accepting a defendant's admission to\r\nsufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty.  See 438 N.E.2d at\r\n341-42.  One of these procedures was formalizing the admitted facts\r\nin a written stipulation.  See id. at 342.  We conclude that\r\nDuquette does not require a written stipulation in the instant\r\ncase.\r\nDuquette was decided under an archaic, two-tier system,\r\neach stage of which presented unique concerns with regard to\r\nensuring that the defendant understood the implications of his\r\nadmission to sufficient facts.  The driving concern behind the\r\nDuquette court's prescriptions was that \"the defendant know what\r\nrights he is waiving when he admits to sufficient facts.\"  Id.  The\r\nprocedures outlined, which substantially mimic the requirements of\r\nRule 12, were a suggested means of ensuring that a defendant\r\nunderstood his rights and the consequences of his admission.\r\nThe new statute abandons the old system and clearly\r\nprovides that admissions tendered under ch. 278,  18 are to be\r\ntreated as guilty pleas.  As such, they must comply with the\r\nprocedures set out in Rule 12(c).  It is undisputed that Morillo's\r\nadmission complied with these procedures:  Morillo knew what rights\r\nhe was waiving; the court conducted a colloquy to ensure the\r\nvoluntariness of his waiver and admission; and the judge certified\r\nthat the facts \"admitted by the defendant\" supported the admission. \r\nThus, the court satisfied both Rule 12 and the concerns outlined in\r\nDuquette.  We do not interpret Duquette as requiring anything more\r\nin this circumstance, involving a new law under which the\r\nimplications of the admission and the procedures to be followed are\r\nunambiguous.\r\n\n                      III.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the\r\ndistrict court. \n</pre>",
