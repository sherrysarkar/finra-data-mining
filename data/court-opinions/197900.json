Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                      Before\r\n\n               Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n      Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nAstrid Coln-Lede for appellants.\r\nCarlos A. Ortiz-Morales, with whom Alfonso Miranda Cardenas and\r\nMiranda Cardenas &amp; Cordova were on brief for appellee Garcia Rinaldi.\r\nJose Luis Gonzalez-Castaner, with whom Law Offices of Jose Luis\r\nGonzalez-Castaner and Jose R. Ortiz-Velez were on brief for appellees\r\nBetancourt Aquino and Simed.\r\nRafael Mayoral Morales, with whom Latimer, Biaggi, Rachid &amp;\r\nGodreau was on brief for appellee Hosital Pavia.\r\n\n                  April 3, 1998\r\n\n                                             Per Curiam.    Plaintiffs challenge various rulings\r\nunderlying the dismissal of their wrongful death action against Dr.\r\nRaul Garcia Rinaldi, Dr. Benjamin Betancourt Aquino, and Hospital\r\nPavia, for providing negligent post-operative care and supervision\r\nto their father.  We summarily affirm the district court judgment\r\nbased on a thorough review of the entire record.\r\nOn May 11, 1993, plaintiffs' father was admitted to\r\nHospital Pavia and treated by defendant Betancourt for chest pain. \r\nThe next day defendant Garcia performed emergency coronary by-pass\r\nsurgery, followed by a second surgery to correct temporary\r\nbleeding.  During the post-operative recovery period the patient\r\nwas successfully treated for several episodes of cardiac\r\narrhythmia, the latest having occurred three days prior to his\r\ndischarge in stable condition.  On May 23, three days after\r\ndischarge, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died despite defendant\r\nBetancourt's efforts to resuscitate.\r\nThe district court correctly granted summary judgment to\r\nDr. Garcia on the ground that plaintiffs failed to present any\r\nevidence which, if believed, could have rebutted the presumption\r\nunder Puerto Rico law that the decedent received reasonable medical\r\ncare from Dr. Garcia.  See Fernandez v. Corporacion Insular de\r\nSeguros, 79 F.3d 207, 211 (1st Cir. 1996).  Instead, plaintiffs\r\nrelied exclusively upon the unsupported, conclusory allegations in\r\ntheir complaint.  Absent affidavits generating a trialworthy issue,\r\nsummary judgment was inevitable.  See Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds\r\nTobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990); see also Fed. R. Civ.\r\nP. 56(e).\r\nPlaintiffs further contend that they should have been\r\ngranted a new trial because the district court refused to allow\r\ntheir expert witnesses, an internist and a pathologist, to testify\r\nthat defendants Betancourt and Hospital Pavia provided negligent\r\npost-operative care.  The district court committed no error, let\r\nalone manifest error.  See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\r\n1161, 1183 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nFirst, one of the witnesses, neither a surgeon nor a\r\ncardiologist, acknowledged having nothing \"to do with open-heart\r\nsurgery.  It's not my expertise.  I have not been trained for it .\r\n. . .\"  The other, likewise not a cardiologist, had never treated\r\neither a cardiac patient or a post-operative condition; nor did he\r\nexamine the decedent, either before or after death.  Nor was an\r\nautopsy ever performed on the decedent.  \r\nAFFIRMED.\n",
