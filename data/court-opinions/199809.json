The appellant, a labor\n\norganization, challenges the district court's entry of summary judgment\n\nin favor of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on a\n\nclaim of religious discrimination. Because we conclude that the record\n\nevidence reveals a disputed issue of fact with respect to an element of\n\nthe EEOC's prima facie case, we reverse.\n\n                           I.   BACKGROUND\n\n          In accordance with ordinary summary judgment protocol, we\n\nrecite only the undisputed facts, unless otherwise noted.\n\nA.   Events leading to the claim of discrimination\n\n          David Cruz-Carrillo (\"Cruz\") is a member of the Seventh-Day\n\nAdventist Church who claims that the tenets of his religion prohibit\n\nhim from joining a labor organization. Cruz was hired by the Autoridad\n\nde Acueductos y Alcantarillados of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\n(\"AAA\") as a temporary employee in 1986.        When he applied for\n\nemployment with AAA, he never disclosed that his religious beliefs\n\nforbid him from becoming a member of a labor organization. However,\n\nhis application for employment at AAA reveals that Cruz attended\n\nSeventh-Day Adventist schools and graduated from a Seventh-Day\n\nAdventist college.\n\n          Defendant Unión Independiente de la Autoridad de Acueductos\n\ny Alcantarillados (\"UIA\" or \"Union\") is a labor organization created in\n\naccordance with the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Act, 29 L.P.R.A. §§ 61-\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f76.   UIA represents several categories of employees, including\n\noperations and maintenance workers of AAA.1 UIA maintained a Collective\n\nBargaining Agreement (CBA) with AAA that contains a union security\n\nclause, pursuant to which all permanent employees of the appropriate\n\nbargaining unit must belong to the Union.\n\n          On December 5, 1988, Cruz became a permanent employee of AAA.\n\nHe was given written notification of the conditions under which he\n\nwould be employed, including his obligation to join UIA and pay union\n\ndues. According to UIA, Cruz did not state his objection to union\n\nmembership outright at that time.      Instead, he objected only to\n\nspecific union practices, each of which UIA contends it was willing to\n\naccommodate. For example, Cruz objected at various points to attending\n\nSaturday union meetings, joining union demonstrations or strikes,\n\ntaking the Union's loyalty oath, and paying union dues. Through a\n\nseries of correspondence, meetings, and administrative procedures, UIA\n\nexpressed its willingness to exempt Cruz from Saturday meetings and\n\npublic strikes or picketing, to paraphrase its loyalty oath to an\n\naffirmation, and to transfer his dues to a nonprofit organization (but\n\nretain the share used to pay his fringe benefits). Only after Cruz\n\nrejected these proposals, contends UIA, did he assert his objection to\n\nunion membership in any form. Cruz disputes this version of events and\n\n1 Since the UIA represents government employees, its dealings with AAA\nare not governed by the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 151-\n169.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fmaintains that his opposition to union membership was steadfast and\n\nunqualified.\n\n          On March 27, 1991, the Board of Directors of UIA initiated\n\ndisciplinary proceedings against Cruz for his refusal to become a UIA\n\nmember.   At the end of these proceedings, UIA requested that AAA\n\nsuspend Cruz from employment in accordance with the union security\n\nclause.   Cruz appealed the resolution to the Executive Central\n\nCommittee of UIA, which affirmed the proposed disciplinary measures.\n\nCruz avers that throughout the course of these proceedings he was\n\ndeclared \"persona non grata\" by the UIA.\n\n          In July 1992, Cruz filed a grievance with the Grievance\n\nCommittee of the AAA to protest the Union's decision requiring him to\n\njoin in order to keep his job.     The grievance was denied and, on\n\nOctober 11, 1993, AAA discharged Cruz for failing to comply with the\n\nunion membership requirement.2     Shortly thereafter, Cruz filed a\n\ndiscrimination complaint with the EEOC.\n\nB.   Proceedings below\n\n\n\n\n2 UIA has not argued that Cruz's resort to the employee grievance\nprocedure precludes the instant lawsuit. Cf. Wright v. Universal\nMaritime Serv. Corp., 525 U.S. 70 (1999) (holding that general\narbitration clause in a collective bargaining agreement did not require\nemployee to use arbitration procedure for alleged violation of federal\nantidiscrimination law); EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., No. 99-1823, 2002\nWL 46763, at *7-9 (U.S. Jan. 15, 2002) (holding that employee's\narbitration agreement does not prevent EEOC from initiating suit\nagainst the employer and seeking victim-specific relief).\n\n                                 -5-\n\f              The EEOC filed a complaint on December 27, 1996, alleging\n\nthat UIA had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\n\nU.S.C.   §§    2000e-2000e-17,    by   failing   to   provide   reasonable\n\naccommodation to Cruz's religious beliefs and by causing AAA to\n\nterminate Cruz's employment. The complaint sought both monetary and\n\ninjunctive relief from UIA.         The complaint also named AAA as a\n\ndefendant under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19 to ensure that\n\ncomplete relief, including Cruz's reinstatement, was available. AAA\n\nthen filed a cross-claim against UIA, seeking reimbursement from UIA\n\nfor any costs or damages AAA might be ordered to pay pursuant to the\n\ncourt's resolution of the Title VII claims.3\n\n              The EEOC moved for summary judgment as to liability, arguing\n\nthat the undisputed evidence established that, after Cruz informed the\n\nUIA of his religiously based opposition to union membership, UIA\n\nsecured his discharge from employment under the union security clause,\n\n3 The collective bargaining agreement between UIA and AAA contained a\nprovision mandating that UIA will indemnify AAA for any liability the\nemployer may incur due to the enforcement of the union security clause.\nThis appeal does not require us to pass on the sticky question of\nwhether such agreements are enforceable as a matter of public policy.\nCompare Stamford Bd. of Ed. v. Stamford Ed. Ass'n, 697 F.2d 70, 72-75\n(2d Cir. 1982) (holding that indemnification clauses in collective\nbargaining agreements which purport to relieve public employers from\nliability for violations of federal constitutional and civil rights are\nvoid as against public policy), and Weaver v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 970\nF.2d 1523, 1536-38 (6th Cir. 1992) (same), with Hohe v. Casey, 956 F.2d\n399, 411-12 (3d Cir. 1992) (upholding indemnity agreement providing\nthat union would hold public employer harmless on any and all claims,\nsuits, orders, or judgments against employer as a result of action\ntaken with respect to union security clause).\n\n                                    -6-\n\fand failed to present evidence demonstrating that accommodating Cruz's\n\nreligious beliefs would cause UIA undue hardship. UIA opposed the\n\nEEOC's motion on the ground that there remained disputed issues of fact\n\nwith regard to the prima facie case of discrimination. UIA also filed\n\nits own motion for summary judgment.4      On December 14, 1998, the\n\ndistrict court granted the EEOC's motion for partial summary judgment\n\nand denied UIA's motion.     See EEOC v. Unión Independiente de la\n\nAutoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, 30 F. Supp. 2d 217 (D.P.R.\n\n1998).\n\n          On September 26, 2000, the district court ruled on the\n\nremaining issue of damages, awarding the plaintiff $133,136.42 \"in\n\ncompounded prejudgment interest and backpay.\"       The court entered\n\njudgment on October 10, 2000, ordering that \"the case be dismissed.\"\n\nOn the same day, the EEOC filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 59 to vacate the judgment and to enter judgment \"for\n\ninjunctive relief in addition to the back pay previously awarded.\" On\n\nOctober 24, while the EEOC's motion was still pending, UIA filed its\n\nnotice of appeal from the October 10 judgment. On November 14, 2000,\n\nthe district court entered an order agreeing with the EEOC that\n\n\n4 UIA argued that it was entitled to summary judgment on the grounds\nthat it had indisputably made a reasonable accommodation for each of\nCruz's objections to certain membership requirements, that Cruz's\nproposed accommodation of an exemption from membership was unreasonable\nand an undue burden, and that the religious accommodation provisions of\nTitle VII violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. UIA has\nalso pressed these arguments in this appeal.\n\n                                 -7-\n\finjunctive relief should be added to the damages award previously\n\nordered.   The court entered an \"Amended Judgment Nunc pro Tunc,\"\n\nordering Cruz's reinstatement in his former or equivalent position and\n\nan injunction forbidding UIA from discriminating on the basis of\n\nreligion or retaliating against any employee for filing a charge on the\n\nbasis of religion.    UIA did not file a separate notice of appeal\n\nfollowing the entry of the amended judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f                            II.   ANALYSIS\n\nA.   Jurisdictional issues\n\n          The EEOC attempts to short-circuit UIA's appeal from the\n\noutset by pressing two challenges to our jurisdiction. Though we find\n\nneither challenge persuasive, we briefly address these threshold issues\n\nbefore moving to the merits of the appeal.\n\n          The EEOC first draws our attention to timing of UIA's notice\n\nof appeal.   UIA filed its notice after the EEOC filed its Rule 59\n\nmotion, but before the district court acted upon it. Stating \"it is\n\nnot clear\" that we have jurisdiction over this appeal under these\n\ncircumstances, the EEOC seems to intimate that UIA's notice was\n\nnullified by the EEOC's subsequent filing of a Rule 59 motion. This\n\nargument is simply anachronistic, invoking a rule followed under the\n\npre-1993 version of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. See Fed.\n\nR. App. P. 4(a)(4) (1988) (superseded) (\"A notice of appeal filed\n\nbefore the disposition of [a motion under Rule 59] shall have no\n\neffect\"); Osterneck v. Ernst & Whitney, 489 U.S. 169, 177 (1989)\n\n(holding that notice of appeal filed during pendency of Rule 59 motion\n\nwas ineffective to confer appellate jurisdiction). Under the version\n\nof Rule 4 currently in effect,\n\n          [i]f a party files a notice of appeal after the\n          court announces or enters a judgment -- but\n          before it disposes of [a motion under Rule 59] --\n          the notice becomes effective to appeal a judgment\n          or order, in whole or in part, when the order\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          disposing of the last such remaining motion is\n          entered.\n\nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(i) (1998). The newer rule eliminates the\n\nprior rule's procedural \"trap for an unsuspecting litigant who files a\n\nnotice of appeal before a posttrial motion or while a posttrial motion\n\nis pending.\" Fed. R. App. P. 4, Advisory Committee Notes (1993).\n\nUIA's notice of appeal therefore properly invokes our jurisdiction,\n\nnotwithstanding the EEOC's later motion under Rule 59.\n\n          The EEOC also suggests that we lack appellate jurisdiction\n\nbecause the district court's October 10, 2000, judgment designated in\n\nUIA's notice of appeal does not reflect the finding of liability in the\n\ndistrict court's September 26, 2000, opinion and order. This argument\n\nis without merit. We have \"uniformly held that a notice of appeal that\n\ndesignates the final judgment encompasses not only that judgment, but\n\nalso all earlier interlocutory orders that merge in the judgment.\"5 See\n\nJohn's Insulation, Inc. v. L. Addison & Assocs., 156 F.3d 101, 105 (1st\n\nCir. 1998). The October 10 order was accompanied by a docket entry\n\nordering the case closed; this entry of judgment clearly disposed of\n\n\n\n\n5 We do not, however, have jurisdiction to entertain any challenges to\nthe district court's modification of the judgment in response to the\nEEOC's Rule 59 motion. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii) (requiring\nparty to amend notice of appeal in order to challenge orders disposing\nof motions under Rule 59). No such challenge appears to be asserted by\nUIA.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe entire case.6 See generally Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229,\n\n233 (1945) (stating that an appealable final decision generally is one\n\nwhich \"ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the\n\ncourt to do but execute the judgment\"). UIA's appeal from the district\n\ncourt's ruling of October 10, 2000, therefore supports review of the\n\nearlier orders.\n\nB.   Title VII\n\n          Having dispensed with the EEOC's jurisdictional arguments,\n\nwe now turn to UIA's argument that the district court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the EEOC on the issue of liability under\n\nTitle VII.\n\n          Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\" Barbour v. Dynamics Research Corp., 63\n\nF.3d 32, 36 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).       The\n\nrecord evidence must be construed \"in the light most favorable to, and\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of, the nonmoving party.\"\n\nFeliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort & Country Club, 218 F.3d\n\n\n\n6 Evidently, this was also the EEOC's understanding, since it filed its\nRule 59 motion in response to the court's October 10, 2000, order. See\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) (providing for motions to alter or amend a\njudgment).\n\n                                 -11-\n\f1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000). Where, as is the case here, the party moving for\n\nsummary judgment bears the burden of proof on an issue, he cannot\n\nprevail \"unless the evidence that he provides on that issue is\n\nconclusive.\" Torres-Vargas v. Santiago-Cummings, 149 F.3d 29, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 1998) (emphasis added); see also Calderone v. United States, 799\n\nF.2d 254, 258 (6th Cir. 1986) (explaining that if a summary judgment\n\nmovant has the burden of proof, \"his showing must be sufficient for the\n\ncourt to hold that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than\n\nfor the moving party\") (citation and emphasis omitted); Fontenot v.\n\nUpjohn Co., 780 F.2d 1190, 1194 (5th Cir. 1986) (\"[I]f the movant bears\n\nthe burden of proof on an issue, either because he is the plaintiff or\n\nas a defendant he is asserting an affirmative defense, he must\n\nestablish beyond peradventure all of the essential elements of the\n\nclaim or defense to warrant judgment in his favor.\") (emphasis in\n\noriginal). We review the district court's ruling on summary judgment\n\nde novo. Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 250 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n          Title VII forbids a labor organization \"to exclude or to\n\nexpel from its membership, or otherwise to discriminate against, any\n\nindividual because of his . . . religion . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(c)(1). The statute defines the term \"religion\" to include: \"all\n\naspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless\n\nan employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fan employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or\n\npractice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's\n\nbusiness.\" Id. § 2000e(j).7 Thus, in general terms, Title VII requires\n\nemployers and labor organizations to accommodate, within reasonable\n\nlimits, the bona fide religious beliefs and practices of employees.\n\n          In order to establish a prima facie case of religious\n\ndiscrimination based on a failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must\n\nshow that \"(1) a bona fide religious practice conflicts with an\n\nemployment requirement, (2) he or she brought the practice to the\n\n[Union's] attention, and (3) the religious practice was the basis for\n\nthe adverse employment decision.\" EEOC v. United Parcel Serv., 94 F.3d\n\n314, 317 (7th Cir. 1996); see also Seaworth v. Pearson, 203 F.3d 1056,\n\n1057 (8th Cir.) (per curiam), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 895 (2000). Once\n\nthe plaintiff has established this prima facie case, the burden shifts\n\nto the union to show that it made a reasonable accommodation of the\n\nreligious practice or show that any accommodation would result in undue\n\nhardship. Seaworth, 203 F.3d at 1057; Tiano v. Dillard Dep't Stores,\n\nInc., 139 F.3d 679, 682 (9th Cir. 1998).\n\n\n\n\n7  Read literally, Title VII addresses only the obligation of an\n\"employer\" to accommodate an employee's religious beliefs and\nobservances. However, courts have uniformly imposed upon labor\norganizations the same duty to provide reasonable accommodations. See,\ne.g., Lutcher v. Musicians Local 47, 633 F.2d 880, 884 (9th Cir. 1981).\nWe follow the same approach here.\n\n                                 -13-\n\f          UIA argues that the district court erroneously granted\n\nsummary judgment where there remained disputed issues of fact with\n\nrespect to the question of whether Cruz's objection to union membership\n\nwas the product of a \"bona fide religious belief,\" an element of the\n\nclaim for which the EEOC bears the burden of proof. In support of this\n\nargument UIA points to record evidence tending to show that Cruz has,\n\non more than a few occasions, taken actions that are at odds with his\n\nprofessed faith.\n\n          The requirement that the employee have a \"bona fide religious\n\nbelief\" is an essential element of a religious accommodation claim.\n\nTitle VII does not mandate an employer or labor organization to\n\naccommodate what amounts to a \"purely personal preference.\" Vetter v.\n\nFarmland Indus., Inc., 120 F.3d 749, 751 (8th Cir. 1997). In order to\n\nsatisfy this element, the plaintiff must demonstrate both that the\n\nbelief or practice is religious and that it is sincerely held. See\n\nRedmond v. GAF Corp., 574 F.2d 897, 901 n.12 (7th Cir. 1978); cf. also\n\nHager v. Sec. of Air Force, 938 F.2d 1449, 1454 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting\n\nsimilar test for determining whether an applicant is entitled to an\n\nexemption from military service as a conscientious objector).\n\n          As noted above, Title VII's capacious definition of\n\n\"religion\" includes \"all aspects of religious observance and practice,\n\nas well as belief . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j); see also 29 C.F.R. §\n\n1605.1 (\"[R]eligious practices . . . include moral or ethical beliefs\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fas to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the\n\nstrength of traditional religious views.\").        Religious beliefs\n\nprotected by Title VII need not be \"acceptable, logical, consistent, or\n\ncomprehensible to others . . . .\"       Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind.\n\nEmployment Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981). The statute thus\n\nleaves little room for a party to challenge the religious nature of an\n\nemployee's professed beliefs.     Plus, in this case, the religious\n\nfoundation of the Seventh-Day Adventist faith's opposition to union\n\nmembership has long been recognized in the opinions of this court and\n\nthose of our sister circuits. See Linscott v. Millers Falls Co., 440\n\nF.2d 14, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1971); see also McDaniel v. Essex Int'l, Inc.,\n\n696 F.2d 34, 37 (6th Cir. 1982); Tooley v. Martin-Marietta Corp., 648\n\nF.2d 1239, 1241 (9th Cir. 1981); Nottelson v. Smith Steel Workers\n\nD.A.L.U. 19806, 643 F.2d 445, 448 (7th Cir. 1981). The religious\n\nnature of Cruz's professed belief therefore cannot seriously be\n\ndisputed, nor has UIA mounted such a challenge.\n\n          Yet, \"[w]hile the 'truth' of a belief is not open to\n\nquestion, there remains the significant question of whether it is\n\n'truly held.'\" United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 185 (1965). The\n\nelement of sincerity is fundamental, since \"if the religious beliefs\n\nthat apparently prompted a request are not sincerely held, there has\n\nbeen no showing of a religious observance or practice that conflicts\n\nwith an employment requirement.\" EEOC v. Ilona of Hungary, Inc., 108\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fF.3d 1569, 1575 (7th Cir. 1997). The finding on this issue generally\n\nwill depend on the factfinder's assessment of the employee's\n\ncredibility. See id.; Nottelson, 643 F.2d at 454. Credibility issues\n\nsuch as the sincerity of an employee's religious belief are\n\nquintessential fact questions. As such, they ordinarily should be\n\nreserved \"for the factfinder at trial, not for the court at summary\n\njudgment.\" Simas v. First Citizens' Fed. Credit Union, 170 F.3d 37, 49\n\n(1st Cir. 1999); see also 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &\n\nMary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2726, at 446 (3d ed.\n\n1998) (\"Clearly, if the credibility of the movant's witnesses is\n\nchallenged by the opposing party and specific bases for possible\n\nimpeachment are shown, summary judgment should be denied and the case\n\nallowed to proceed to trial\") (footnote omitted).\n\n          In this case, UIA has by no means conceded that Cruz's\n\nopposition to union membership was the product of a sincerely held\n\nbelief.   Instead, it has adduced specific undisputed evidence of\n\nconduct on Cruz's part that is contrary to the tenets of his professed\n\nreligious belief. For example, there is record evidence that Cruz lied\n\non an employment application; that he is divorced; that he took an oath\n\nbefore a notary upon becoming a public employee; and that he works five\n\ndays a week (instead of the six days required by his faith). Evidence\n\ntending to show that an employee acted in a manner inconsistent with\n\nhis professed religious belief is, of course, relevant to the\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\ffactfinder's evaluation of sincerity. See Philbrook v. Ansonia Bd. of\n\nEd., 757 F.2d 476, 482 (2d Cir. 1985), aff'd on other grounds, 479 U.S.\n\n60 (1986). UIA also points to disputed evidence that, when viewed in\n\nthe light most favorable to UIA, shows that the alleged conflict\n\nbetween Cruz's beliefs and union membership was a moving target: at\n\nfirst, Cruz objected only to certain membership requirements, and he\n\nonly voiced his opposition to any form of union membership after UIA\n\nagreed to accommodate him with respect to each practice he had\n\nidentified earlier. Such evidence, if credited by the factfinder,\n\ncould also bear on the sincerity of Cruz's beliefs.8 We therefore\n\nconclude that UIA raised a triable issue of fact, making summary\n\njudgment inappropriate.\n\n          To be sure, assessing the bona fides of an employee's\n\nreligious belief is a delicate business.       On the one hand, the\n\ndefendant is entitled to hold the plaintiff to his burden, making it\n\n\"entirely appropriate, indeed necessary, for a court to engage in\n\nanalysis of the sincerity of someone's religious beliefs . . . .\"\n\nProtos v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 797 F.2d 129, 137 (3d Cir. 1986)\n\n(quoting Philbrook, 757 F.2d at 481). On the other hand, \"[s]incerity\n\nanalysis is exceedingly amorphous, requiring the factfinder to delve\n\ninto the [employee's] most veiled motivations and vigilantly separate\n\n8 Though, viewed differently, such evidence might simply reflect an\nevolution in Cruz's religious views toward a more steadfast opposition\nto union membership.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fthe issue of sincerity from the factfinder's perception of the\n\nreligious nature of the [employee's] beliefs.\" Patrick v. LeFevre, 745\n\nF.2d 153, 157 (2d Cir. 1984). Thus, at trial the court must be careful\n\nin separating the verity and sincerity of an employee's beliefs in\n\norder to prevent the verdict from turning on \"the factfinder's own idea\n\nof what a religion should resemble.\"     Philbrook, 757 F.2d at 482\n\n(quoting L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 14-11, at 861 (1979)).\n\nWe believe that a jury, acting under proper instructions from the trial\n\njudge, is fully capable of evaluating the parties' evidence and making\n\nthe appropriate factual determination.9\n\n                          III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          Because we conclude that the district court erroneously\n\ngranted summary judgment with regard to the element of a bona fide\n\nreligious belief, we decline to address UIA's remaining arguments on\n\nappeal and express no view as to their merits.\n\n          Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n9 While the record does not directly disclose whether the parties\nintended for the case to proceed to a jury trial or a bench trial, the\nEEOC stated at oral argument that its usual practice is to try cases\nbefore a jury.

Events leading to the claim of discrimination</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David Cruz-Carrillo (\"Cruz\") is a member of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church who claims that the tenets of his religion prohibit him from joining a labor organization. Cruz was hired by the Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"AAA\") as a temporary employee in 1986. When he applied for employment with AAA, he never disclosed that his religious beliefs forbid him from becoming a member of a labor organization. However, his application for employment at AAA reveals that Cruz attended Seventh-Day Adventist schools and graduated from a Seventh-Day Adventist college.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Uni&#243;n Independiente de la Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (\"UIA\" or \"Union\") is a labor organization created in accordance with the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Act, 29 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 61-76. UIA represents several categories of employees, including operations and maintenance workers of AAA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> UIA maintained a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with AAA that contains a union security clause, pursuant to which all permanent employees of the appropriate bargaining unit must belong to the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 5, 1988, Cruz became a permanent employee of AAA. He was given written notification of the conditions under which he would be employed, including his obligation to join UIA and pay union dues. According to UIA, Cruz did not state his objection to union membership outright at that time. Instead, he objected only to specific union practices, each of which UIA contends it was willing to accommodate. For example, Cruz objected at various points to attending Saturday union meetings, joining union demonstrations or strikes, taking the Union's loyalty oath, and paying union dues. Through a series of correspondence, meetings, and administrative procedures, UIA expressed its willingness to exempt Cruz from Saturday meetings and public strikes or picketing, to paraphrase its loyalty oath to an affirmation, and to transfer his dues to a nonprofit organization (but retain the share used to pay his fringe benefits). Only after Cruz rejected these proposals, contends UIA, did he assert his objection to union membership in any form. Cruz disputes this version of events and maintains that his opposition to union membership was steadfast and unqualified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, 1991, the Board of Directors of UIA initiated disciplinary proceedings against Cruz for his refusal to become a UIA member. At the end of these proceedings, UIA requested that AAA suspend Cruz from employment in accordance with the union security clause. Cruz appealed the resolution to the Executive Central Committee of UIA, which affirmed the proposed disciplinary measures. Cruz avers that throughout the course of these proceedings he was declared \"persona non grata\" by the UIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1992, Cruz filed a grievance with the Grievance Committee of the AAA to protest the Union's decision requiring him to join in order to keep his job. The grievance was denied and, on October 11, 1993, AAA discharged Cruz for failing to comply with the union membership requirement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Shortly thereafter, Cruz filed a discrimination complaint with the EEOC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Proceedings below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC filed a complaint on December 27, 1996, alleging that UIA had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e-2000e-17, by failing to provide reasonable accommodation to Cruz's religious beliefs and by causing AAA to terminate Cruz's employment. The complaint sought both monetary and injunctive relief from UIA. The complaint also named AAA as a defendant under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19 to ensure that complete relief, including Cruz's reinstatement, was available. AAA then filed a cross-claim against UIA, seeking reimbursement from UIA for any costs or damages AAA might be ordered to pay pursuant to the court's resolution of the Title VII claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC moved for summary judgment as to liability, arguing that the undisputed evidence established that, after Cruz informed the UIA of his religiously based opposition to union membership, UIA secured his discharge from employment under the union security clause, and failed to present evidence demonstrating that accommodating Cruz's religious beliefs would cause UIA undue hardship. UIA opposed the EEOC's motion on the ground that there remained disputed issues of fact with regard to the prima facie case of discrimination. UIA also filed its own motion for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On December 14, 1998, the district court granted the EEOC's motion for partial summary judgment and denied UIA's motion. <i>See EEOC v. Uni&#243;n Independiente de la Autoridad de Acueductos Y Alcantarillados,</i> 30 F.Supp.2d 217 (D.P.R.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 26, 2000, the district court ruled on the remaining issue of damages, awarding the plaintiff $133,136.42 \"in compounded prejudgment interest and backpay.\" The court entered judgment on October 10, 2000, ordering that \"the case be dismissed.\" On the same day, the EEOC filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 to vacate the judgment and to enter judgment \"for injunctive relief in addition to the back pay previously awarded.\" On October 24, while the EEOC's motion was still pending, UIA filed its notice of appeal from the October 10 judgment. On November 14, 2000, the district court entered an order agreeing with the EEOC that injunctive relief should be added to the damages award previously ordered. The court entered an \"Amended Judgment Nunc pro Tunc,\" ordering Cruz's reinstatement in his former or equivalent position and an injunction forbidding UIA from discriminating on the basis of religion or retaliating against any employee for filing a charge on the basis of religion. UIA did not file a separate notice of appeal following the entry of the amended judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Jurisdictional issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC attempts to short-circuit UIA's appeal from the outset by pressing two challenges to our jurisdiction. Though we find neither challenge persuasive, we briefly address these threshold issues before moving to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC first draws our attention to timing of UIA's notice of appeal. UIA filed its notice after the EEOC filed its Rule 59 motion, but before the district court acted upon it. Stating \"it is not clear\" that we have jurisdiction over this appeal under these circumstances, the EEOC seems to intimate that UIA's notice was nullified by the EEOC's subsequent filing of a Rule 59 motion. This argument is simply anachronistic, invoking a rule followed under the pre-1993 version of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4) (1988) (superseded) (\"A notice of appeal filed before the disposition of [a motion under Rule 59] shall have no effect\"); <i>Osterneck v. Ernst &amp; Whinney,</i> 489 U.S. 169, 177, 109 S.Ct. 987, 103 L.Ed.2d 146 (1989) (holding that notice of appeal filed during pendency of Rule 59 motion was ineffective to confer appellate jurisdiction). Under the version of Rule 4 currently in effect,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]f a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a judgment &#8212; but before it disposes of [a motion under Rule 59] &#8212; the notice becomes effective to appeal a judgment or order, in whole or in part, when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(i) (1998). The newer rule eliminates the prior rule's procedural \"trap for an unsuspecting litigant who files a notice of appeal before a posttrial motion or while a posttrial motion is pending.\" Fed. R.App. P. 4, Advisory Committee Notes (1993). UIA's notice of appeal therefore properly invokes our jurisdiction, notwithstanding the EEOC's later motion under Rule 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC also suggests that we lack appellate jurisdiction because the district court's October 10, 2000, judgment designated in UIA's notice of appeal does not reflect the finding of liability in the district court's September 26, 2000, opinion and order. This argument is without merit. We have \"uniformly held that a notice of appeal that designates the final judgment encompasses not only that judgment, but also all earlier interlocutory orders that merge in the judgment.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See John's Insulation, Inc. v. L. Addison &amp; Assocs.,</i> 156 F.3d 101, 105 (1st Cir.1998). The October 10 order was accompanied by a docket entry ordering the case closed; this entry of judgment clearly disposed of the entire case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See generally Catlin v. United States,</i> 324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945) (stating that an appealable final decision generally is one which \"ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment\"). UIA's appeal from the district court's ruling of October 10, 2000, therefore supports review of the earlier orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Title VII</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having dispensed with the EEOC's jurisdictional arguments, we now turn to UIA's argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the EEOC on the issue of liability under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Barbour v. Dynamics Research Corp.,</i> 63 F.3d 32, 36 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). The record evidence must be construed \"in the light most favorable to, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of, the nonmoving party.\" <i>Feliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort &amp; Country Club,</i> 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000). Where, as is the case here, the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of proof on an issue, he cannot prevail \"unless the evidence that he provides on that issue is <i>conclusive.</i>\" <i>Torres Vargas v. Santiago Cummings,</i> 149 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir.1998) (emphasis added); <i>see also Calderone v. United States,</i> 799 F.2d 254, 258 (6th Cir.1986) (explaining that if a summary judgment movant has the burden of proof, \"his showing must be sufficient for the court to hold that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving party\") (citation and emphasis omitted); <i>Fontenot v. Upjohn Co.,</i> 780 F.2d 1190, 1194 (5th Cir.1986) (\"[I]f the movant bears the burden of proof on an issue, either because he is the plaintiff or as a defendant he is asserting an affirmative defense, he must establish beyond peradventure <i>all</i> of the essential elements of the claim or defense to warrant judgment in his favor.\") (emphasis in original). We review the district court's ruling on summary judgment de novo. <i>Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 250 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII forbids a labor organization \"to exclude or to expel from its membership, or otherwise to discriminate against, any individual because of his ... religion....\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(c)(1). The statute defines the term \"religion\" to include: \"all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2000e(j).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Thus, in general terms, Title VII requires employers and labor organizations to accommodate, within reasonable limits, the bona fide religious beliefs and practices of employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish a prima facie case of religious discrimination based on a failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must show that \"(1) a bona fide religious practice conflicts with an employment requirement, (2) he or she brought the practice to the [Union's] attention, and (3) the religious practice was the basis for the adverse employment decision.\" <i>EEOC v. United Parcel Serv.,</i> 94 F.3d 314, 317 (7th Cir.1996); <i>see also Seaworth v. Pearson,</i> 203 F.3d 1056, 1057 (8th Cir.) (per curiam), <i>cert. denied,</i> 531 U.S. 895, 121 S.Ct. 226, 148 L.Ed.2d 160 (2000). Once the plaintiff has established this prima facie case, the burden shifts to the union to show that it made a reasonable accommodation of the religious practice or show that any accommodation would result in undue hardship. <i>Seaworth,</i> 203 F.3d at 1057; <i>Tiano v. Dillard Dep't Stores, Inc.,</i> 139 F.3d 679, 682 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UIA argues that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment where there remained disputed issues of fact with respect to the question of whether Cruz's objection to union membership was the product of a \"bona fide religious belief,\" an element of the claim for which the EEOC bears the burden of proof. In support of this argument UIA points to record evidence tending to show that Cruz has, on more than a few occasions, taken actions that are at odds with his professed faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement that the employee have a \"bona fide religious belief\" is an essential element of a religious accommodation claim. Title VII does not mandate an employer or labor organization to accommodate what amounts to a \"purely personal preference.\" <i>Vetter v. Farmland Indus., Inc.,</i> 120 F.3d 749, 751 (8th Cir.1997). In order to satisfy this element, the plaintiff must demonstrate both that the belief or practice is religious and that it is sincerely held. <i>See Redmond v. GAF Corp.,</i> 574 F.2d 897, 901 n. 12 (7th Cir.1978); <i>cf. also Hager v. Sec. of Air Force,</i> 938 F.2d 1449, 1454 (1st Cir.1991) (noting similar test for determining whether an applicant is entitled to an exemption from military service as a conscientious objector).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, Title VII's capacious definition of \"religion\" includes \"all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief....\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(j); <i>see also</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1605.1 (\"[R]eligious practices ... include moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views.\"). Religious beliefs protected by Title VII need not be \"acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others....\" <i>Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Sec. Div.,</i> 450 U.S. 707, 714, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981). The statute thus leaves little room for a party to challenge the religious nature of an employee's professed beliefs. Plus, in this case, the religious foundation of the Seventh-Day Adventist faith's opposition to union membership has long been recognized in the opinions of this court and those of our sister circuits. <i>See Linscott v. Millers Falls Co.,</i> 440 F.2d 14, 15-16 (1st Cir.1971); <i>see also McDaniel v. Essex Int'l, Inc.,</i> 696 F.2d 34, 37 (6th Cir.1982); <i>Tooley v. Martin-Marietta Corp.,</i> 648 F.2d 1239, 1241 (9th Cir.1981); <i>Nottelson v. Smith Steel Workers D.A.L.U. 19806,</i> 643 F.2d 445, 448 (7th Cir.1981). The religious nature of Cruz's professed belief therefore cannot seriously be disputed, nor has UIA mounted such a challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, \"[w]hile the `truth' of a belief is not open to question, there remains the significant question of whether it is `truly held.'\" <i>United States v. Seeger,</i> 380 U.S. 163, 185, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965). The element of sincerity is fundamental, since \"if the religious beliefs that apparently prompted a request are not sincerely held, there has been no showing of a religious observance or practice that conflicts with an employment requirement.\" <i>EEOC v. Ilona of Hungary, Inc.,</i> 108 F.3d 1569, 1575 (7th Cir.1997). The finding on this issue generally will depend on the factfinder's assessment of the employee's credibility. <i>See id.; Nottelson,</i> 643 F.2d at 454. Credibility issues such as the sincerity of an employee's religious belief are quintessential fact questions. As such, they ordinarily should be reserved \"for the factfinder at trial, not for the court at summary judgment.\" <i>Simas v. First Citizens' Fed. Credit Union,</i> 170 F.3d 37, 49 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see also</i> 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 2726, at 446 (3d ed. 1998) (\"Clearly, if the credibility of the movant's witnesses is challenged by the opposing party and specific bases for possible impeachment are shown, summary judgment should be denied and the case allowed to proceed to trial\") (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, UIA has by no means conceded that Cruz's opposition to union membership was the product of a sincerely held belief. Instead, it has adduced specific undisputed evidence of conduct on Cruz's part that is contrary to the tenets of his professed religious belief. For example, there is record evidence that Cruz lied on an employment application; that he is divorced; that he took an oath before a notary upon becoming a public employee; and that he works five days a week (instead of the six days required by his faith). Evidence tending to show that an employee acted in a manner inconsistent with his professed religious belief is, of course, relevant to the factfinder's evaluation of sincerity. <i>See Philbrook v. Ansonia Bd. of Ed.,</i> 757 F.2d 476, 482 (2d Cir.1985), <i>aff'd on other grounds,</i> 479 U.S. 60, 107 S.Ct. 367, 93 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986). UIA also points to disputed evidence that, when viewed in the light most favorable to UIA, shows that the alleged conflict between Cruz's beliefs and union membership was a moving target: at first, Cruz objected only to certain membership requirements, and he only voiced his opposition to any form of union membership after UIA agreed to accommodate him with respect to each practice he had identified earlier. Such evidence, if credited by the factfinder, could also bear on the sincerity of Cruz's beliefs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> We therefore conclude that UIA raised a triable issue of fact, making summary judgment inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, assessing the bona fides of an employee's religious belief is a delicate business. On the one hand, the defendant is entitled to hold the plaintiff to his burden, making it \"entirely appropriate, indeed necessary, for a court to engage in analysis of the sincerity of someone's religious beliefs....\" <i>Protos v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,</i> 797 F.2d 129, 137 (3d Cir.1986) (quoting <i>Philbrook,</i> 757 F.2d at 481). On the other hand, \"[s]incerity analysis is exceedingly amorphous, requiring the factfinder to delve into the [employee's] most veiled motivations and vigilantly separate the issue of sincerity from the factfinder's perception of the religious nature of the [employee's] beliefs.\" <i>Patrick v. LeFevre,</i> 745 F.2d 153, 157 (2d Cir.1984). Thus, at trial the court must be careful in separating the verity and sincerity of an employee's beliefs in order to prevent the verdict from turning on \"the factfinder's own idea of what a religion should resemble.\" <i>Philbrook,</i> 757 F.2d at 482 (quoting L. Tribe, <i>American Constitutional Law</i> &#167; 14-11, at 861 (1979)). We believe that a jury, acting under proper instructions from the trial judge, is fully capable of evaluating the parties' evidence and making the appropriate factual determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Events leading to the claim of discrimination</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David Cruz-Carrillo (\"Cruz\") is a member of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church who claims that the tenets of his religion prohibit him from joining a labor organization. Cruz was hired by the Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"AAA\") as a temporary employee in 1986. When he applied for employment with AAA, he never disclosed that his religious beliefs forbid him from becoming a member of a labor organization. However, his application for employment at AAA reveals that Cruz attended Seventh-Day Adventist schools and graduated from a Seventh-Day Adventist college.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Uni&#243;n Independiente de la Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (\"UIA\" or \"Union\") is a labor organization created in accordance with the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Act, 29 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 61-76. UIA represents several categories of employees, including operations and maintenance workers of AAA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> UIA maintained a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with AAA that contains a union security clause, pursuant to which all permanent employees of the appropriate bargaining unit must belong to the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 5, 1988, Cruz became a permanent employee of AAA. He was given written notification of the conditions under which he would be employed, including his obligation to join UIA and pay union dues. According to UIA, Cruz did not state his objection to union membership outright at that time. Instead, he objected only to specific union practices, each of which UIA contends it was willing to accommodate. For example, Cruz objected at various points to attending Saturday union meetings, joining union demonstrations or strikes, taking the Union's loyalty oath, and paying union dues. Through a series of correspondence, meetings, and administrative procedures, UIA expressed its willingness to exempt Cruz from Saturday meetings and public strikes or picketing, to paraphrase its loyalty oath to an affirmation, and to transfer his dues to a nonprofit organization (but retain the share used to pay his fringe benefits). Only after Cruz rejected these proposals, contends UIA, did he assert his objection to union membership in any form. Cruz disputes this version of events and maintains that his opposition to union membership was steadfast and unqualified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, 1991, the Board of Directors of UIA initiated disciplinary proceedings against Cruz for his refusal to become a UIA member. At the end of these proceedings, UIA requested that AAA suspend Cruz from employment in accordance with the union security clause. Cruz appealed the resolution to the Executive Central Committee of UIA, which affirmed the proposed disciplinary measures. Cruz avers that throughout the course of these proceedings he was declared \"persona non grata\" by the UIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1992, Cruz filed a grievance with the Grievance Committee of the AAA to protest the Union's decision requiring him to join in order to keep his job. The grievance was denied and, on October 11, 1993, AAA discharged Cruz for failing to comply with the union membership requirement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Shortly thereafter, Cruz filed a discrimination complaint with the EEOC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Proceedings below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC filed a complaint on December 27, 1996, alleging that UIA had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e-2000e-17, by failing to provide reasonable accommodation to Cruz's religious beliefs and by causing AAA to terminate Cruz's employment. The complaint sought both monetary and injunctive relief from UIA. The complaint also named AAA as a defendant under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19 to ensure that complete relief, including Cruz's reinstatement, was available. AAA then filed a cross-claim against UIA, seeking reimbursement from UIA for any costs or damages AAA might be ordered to pay pursuant to the court's resolution of the Title VII claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC moved for summary judgment as to liability, arguing that the undisputed evidence established that, after Cruz informed the UIA of his religiously based opposition to union membership, UIA secured his discharge from employment under the union security clause, and failed to present evidence demonstrating that accommodating Cruz's religious beliefs would cause UIA undue hardship. UIA opposed the EEOC's motion on the ground that there remained disputed issues of fact with regard to the prima facie case of discrimination. UIA also filed its own motion for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On December 14, 1998, the district court granted the EEOC's motion for partial summary judgment and denied UIA's motion. <i>See EEOC v.

On November 14, 2000, the district court entered an order agreeing with the EEOC that injunctive relief should be added to the damages award previously ordered. The court entered an \"Amended Judgment Nunc pro Tunc,\" ordering Cruz's reinstatement in his former or equivalent position and an injunction forbidding UIA from discriminating on the basis of religion or retaliating against any employee for filing a charge on the basis of religion. UIA did not file a separate notice of appeal following the entry of the amended judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

UIA filed its notice after the EEOC filed its Rule 59 motion, but before the district court acted upon it. Stating \"it is not clear\" that we have jurisdiction over this appeal under these circumstances, the EEOC seems to intimate that UIA's notice was nullified by the EEOC's subsequent filing of a Rule 59 motion. This argument is simply anachronistic, invoking a rule followed under the pre-1993 version of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4) (1988) (superseded) (\"A notice of appeal filed before the disposition of [a motion under Rule 59] shall have no effect\"); <i>Osterneck v.

The finding on this issue generally will depend on the factfinder's assessment of the employee's credibility. <i>See id.; Nottelson,</i> 643 F.2d at 454.

Instead, it has adduced specific undisputed evidence of conduct on Cruz's part that is contrary to the tenets of his professed religious belief. For example, there is record evidence that Cruz lied on an employment application; that he is divorced; that he took an oath before a notary upon becoming a public employee; and that he works five days a week (instead of the six days required by his faith). Evidence tending to show that an employee acted in a manner inconsistent with his professed religious belief is, of course, relevant to the factfinder's evaluation of sincerity. <i>See Philbrook v.

UIA also points to disputed evidence that, when viewed in the light most favorable to UIA, shows that the alleged conflict between Cruz's beliefs and union membership was a moving target: at first, Cruz objected only to certain membership requirements, and he only voiced his opposition to any form of union membership after UIA agreed to accommodate him with respect to each practice he had identified earlier. Such evidence, if credited by the factfinder, could also bear on the sincerity of Cruz's beliefs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> We therefore conclude that UIA raised a triable issue of fact, making summary judgment inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, assessing the bona fides of an employee's religious belief is a delicate business.

On the other hand, \"[s]incerity analysis is exceedingly amorphous, requiring the factfinder to delve into the [employee's] most veiled motivations and vigilantly separate the issue of sincerity from the factfinder's perception of the religious nature of the [employee's] beliefs.\" <i>Patrick v.
