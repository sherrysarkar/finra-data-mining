ROBERTS AND SHARON ROBERTS,\n\n                              Debtors,\n\n\n              EDMOND E. ROBERTS AND SHARON L.

Berman and Raskin & Berman on brief for appellants.\n     John Boyajian and Boyajian, Harrington & Richardson on brief\nfor appellee John Boyajian.\n\n\n\n\n                          February 8, 2002\n\f            CYR, Senior Circuit Judge. After appellants Edmond and\n\nSharon   Roberts,        husband    and       wife,      filed    their     chapter       13\n\npetition in 1993, the bankruptcy court confirmed their joint\n\nplan calling for (i) monthly payments of $474, to the chapter 13\n\ntrustee,    extending      over     a       five-year     period;      (ii)     a   $9,000\n\ndistribution    to   the     Internal         Revenue      Service       (IRS)      on   its\n\npriority prepetition income tax claim; and (iii) a ten percent\n\ndividend on all allowed unsecured claims.                      Several years later,\n\nIRS submitted supplemental claims asserting that Edmond Roberts\n\nhad continued to incur additional income tax obligations after\n\nthe chapter 13 proceeding was commenced, amounting to $15,000 by\n\n1996 and more than $53,000 by 1999.                       The chapter 13 trustee\n\nthereupon    successfully          moved          to    dismiss    the     chapter        13\n\nproceeding    due    to     the    debtors'            failure    to     make    payments\n\nsufficient to fund the confirmed plan, see Bankruptcy Code\n\n§   1307(c)(6);     11    U.S.C.        §    1307(c)(6),       thereby     effectively\n\nprecluding appellants from obtaining discharges of their debts.\n\nIn re Roberts, 247 B.R. 592, 594 (Bankr. D.R.I. 2000).\n\n            An order allowing a motion to dismiss pursuant to\n\nBankruptcy Code § 1307 is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Blaise v. Wolinsky (In re Blaise), 219 B.R. 946, 949-50\n\n(B.A.P. 2d Cir. 1998).        We review the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\n\ndecision     directly.             See       Brandt       v.     REPCO     Printers        &\n\n\n                                              2\n\fLithographics, Inc. (In re Healthco Int'l., Inc.), 132 F.3d 104,\n\n107 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n               Appellants contend on appeal that the Bankruptcy Code\n\nentitles them to a chapter 13 discharge, see 11 U.S.C. § 1328(a)\n\n(\"As soon as practicable after completion by the Debtor of all\n\npayments under the plan . . . the court shall grant the Debtor\n\na discharge . . . .\") (emphasis added), due to the fact that\n\nthey had paid the chapter 13 trustee the entire $28,440 required\n\nunder their confirmed plan ( i.e., sixty installments at $474 per\n\nmonth),    a    commitment   which   the    chapter   13   trustee    and   the\n\nbankruptcy court repeatedly reaffirmed even after the amount due\n\nthe IRS on its tax claims surpassed the $9,000 in cumulative\n\npayments required by the confirmed plan.\n\n               Appellants can cite no authority for their contention,\n\nsince the courts uniformly have held that a confirmed chapter 13\n\nplan provision requiring a fixed percentage return to unsecured\n\ncreditors       takes   precedence        over   a    companion      provision\n\nprescribing the aggregate payments to be made to the chapter 13\n\ntrustee.       See In re Carr, 159 B.R. 538, 543 (D. Neb. 1993); In\n\nre Delmonte, 237 B.R. 132, 137-38 (Bankr. E.D. Tex. 1999); In re\n\nGoude, 201 B.R. 275, 277 (Bankr. D. Ore. 1996); In re Guernsey,\n\n189 B.R. 477, 479 (Bankr. D. Minn. 1995); In re Rivera, 177 B.R.\n\n332, 335 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 1995); In re Phelps, 149 B.R. 534,\n\n\n                                      3\n\f537 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1993).1             More importantly, given these\n\nunanimous      authorities,   appellants           were   not   justified   in\n\nconstruing any alleged representation by the chapter 13 trustee\n\nand/or   the    bankruptcy    court       as   a    concession    that   their\n\ncompletion of the payment schedule prescribed in their confirmed\n\nplan relieved them of their clear responsibility to comply with\n\nthe other provisions in the plan, including their obligation to\n\npay all priority tax claims and a ten percent dividend on\n\nallowed unsecured claims.\n\n            Lastly, Sharon Roberts appeals from another bankruptcy\n\ncourt order which denied her request for a so-called \"hardship\n\ndischarge.\"     See 11 U.S.C. § 1328(b)(1) (\"[T]he court may grant\n\na discharge . . . if [t]he debtor's failure to complete such\n\n\n\n    1 Although the circumstances involved in these decisions\ndiffer slightly, each involved the same basic rationale; viz.,\nthat the plain language of section 1328(a) (like the provision\nfor plan modification in § 1329) entitles the debtor to a\ndischarge only \"after completion . . . of all payments under the\nplan.\" 11 U.S.C. § 1328(a) (emphasis added). See, e.g., In re\nCarr, 159 B.R. at 542 (noting that debtor did not \"complete\"\npayments where plan required payment \"in full\" on all priority\nclaims, and where the scheduled payments under the plan proved\ninsufficient to achieve that end); In re Delmonte, 237 B.R. at\n137 (\"A Chapter 13 debtor has a two-fold obligation under a\nconfirmed plan. It [sic] 'must make the plan payments required\nof it [sic] and those payments must be sufficient to do what the\nplan proposes.'\") (emphasis added; citation omitted). Further,\nsuch generic plan provisions (e.g., proposals to pay all\npriority claims in full) are necessary, since the proofs of\nclaims often are not filed until after the plan is confirmed.\nSee In re Carr, 159 B.R. at 540-41.\n\n                                      4\n\fpayments is due to circumstances for which debtor should not\n\njustly be held accountable . . . .\").                Her request for a\n\n\"hardship    discharge\"    represented     that    the    postpetition    tax\n\npenalties, which ultimately totaled more than $53,000, were\n\nincurred by her husband only, and even though she and her\n\nhusband had filed a joint chapter 13 petition, no order for\n\nconsolidated administration was ever entered by the bankruptcy\n\ncourt.   Thus, she argues, the bankruptcy court was obliged to\n\naccord   separate       treatment     to   their     respective     credit\n\nobligations.\n\n            Rulings on applications for discharge under Bankruptcy\n\nCode § 1328 are reviewed only for abuse of discretion.                    See\n\nBandilli v. Boyajian (In re Bandilli), 231 B.R. 836, 838 (B.A.P.\n\n1st Cir. 1999).     The ultimate evidentiary burden to establish an\n\nentitlement    to   a   hardship    discharge     under   Bankruptcy     Code\n\n§ 1328(b)(1) rested upon Sharon Roberts.            See id. at 839.\n\n            All the authorities she cites are inapposite, however,\n\nrelating instead to the entirely different matter as to whether\n\neach debtor in a joint proceeding is entitled to an independent\n\nhomestead exemption.       See, e.g., Cheesman v. Nachman, 656 F.2d\n\n60, 64 (4th Cir. 1981) (relying upon Bankruptcy Code § 522(m),\n\nwhich expressly empowers each debtor, in a joint case, to assert\n\na separate exemption claim).        Thus, the bankruptcy court plainly\n\n\n                                     5\n\fdid not abuse its discretion by denying the request for a\n\nhardship      discharge      under     Bankruptcy     Code     §   1328(b)(1),\n\nparticularly      in   light    of    (i)   Sharon    Roberts'     election   to\n\nproceed, with her husband, under a joint chapter 13 petition and\n\nplan,   and    (ii)    her   full    awareness   of   the    rapidly   accruing\n\npostpetition IRS tax obligations, combined with her subsequent\n\nfailure to move for severance.\n\n              The judgment is affirmed; costs to be assessed against\n\nappellants.      SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\f",

Her request for a \"hardship discharge\" represented that the postpetition tax penalties, which ultimately totaled more than $53,000, were incurred by her husband only, and even though she and her husband had filed a joint chapter 13 petition, no order for consolidated administration was ever entered by the bankruptcy court. Thus, she argues, the bankruptcy court was obliged to accord separate treatment to their respective credit obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rulings on applications for discharge under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 1328 are reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <i>See Bandilli v.

The ultimate evidentiary burden to establish an entitlement to a hardship discharge under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 1328(b)(1) rested upon Sharon Roberts. <i>See id.</i> at 839.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the authorities she cites are inapposite, however, relating instead to the entirely different matter as to whether each debtor in a joint proceeding is entitled to an independent homestead exemption. <i>See, e.g., Cheeseman v. Nachman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392977\"><a href=\"/opinion/392977/oliver-reginald-cheeseman-and-isabelle-cheeseman-v-erwin-b-nachman-in-re/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 64 (4th Cir.1981) (relying upon Bankruptcy Code &#167; 522(m), which <i>expressly</i> empowers each debtor, in a joint case, to assert a separate exemption claim). Thus, the bankruptcy court plainly did not abuse its discretion by denying the request for a hardship discharge under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 1328(b)(1), particularly in light of (i) Sharon Roberts' election to proceed, with her husband, under a joint chapter 13 petition and plan, and (ii) her full awareness of the rapidly accruing postpetition IRS tax obligations, combined with her subsequent failure to move for severance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The judgment is affirmed; costs to be assessed against appellants.

It [sic] `must make the plan payments required of it [sic] and those payments must be sufficient to do what the plan proposes.'\") (emphasis added; citation omitted). Further, such generic plan provisions (<i>e.g.,</i> proposals to pay all priority claims in full) are necessary, since the proofs of claims often are not filed until after the plan is confirmed. <i>See In re Carr,</i> 159 B.R. at 540-41.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
