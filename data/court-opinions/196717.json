Claimant  Adrian   Garcia-Martinez\r                                 \r\n\nappeals  from  the  district  court  judgment  affirming  the\r\n\ndecision of the  Secretary of Health and  Human Services that\r\n\nclaimant  is  not  entitled  to  Social  Security  disability\r\n\nbenefits.  Claimant raises four arguments on appeal:  (1) the\r\n\nadministrative  law  judge  (ALJ)  did not  comply  with  the\r\n\nAppeals  Council's  remand  order  to  obtain  more  evidence\r\n\nconcerning the existence of a mental impairment;  (2) the ALJ\r\n\nerred  in not  crediting the  opinion of  claimant's treating\r\n\nphysician  that claimant  was  completely disabled;  (3)  the\r\n\nALJ's finding that  claimant could return to his  past medium\r\n\nwork was  unsupported by the  record; and (4)  the vocational\r\n\nexpert  (VE) failed  to  take  into consideration  claimant's\r\n\nlimitations  on his  range  of motion.    We agree  with  the\r\n\ndistrict court's decision, adding the  following points keyed\r\n\nto claimant's arguments on appeal.\r\n\n          1.   The  ALJ obtained  the services  of a  medical\r\n\nadvisor, a  psychiatrist and  neurologist,  who reviewed  the\r\n\nentire  record  and observed  claimant  at the  hearing.   He\r\n\nopined  that claimant did not have a mental impairment.  This\r\n\nconclusion particularly was  supported by claimant's response\r\n\nto  the  question  why  he  had  stopped  working.    On  two\r\n\noccasions,  claimant  answered  that  his  physical  problems\r\n\nprevented him from continuing with his employment.   He never\r\n\nreferred to  any emotional symptoms, much  less described how\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nhis mental condition affected his ability  to engage in work-\r\n\nrelated  activities.  See Santiago v. Secretary of Health and\r                                                                         \r\n\nHuman  Services, 944 F.2d 1, 5-7 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam)\r                           \r\n\n(where the testimony and  the evidence did not go  far enough\r\n\nto raise  a \"meaningful  issue\" in  regard to  how claimant's\r\n\nimpairments affected her ability to work, the ALJ had no duty\r\n\nto  further   develop  the   record  by   obtaining  residual\r\n\nfunctional capacity assessments).\r\n\n          2.  The ALJ  did not err in not  giving controlling\r\n\nweight to  the opinion of claimant's  treating physician, Dr.\r\n\nMartinez, that  claimant was completely disabled.   Given the\r\n\nconflicting evidence, the  ALJ was not required  to accede to\r\n\nthe  treating physician's  opinion rather  than the  contrary\r\n\nevidence  of  the  medical  advisor  and  to  other  evidence\r\n\nsupporting  the latter's  position.   See Rodriguez  Pagan v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSecretary  of Health and Human  Services, 819 F.2d  1, 3 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\nCir. 1987) (per curiam), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1012 (1988).\r                                                 \r\n\n          3.  The uncontradicted residual functional capacity\r\n\nassessment  of  the  medical advisor  restricted  claimant to\r\n\nlifting 30 pounds;  medium work involves the ability  to lift\r\n\n50  pounds.   See  20 C.F.R.     404.1567(c).   Consequently,\r                             \r\n\nclaimant  cannot  perform  the  full range  of  medium  work.\r                                                \r\n\nHowever, the vocational expert  not only opined that claimant\r\n\ncould perform  his past, medium  work as a  groundskeeper, he\r\n\nalso  listed light jobs that  would be available to claimant.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nGiven that claimant can do some medium work, he  is deemed to\r\n\nbe able  to perform  light work.   Id.   Thus, the  Secretary\r                                                  \r\n\nsatisfied her burden, at step five of the sequential process,\r\n\nto  show that  there was other  work claimant  could perform.\r\n\nId.   404.1520(f).\r               \r\n\n          4.    There  was  conflicting  evidence  concerning\r\n\nclaimant's range of motion (for example, Dr. Stella-Arrillaga\r\n\nfound  no  limitations).   Thus, there  is  no basis  for the\r                     \r\n\nclaimant's  assertion  that  the  vocational  expert and  ALJ\r\n\ndisregarded  established limitations  on claimant's  range of\r\n\nmotion.  The  ALJ's decision  must stand.   See Rodriguez  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSecretary of  Health and  Human Services,  647 F.2d  218, 222\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1981)  (conflicts  in  the  evidence are  for  the\r\n\nSecretary to resolve).\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
